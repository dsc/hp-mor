possibly throw up: 1
in horror and: 1
sadly mistaken luminos: 1

rapidly but his: 1
think about how: 1
longer draco had: 1
effort for daphne: 1
coldly and if: 1

that they might: 1
things like ball: 1

come help me: 1
she was falling: 1

beside him granger: 1
it'd happen except: 1
in the slytherin: 1
being outnumbered two-to-one: 1
granger and padma: 1
now she was: 1
he'd drop anyone: 1

down into his: 1
the feather-falling potion: 1
my fingertips trying: 1

his general harry: 1
transfigure anything you: 1
of draco's shoes: 1
who'd drop a: 1
wasn't fair when: 1
it was skirting: 1
it would feel: 1
in draco's head: 1
um kinda sorry: 1
i didn't mean: 1
nothing but air: 1
stuck to the: 1
blinking hundreds of: 1
same cold determination: 1
in real life: 1
with a desperate: 1
he was about: 1
granger leveled hers: 1
millicent bulstrode retold: 1
in a conversational: 1
just feeling a: 1
single trace of: 1
who was standing: 1
using the item: 1
to finish off: 1
at him millicent: 1
you couldn't actually: 1
right now do: 1
had supplied granger: 1
because in daphne's: 1
eyes blazing without: 1
that draco sometimes: 1
of hogwarts with: 1
know why atlantis: 1
telling it right: 1
like harry potter: 1
millicent's improvements and: 1
which had rather: 1
was to jerk: 1
was coming rapidly: 1
from the main: 1
if you want: 1
when i'm fighting: 1
voice hermione kept: 1
all through the: 1
to trickle down: 1
say through gritted: 1
for themselves but: 1
to this the: 1
rooftop that had: 1
he wouldn't you: 1
ask him that: 1
them as ball: 1

only harry's army: 1
as it blew: 1
dramione's sungon argiment: 1
prismatic wall to: 1
as ball bearings: 1
go of you: 1
the stone which: 1
that stapped the: 1
heir of slipperin: 1
much experience apologizing: 1
tiniest smidgin of: 1
beaten but lose: 1
up draco was: 1
saw that harry: 1
head sounded an: 1
and shot general: 1
in almost perfect: 1
his back the: 1
guess i'll find: 1
open window with: 1
already swallowed the: 1
apologizing i'll fall: 1
smelled like ice: 1
could have made: 1
you were fighting: 1
but lose and: 1
of them actually: 1
usual classroom nice: 1
mistaken luminos shouted: 1
wouldn't be activated: 1
so that she: 1
really feel like: 1
feather-falling potion to: 1
she's a mudblood: 1
die i wonder: 1
and scrambling as: 1
a scream as: 1
what gasped flora: 1

closed windows and: 1
win for themselves: 1
of the allied: 1
a girl like: 1
the upper levels: 1
granger did the: 1
which was far: 1
they'd practiced for: 1
but instead her: 1
much longer draco: 1
fingertips of one: 1
hermione kept reading: 1
weeks instead of: 1
of me don't: 1
one might have: 1
did the same: 1
made hermione i: 1
your life aftermath: 1
his right hand: 1
to anything draco: 1
draco ended up: 1
balls granger had: 1
i guess i'll: 1
paint more like: 1
and early that: 1
to come help: 1
a brief tense: 1
gloves tightly to: 1
of the castle: 1
harry potter who: 1
over as far: 1
couldn't actually run: 1
it but instead: 1
himself and now: 1
wasn't crazy draco: 1
the girl but: 1
samuel his prismatic: 1
soldier now stood: 1
a little bit: 1
a mudblood said: 1
each other very: 1
whispered her eyes: 1
before then padma: 1
the slytherin girls': 1
ice and smelled: 1
have to win: 1
trying not to: 1
sweet of him: 1
both before falling: 1
to have ground: 1
oh be rational: 1
as soon as: 1
play tried climbing: 1
stories worth of: 1
you think villains: 1
trip and fall: 1
you're eating breakfast: 1
for the prismatic: 1
all over again: 1
once he grabbed: 1
cozy cool place: 1
rushed longbottom at: 1

the allied forces: 1
morale was high: 1
it you can: 1
waste a breaking: 1
that the best: 1
didn't look like: 1
general potter the: 1
the edge they: 1
at harry harry: 1
there was any: 1
to press his: 1
harry a slytherin: 1
him in a: 1
padma leveled her: 1
got to their: 1
make all the: 1
of the game: 1

his face showed: 1
right over the: 1
coordinated hover charms: 1
now the young: 1
fighting to win: 1
cool place in: 1
it was a: 1
distantly draco whispered: 1
charlotte wiland and: 1
if she'd hit: 1
ice some utterly: 1
draco there was: 1
but you could: 1
they could fly: 1
and stone turrets: 1
plop the icy: 1
going to come: 1
insisted on calling: 1
they'd fought all: 1
in practice sessions: 1
unless one of: 1
and grabbed for: 1
generals stepped together: 1
and somehow longbottom: 1
her eyes blazing: 1
obstacles they'd made: 1
creak open apologetically: 1
would feel safer: 1
greengrass to keep: 1
daphne couldn't resist: 1
harry potter's voice: 1
already too far: 1
without a single: 1
for their insignia: 1
accord there was: 1
girl like that: 1
carrow general granger: 1
said general granger: 1
was a slanted: 1
impact not just: 1
the open window: 1
how draco ended: 1
hands behind his: 1
to look down: 1
if that ground: 1
- the heir: 1
the date really: 1
to think about: 1
wonder why harry: 1
real life you: 1
bungee cords and: 1
over again next: 1
is doing this: 1
still stuck to: 1
would happen if: 1
daphne's opinion it: 1
to his wrists: 1

hogwarts that's what: 1
and draco without: 1
do just tell: 1
and then what: 1

wearing which used: 1
fighting seriously and: 1
under your feet: 1
some of granger's: 1
only she was: 1

for the enemy: 1
you can beat: 1
out his entire: 1

a white grip: 1
own people right: 1
as he swung: 1
same material to: 1
what d'you mean: 1

draco and granger: 1
stone walls and: 1
for this what: 1
staggered but he: 1
i mean general: 1
doses of feather-falling: 1
the story in: 1
easily in practice: 1

the dead end: 1
same time moving: 1
if she had: 1

this was to: 1
and slapped it: 1
the side of: 1
fingertips and buckles: 1
lake with fish: 1
off you'd better: 1
hand off the: 1
clamons whose hand: 1
standing behind the: 1
us there's no: 1
the main stone: 1
while her other: 1
think again beat: 1
let me go: 1
levels of hogwarts: 1

blazing without a: 1
the other hand: 1
what if malfoy's: 1
we have to: 1

feather-falling potion it: 1
i ah i: 1
off the top: 1
ball bearings on: 1
i'll be all: 1
anyone to keep: 1
patches of the: 1
way to thank: 1

held mysteriously behind: 1
and that just: 1
don't see why: 1
just a little: 1
but air they: 1
of his general: 1
already starting to: 1
the sunshine regiment: 1
and staircases rendering: 1
emptied out his: 1
why fired a: 1
swallowed the feather-falling: 1
' shouted charlotte: 1
ran and not: 1
dare the icy: 1
voice in draco's: 1
about me draco: 1
to keep to: 1
dug into the: 1
besides you can't: 1
tricks there'd been: 1
right arm and: 1
draco's head sounded: 1
together over longbottom's: 1
of romance in: 1
the two allied: 1
a single shot: 1
tired it had: 1
the material bounds: 1
and her other: 1
place then said: 1

kinda sorry i: 1
girls' common room: 1
whose hand was: 1
by my fingertips: 1
anything it had: 1
fingertips trying not: 1
sustain his prismatic: 1
he caught her: 1
to keep herself: 1
what can i: 1
them one might: 1
going to die: 1
you'd better think: 1
that part of: 1
the biting january: 1
and granger and: 1
no need to: 1
hurt draco's brain: 1
what yeah said: 1
to let your: 1
me that someday: 1
this time stick: 1
darkly you're eating: 1
of a smiling: 1
top of hogwarts: 1
floors and staircases: 1
millicent said dramatically: 1
with a grand: 1
hermione i mean: 1
the game so: 1
buckles that stapped: 1
did then he: 1
to waste a: 1
much the two: 1
be sadly mistaken: 1
date really said: 1
shouldn't have grabbed: 1
retrospect in real: 1
she would be: 1
me don't worry: 1
body even closer: 1
potter teaching lessons: 1
way to prevent: 1
back the battle: 1
than the stone: 1
me whispered the: 1
leveled his wand: 1
a sort of: 1
just in case: 1
a slanted roof: 1
next drop lord: 1
in retrospect in: 1
rooftop but some: 1
a lot more: 1
then you would: 1
idea how harry: 1
forces so badly: 1
have been easy: 1
gasped tracey that's: 1
fact what if: 1
villain now the: 1
couldn't last much: 1
air they were: 1
up at him: 1
hit just a: 1
soldiers of the: 1
next to daphne: 1
to their usual: 1
in a reflective: 1
one who made: 1
she said 'draco: 1
surprised protests of: 1
grabbed for granger's: 1
closer oh be: 1
granger looked up: 1
the floor in: 1
daphne greengrass to: 1
the slightest thought: 1
do it hermione: 1
body their boots: 1
was a lot: 1
horror and draco: 1
had emptied out: 1
behind the prismatic: 1
grabbed frantically and: 1
harry got there: 1
in silence it: 1
said 'never ': 1
might have been: 1
end of the: 1
classroom nice and: 1
as if she: 1
ceiling a little: 1
a slytherin boy: 1
that harry was: 1
of the combined: 1
potter you know: 1
to thank him: 1
gloves with a: 1
conversational voice if: 1
cornered the last: 1
nice and early: 1
and what do: 1
what do you: 1
were already starting: 1
said millicent he: 1
try impossibly to: 1
- there was: 1
this easy to: 1
in if you: 1
run your life: 1
it than the: 1
hard painful impact: 1
your feet again: 1
to make all: 1
exactly how to: 1
fell and so: 1
air underneath him: 1
a door to: 1
both generals the: 1
said the young: 1
said tracey 'cause: 1
devices into the: 1
there's no way: 1
jumped up and: 1
like hogwarts was: 1
young girl beside: 1
off the wall: 1
could lie down: 1
retold the story: 1
breakfast one day: 1
now but he: 1
seriously and i'll: 1
pause you can't: 1
of granger's weight: 1
held the wall: 1
convinced that he: 1
of a roof: 1
then what gasped: 1
so quickly -: 1
for the date: 1
them and harry: 1
dodging and scrambling: 1
about the six: 1
thing you know: 1
feeling a sort: 1
daphne said dramatically: 1
gaining until granger: 1
bit closer to: 1
wanted during the: 1
the same time: 1
to apologize to: 1
coming rapidly but: 1
even tighter all: 1
of millicent's improvements: 1
his body even: 1
they'd fought like: 1
harry and granger: 1
her book for: 1
and so long: 1
of air underneath: 1
as she slowly: 1
knowing that this: 1
a roof tile: 1
all blackened their: 1
a grand total: 1
uniforms - and: 1
might have thought: 1
hex before then: 1
and produced patches: 1
forces had cornered: 1
enough to know: 1
it that's why: 1
easy to finish: 1
across it at: 1
hanging onto the: 1
why daphne lowered: 1
toes of their: 1
the obstacles they'd: 1
but first he's: 1
that had jutted: 1
experience in fact: 1
next thing you: 1
allied generals stepped: 1
the soldiers of: 1
have followed them: 1
potter the end: 1
case not that: 1
into his soldiers: 1
and samuel and: 1
practiced coordinated hover: 1

or granger fired: 1
draco had already: 1
reading a book: 1
hogwarts whispering and: 1
do you suppose: 1
seer had told: 1
good a line: 1
and harry a: 1
determination that lit: 1
then padma leveled: 1
line for anyone: 1
as to what: 1
samuel clamons whose: 1

her voice in: 1
wand and looking: 1
there'd been tiny: 1
hitting the floor: 1
- and they'd: 1
metal balls granger: 1

follow if you: 1
a mudblood she: 1
perfectly good story: 1
his wrists beside: 1
quickly - there: 1

the young girl: 1
them were turning: 1
again and her: 1
have ground under: 1
shot general potter: 1
teeth could be: 1
know mr malfoy: 1
recent snow had: 1
almost perfect synchrony: 1
walls and you: 1
entire bag of: 1
finish off you'd: 1
didn't really feel: 1
speed then you: 1
the next thing: 1
good story already: 1
end there was: 1
in the world: 1
around them one: 1
said dramatically and: 1
said dramatically what: 1
waiting for the: 1
the battle had: 1
fury the cold: 1
hogwarts and that: 1
face showed the: 1
window his cold: 1
grabbed her he: 1
nightfall it was: 1
you wanted during: 1
have been a: 1
weasley and vincent: 1
and whistling in: 1
resist any more: 1
look like paint: 1
traitors despite the: 1
had rather a: 1
past closed windows: 1
potter on the: 1
like they'd burned: 1
falling off the: 1
you want or: 1
longbottom had managed: 1
it at a: 1
showed the same: 1
me draco i: 1
approaching certain doom: 1
safe harry potter: 1
of hogwarts that's: 1
they could have: 1
fighting for a: 1
running beneath the: 1
he dropped her: 1
tone as she: 1
falling and pulling: 1
on how he: 1
harry harry was: 1
biting january wind: 1
their usual classroom: 1
pouch just in: 1
didn't mean for: 1
draco without even: 1
climbing around the: 1
around them draco's: 1
to glue transfigured: 1
too and if: 1
sudden gust made: 1
you to actually: 1
beside him in: 1
was amazing how: 1
watching them and: 1
eyes of his: 1
all happened so: 1
fought each other: 1
you could lie: 1
hand was going: 1
one day at: 1
parkinson nodded nope: 1
them impassable until: 1
onto the side: 1
that after i: 1
fall to my: 1
the survivors of: 1
that's because you: 1
um said harry: 1
vincent had rushed: 1
padma and samuel: 1
off the roof: 1
holding onto granger's: 1
they might just: 1
a world free: 1
together easily in: 1
to hang on: 1
longbottom at the: 1
must have looked: 1
and draco looked: 1
1 it was: 1
the item professor: 1
even closer to: 1
potion to carry: 1
to actually fall: 1
smiling face wreathed: 1
an effort for: 1
said granger after: 1
grayish material on: 1
sunshine general gasped: 1
mistake there was: 1
the stone walls: 1
boy raised by: 1
it probably wasn't: 1
entertaining experience in: 1
tightly to his: 1
not that padma: 1
with a face: 1
trace of fear: 1
anyway she wasn't: 1
safer to have: 1
next morning it: 1
looking at them: 1
generals the soldiers: 1
the sunshine general: 1
the stone again: 1
then he jumped: 1
potter's army in: 1
too far off: 1
a single trace: 1
but his face: 1
her hand plopped: 1
like malfoy dropped: 1
upward to sustain: 1
like it hadn't: 1
to themselves so: 1
draco i promise: 1
fly their own: 1
peculiar grayish material: 1
book in silence: 1
gasped in horror: 1
was falling and: 1
worth of empty: 1
hand grabbed frantically: 1
mostly because in: 1
like ice some: 1
hermione granger whispered: 1
argiment and produced: 1
of feather-falling potion: 1
didn't fall they: 1
stone face and: 1
improvements and then: 1
draco didn't really: 1
how to apologize: 1
you could transfigure: 1
of hogwarts he's: 1
davis sitting next: 1
wall to fall: 1
her pouch just: 1
doubt was dumbledore: 1
was taking a: 1
lifted i'll have: 1
could transfigure anything: 1
flames but harry's: 1
world free of: 1
peeled the fingertips: 1
raised by scientists: 1
yourself we have: 1
grabbed her in: 1
and buckles that: 1
amazing how much: 1
to be blown: 1
right daphne said: 1
had jutted out: 1
they'd fought each: 1
trying very hard: 1
he let go: 1
what if he's: 1
far off balance: 1
the best way: 1
it down on: 1
it was amazing: 1
had cornered the: 1
like they'd practiced: 1
all of millicent's: 1
the gloves he: 1
or buy you: 1
item professor quirrell: 1
harry potter's fault: 1
rendering them impassable: 1
and he caught: 1
their own insignia: 1
already in motion: 1
bearings on floors: 1
you and you're: 1
for a world: 1
the quibbler's headline: 1
exactly two doses: 1
potion it was: 1
general granger in: 1
tiny metal balls: 1
their boots hitting: 1
impossibly to press: 1
drop me pansy: 1
harry could apologize: 1
figure was dodging: 1
do it draco: 1
that's right daphne: 1
know each other: 1
be by herself: 1
to what would: 1
charlotte he's a: 1
breathing was coming: 1
a bit of: 1
hiding his hands: 1
the castle hogwarts: 1
together like they'd: 1
kept reading the: 1
was still hiding: 1
shrieked distantly draco: 1
was a sound: 1
from a distance: 1
then he said: 1
better think again: 1
by the looks: 1
wiland and held: 1
place in the: 1
them both before: 1
about things like: 1
lessons are you: 1
anything you wanted: 1
sort of odd: 1
cords and so: 1
tell me she: 1
ground under your: 1
icy slanted rooftops: 1
beside draco the: 1
all over hogwarts: 1
be rational the: 1
he'd drop you: 1
him that after: 1
in the dungeons: 1
rage that draco: 1
carry around in: 1
you know malfoy: 1
boy said coldly: 1
but occasional patches: 1
running and it: 1
a face that: 1
is - the: 1
of harry potter's: 1
to know each: 1
kill harry potter: 1
best way to: 1
go well malfoy: 1
that ground was: 1
said tracey besides: 1
to transfigure the: 1
in the face: 1
that someday i'd: 1
he held the: 1
and smelled like: 1
other hand clenched: 1
hers at harry: 1
of a rooftop: 1
and also inevitably: 1
but some of: 1
wearing strange gloves: 1
childish play tried: 1
army in a: 1
instead on how: 1
you for this: 1
managed to hex: 1
a peculiar grayish: 1
my knees if: 1
beneath the hogwarts: 1
gritted teeth could: 1
are you going: 1
stone turrets the: 1
after all this: 1
despite the surprised: 1
battle had been: 1
of tricks there'd: 1
first place then: 1
feel safer to: 1
boy brought his: 1
wreathed in flames: 1
padma would have: 1
said darkly you're: 1
wall at the: 1
hogwarts he's going: 1
it was coming: 1
skirting the edges: 1
wrists beside draco: 1
the next morning: 1
harry's soldiers had: 1
same they'd already: 1
might just lose: 1
earlier the two: 1
bag of tricks: 1
in fact what: 1
worry about me: 1
granger whispered her: 1
perfect synchrony only: 1
or anything it: 1
into the game: 1
lose and we'll: 1
on the fingertips: 1
sounding confused of: 1
very hard not: 1
you were running: 1
was any way: 1
granger fired now: 1
going to kill: 1
a mistake there: 1
without even asking: 1
army had insisted: 1
as millicent bulstrode: 1
was standing behind: 1
the outer wall: 1
made you couldn't: 1
a sudden gust: 1
hands held mysteriously: 1
pointless instinct seemed: 1
doom tracey davis: 1
next time the: 1
nodded nope said: 1
well malfoy shouldn't: 1
harry had supplied: 1
wasn't as if: 1
we'll be doing: 1
of a castle: 1
just wasn't fair: 1
stone wall of: 1
two doses of: 1
protests of both: 1
be hanging onto: 1
the roof or: 1
to have in: 1
the enemy being: 1
the potion wouldn't: 1
were gaining until: 1
to the edge: 1
was blinking hundreds: 1
to an open: 1
right and what: 1
me she kept: 1
it was all: 1
demarcated the material: 1
the voice in: 1
kept reading i'm: 1
then harry spoke: 1
at samuel granger: 1
been tiny metal: 1
now stood between: 1
sitting next to: 1
pitches as it: 1
and then harry: 1
fired now they: 1
malfoy is -: 1
it wasn't as: 1
go dropping girls: 1
feet again but: 1
soldiers had all: 1
anyone he'd drop: 1
impassable until cleared: 1
an open window: 1
pansy said daphne: 1
the tiniest smidgin: 1
perfectly completely utterly: 1
was creaking open: 1
time stick plop: 1
be activated unless: 1
running across it: 1
by scientists who: 1
prismatic wall the: 1
coming closer oh: 1
book for a: 1
there was no: 1
their own people: 1
the rooftop and: 1
odd curiosity as: 1
certain doom tracey: 1
draco do it: 1
buy you something: 1
at the edge: 1
somehow longbottom had: 1
the one who: 1
luminos both of: 1
made it but: 1
hang on especially: 1
his hands held: 1
of the corridor: 1
common draco didn't: 1
edge of the: 1
of speed and: 1
got there if: 1
stone which felt: 1
managed to say: 1
out from the: 1
let your brain: 1
happened so quickly: 1
you can't do: 1
know how to: 1
was high both: 1
wasn't there was: 1
me pansy said: 1
harry spoke i'm: 1
atlantis fell said: 1
quibbler's headline aftermath: 1
harry was already: 1
'never ' shouted: 1
bluff it probably: 1
be serious harry: 1
from outside but: 1
you can't just: 1
said 'draco you've: 1
was telling it: 1
promise i'll be: 1
stood between them: 1
that's why daphne: 1
this what can: 1
and how to: 1
strange gloves with: 1
been quite an: 1
ice still stuck: 1
along in firm: 1
dramatically and she: 1
that said charlotte: 1
in motion and: 1
voice said follow: 1
stretched it over: 1
confused of course: 1
in harry had: 1
either right now: 1
had come to: 1
a witch dropper: 1
lot like harry: 1
some utterly pointless: 1
army had already: 1
for granger's right: 1
been play and: 1
on especially in: 1
firm agreement i: 1
stunned pause you: 1
why said pansy: 1
granger had identified: 1
snow had mostly: 1
all the muggleborns: 1
about to be: 1
over hogwarts and: 1
granger slip in: 1
you're falling off: 1
armies knowing that: 1
talking right now: 1
felt like ice: 1
as far as: 1
fall off the: 1
empty air underneath: 1
weren't using the: 1
brief tense silence: 1
occasional patches of: 1
a sound of: 1
i don't know: 1
indeed morale was: 1
and you're falling: 1
until cleared only: 1
the fingertips of: 1
and so it: 1
daphne was nodding: 1
very well indeed: 1
granger after all: 1
of odd curiosity: 1
own wand at: 1
harry shouted granger: 1
spoke i'm the: 1
some truly romantic: 1
back down again: 1
would be sadly: 1
which used something: 1
said pansy that's: 1
with a peculiar: 1
that also yesterday: 1
'cause someone like: 1
of an effort: 1
was about to: 1
themselves dramione's sungon: 1
listening girls except: 1
of slipperin the: 1
time the boy: 1
bring devices into: 1
again but if: 1
underneath him and: 1
still hiding his: 1
an extended sticky: 1
you know mr: 1
they'd already swallowed: 1
look down or: 1
all the listening: 1
weren't just fighting: 1
as it ran: 1
you mean -: 1
said charlotte she's: 1
lets go of: 1
melted and refrozen: 1
all right and: 1
jerk around in: 1
tracey 'cause someone: 1
harry potter you: 1
couldn't bring devices: 1
had already practiced: 1
named samuel clamons: 1
the distant figure: 1
with her it: 1
hermione made sure: 1
if malfoy is: 1
go of me: 1
malfoy lets go: 1
of you and: 1
rooftop and the: 1
high both armies: 1
roof tiled with: 1
like ice and: 1
millicent he dropped: 1
when harry got: 1
ground was a: 1
that evening just: 1
her nothing but: 1
wall with an: 1
to sustain his: 1
hex them both: 1
fighting a boy: 1
doing this all: 1
and bungee cords: 1
herself quiet as: 1
quite an entertaining: 1
charlotte she's a: 1
keep herself quiet: 1
own accord there: 1
the game from: 1
he managed to: 1
material bounds of: 1
six stories worth: 1
his hands behind: 1
stone again beside: 1
the same material: 1
clenched white around: 1
was how draco: 1
on the edge: 1
mr malfoy said: 1
moving together like: 1
he grabbed her: 1
was far too: 1
out the open: 1
people right over: 1
reading her book: 1
have to ask: 1
fear do it: 1
suppose malfoy did: 1
to creak open: 1
to granger exactly: 1
at the dead: 1
see why said: 1
of both generals: 1
hermione harry's voice: 1
after i kill: 1
fall you mean: 1
out to have: 1
any idea of: 1
boy named samuel: 1
underneath her nothing: 1
and that was: 1
and draco saw: 1
for daphne greengrass: 1
of the rooftop: 1
the listening girls: 1
teaching lessons are: 1
with an extended: 1

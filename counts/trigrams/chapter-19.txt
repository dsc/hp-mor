on whether or: 1
down when it: 1

almost as sharp: 1
the repeater screens: 1
how you lost: 1
library scrutinizing the: 1
everyone in slytherin's: 1
rolled and sprang: 1

they were dismissed: 1
why mr goyle: 1
professor quirrell draco's: 1
slytherin first all: 1
a quirrell point: 1

moments when the: 1
that good you: 1
careful not to: 1
they used their: 1
upon his strict: 1
danger you escalated: 1
you've obviously got: 1

that would make: 1
time mr potter: 1
too fast for: 1
saw the elated: 1
that there was: 1
hint of pain: 1
laughed but not: 1
than a fist: 1
a price to: 1
why he could: 1
of his classmates: 1
closer friends i'm: 1
i'm sorry draco: 1
of sheer shock: 1
went up and: 1
should go without: 1

to learn would: 1
could defeat even: 1
both flushing through: 1
in a sort: 1
that i or: 1

to force the: 1
frantic i know: 1
maybe even a: 1
of a wizened: 1
fabric seemed to: 1
subtly turning his: 1
and cold anger: 1
of this defense: 1
- just if: 1
to exploit it: 1
sheathed and accept: 1
to be called: 1
composed dark wizards: 1

what had happened: 1
you mr potter: 1
and neither will: 1
ravenclaw and it: 1
you would come: 1

that severus was: 1
an arm's length: 1
fool wouldn't be: 1
his blood which: 1
potter does become: 1
learned them i: 1
you were trying: 1
quirrell from the: 1
activity and now: 1
him now he: 1
trying to help: 1
as the one: 1
recovered a little: 1
cunning and dull: 1
god skulls for: 1
harry said not: 1
were staring at: 1
harry said now: 1
of the dojo: 1
one thing the: 1
complicated plotting anyway: 1
you have just: 1
of action and: 1
look maybe because: 1
quirrell said that: 1
in merlin's name: 1
harry swallowed professor: 1
make people realize: 1
do any of: 1
and fell over: 1
or out of: 1
than a few: 1
was very slightly: 1
he left without: 1
yes draco said: 1
faltering don't hurt: 1
and more urgent: 1
you wish to: 1
how to fall: 1
then their enemy: 1
pathetic enough he'll: 1
stared back at: 1

a sort of: 1
as quirrell slouched: 1

row looked like: 1
stop himself yes: 1
malfoy was applauding: 1
me said draco: 1
way and he: 1
in the light: 1
and he'd meant: 1
and resumed leaning: 1
deliberately and bumped: 1
just do it: 1
begged the older: 1
him to the: 1
the ravenclaw students: 1
better when it: 1
forget the most: 1
gravely you worry: 1
you sure harry: 1
never brag to: 1
mentors and you: 1
in utter clarity: 1
claws sheathed but: 1
the professor blocked: 1
not thought of: 1
was careful not: 1
battle magic the: 1
of nostalgia for: 1
a wall or: 1
coming the dark: 1
expecting that neither: 1
was some secret: 1
the light of: 1
hadn't been right: 1
place to that: 1
a request to: 1
dark lord asked: 1
entirely or snape: 1

to throw until: 1
fall and i: 1
applause to die: 1

secrets and i: 1
quirrell there are: 1

seated and staring: 1
far far too: 1
that's an odd: 1
whether they were: 1
end of my: 1
sight and he: 1
it is also: 1
the first item: 1
some chance you: 1
boy-who-lived down a: 1
most of ravenclaw: 1

faltered his mind: 1
all terrors -: 1
crucioed the master's: 1
the reaction was: 1
you any offensive: 1
himself straightened up: 1
for not long: 1
indignation he had: 1
it harry could: 1
discipline and the: 1
some poor anonymous: 1
had my lesson: 1
boy fully half: 1
on the table: 1
both that you: 1
to cry and: 1
have no patience: 1
please don't plan: 1
that signals friendship: 1
time-turner harry had: 1
i believe the: 1
falling from the: 1
arts is not: 1
to another set: 1
returned escorting thirteen: 1
potter is avada: 1
claws sheathed and: 1
gryffindor and hufflepuff: 1
minions they won't: 1
curse the cruciatus: 1
sometimes and you: 1
and his hands: 1
at once like: 1
a desire to: 1
ah never brag: 1
and escalating the: 1
lord there was: 1
dark i was: 1
be blamed for: 1
of shock they: 1
their respect wash: 1
remember how you: 1
you that your: 1
you place on: 1
pain will come: 1
harry could see: 1
- lose said: 1
you that derrick: 1
back of the: 1
this day forward: 1
hadn't seemed to: 1
right way and: 1
rather nervous harry: 1
has it occurred: 1
was more frightened: 1
didn't trust this: 1
correct and he: 1
harry it was: 1
demons for whatever: 1
like to say: 1
up most wizards: 1
as he said: 1
slytherin's wondering about: 1
you manage to: 1
wrestling an anaconda: 1
this or you're: 1
first losing must: 1
me that there: 1
any offensive spells: 1
important life lesson: 1
harry was panting: 1
not the one: 1
my fingers harry: 1
accurate description of: 1
dark lord or: 1
the master surprisingly: 1
winced me neither: 1
grateful to you: 1
slytherins they were: 1
up into a: 1
wants even then: 1
could not even: 1
course i applied: 1
why severus wasn't: 1
now become greater: 1
it would stay: 1
keep their claws: 1
harry said he: 1
don't have to: 1
didn't seem to: 1
get this promoted: 1
master followed i: 1
their loftier perches: 1
an acceptable level: 1
does anyone else: 1
hurry up and: 1
eyes and struggled: 1
and no mentors: 1
dark wizards cannot: 1
had severely hurt: 1
desk not because: 1
were gasps from: 1
' harry was: 1
i will ask: 1
scattering of hufflepuffs: 1
been a friend: 1
i went through: 1
objections mr potter: 1
i know draco: 1
change the fact: 1
an exploitable weakness: 1
had their lesson: 1
to me and: 1
dark lord ripped: 1
a complicated way: 1
instead harry looked: 1
to be dumbledore's: 1
you harbor an: 1
and that meant: 1
from his back: 1
who harbored ambitions: 1
shifted back to: 1
we all have: 1
the best possible: 1
desk he looked: 1
certain vitally important: 1
professor mcgonagall had: 1
my classes who: 1
to them why: 1
the history of: 1
alone and total: 1
it harry said: 1
not know martial: 1
in jeopardy and: 1
faces showing not: 1
two on the: 1
how they were: 1
to throw up: 1
ways to placate: 1
you had severely: 1
him be dominant: 1
and gave a: 1
of seats harry: 1
contests they rush: 1
make sense of: 1
time it sounded: 1
demanded - not: 1
and i knew: 1
disguise glowing red: 1
classroom a silence: 1
moment later derrick: 1
in a small: 1
blurs in draco's: 1
mistake and being: 1
and 'i admit: 1
moment and went: 1
to be something: 1
draco said exultantly: 1
involved there was: 1
dumb but it: 1
you cannot for: 1
today was dumb: 1
but then their: 1
that's a request: 1
that confrontation were: 1
than my magic: 1
sometimes we forget: 1
most wizards professor: 1
too many books: 1
should have and: 1
master told him: 1
class - we: 1

temperature was dropping: 1
i will describe: 1
though he had: 1
professor quirrell whew: 1
will not teach: 1
just i don't: 1
harry leaned back: 1
in time draco: 1
out at harry: 1
a certain vitally: 1
there's no point: 1
during one of: 1
three quirrell points: 1
i must not: 1
is no -: 1
ordinarily he would: 1
professor - professor: 1
hogwarts and he: 1
like an insult: 1
said in the: 1
was a prodigy: 1
left without a: 1
dominance over the: 1
but no the: 1
is please wait: 1
think this calls: 1
voice even further: 1
precise frighteningly precise: 1
over and report: 1
give you good: 1
vast auditorium where: 1
in ravenclaw knows: 1
and he realized: 1
quirrell's face hardened: 1
describe it more: 1
look of great: 1
a winner and: 1
win that day: 1
resumed there is: 1
some reason and: 1
to the departing: 1
the doors class: 1
have hurt i: 1
because i would: 1
must be thinkable: 1
want to know: 1
say that yesterday: 1
his mind utterly: 1
harry grinned involuntarily: 1
impressed with mr: 1
idiot what part: 1
the marble stage: 1
- was that: 1
place on the: 1
think this will: 1
keep your secrets: 1
um never use: 1
like a massive: 1
potter he said: 1
whole thing to: 1
his mind well-honed: 1
and cheering and: 1
is true professor: 1
mutual consent the: 1
importance has now: 1
guess what they: 1
and to each: 1
for whatever reason: 1
please take it: 1
you've got no: 1
his feet he: 1
shoved harry sending: 1
who makes a: 1
lost control and: 1
about snape sneaking: 1
my compliments on: 1
such good friends: 1
the departing slytherins: 1
his hands professor: 1
anger is natural: 1
quirrell slouched toward: 1
you see an: 1
rush the dark: 1
dojo lined up: 1
business deal now: 1
and does not: 1
learned this from: 1
what precisely did: 1
it was one: 1
someone to explain: 1
among the ravenclaw: 1
pulled up so: 1
after all professor: 1
expressionless upon his: 1
from professor snape: 1
teasing me so: 1
me but we: 1
derrick pushed harry: 1
can answer in: 1
one spoke draco: 1
that you were: 1
behind him talk: 1
and knew he: 1
missing i repeat: 1
you to get: 1
snape would have: 1
stop said professor: 1
wait until after: 1
pushing and quirrell: 1
you so quickly: 1
let's go beat: 1
deserves an extraordinary: 1
opinion that you: 1
that i ended: 1
utterly exhausted he: 1
defined muscles facial: 1
the sound of: 1
your teacher and: 1
you go the: 1
been right at: 1
paws - with: 1
brag to anyone: 1
stay there if: 1
over him feeling: 1
goyle's cunning mr: 1
so if you're: 1
of his headlong: 1
from professor quirrell: 1
beloved son i've: 1
a single lesson: 1
will you remember: 1
i left that: 1
would you care: 1
he'd meant it: 1
those eyes i: 1
kill harry's wand: 1
wave of idiots: 1
is avada kedavra: 1
could have killed: 1
elementary point now: 1
voice turned very: 1
robes somehow looked: 1
that you found: 1
even though he: 1
understand all right: 1
me professor quirrell: 1
little discussion by: 1
a touch of: 1
relieved note professor: 1
a bird chirping: 1
but awe the: 1
fingers harry stop: 1
i knew that: 1
this has happened: 1
spend - the: 1
now that was: 1
to trust you: 1
the phoenix present: 1
the direction of: 1
good father's been: 1
there is only: 1
plotting anyway harry: 1
was terror there: 1
first-years understood by: 1
you and that: 1
more formal cadence: 1
and attacked my: 1
just found out: 1
but severus wasn't: 1
later derrick pushed: 1
never use a: 1
strange coming from: 1
bumped into me: 1
dumbledore hadn't seemed: 1
all right harry: 1
harry ached all: 1
ambition to be: 1
reputation among fighting: 1
that hidden place: 1
one the dark: 1
for someone to: 1
lucius thinks maybe: 1
particularly humiliating fashion: 1
afraid to attack: 1
me now harry: 1
their desks so: 1
him that it: 1
ally harry ached: 1
slytherins had expressions: 1
particularly impressed with: 1
harry sending him: 1
mr potter that: 1
face was fierce: 1
lesson the dark: 1
felt cold his: 1
struggled to sit: 1
brain made a: 1
avoid getting angry: 1
back to professor: 1
partner - yikes: 1
around like that: 1
more scattered laughter: 1
great risks that: 1
i'm sorry you: 1
through the air: 1
bit of blackmail: 1
smiling even though: 1
with the full: 1
he-who-must-not-be-named there was: 1
broke out among: 1
then the screen: 1
one who threw: 1
now serious went: 1
was working perfectly: 1
to raise himself: 1
a burning sensation: 1
thought into his: 1
when a hogwarts: 1
in ravenclaw and: 1
i see that: 1
quirrell would you: 1
on friday harry: 1
have limits but: 1
dark lord -: 1
mover the applause: 1
first harry leaned: 1
a clearly recognizable: 1
people pointed out: 1
boy being abused: 1
and harry opened: 1
a fact that: 1
of the hogwarts: 1
suspicious of him: 1
then professor quirrell's: 1
still in stance: 1
to be in: 1
was looking exultant: 1
formal cadence my: 1
wednesday no we: 1
reading from the: 1
he really really: 1
me ' harry: 1
very stupid thing: 1
still being repeated: 1
from childhood to: 1
my lesson to: 1
- enough said: 1
lose please don't: 1
professor quirrell that: 1
young slytherin this: 1
weak to beat: 1
of a promise: 1
been - i: 1
all his students: 1
hindbrain despite everything: 1
a massive thunderclap: 1
be hurt and: 1
of what he: 1
that it happens: 1
lessons i had: 1
said though he: 1
your actions do: 1
the melody and: 1
him any sort: 1
the tale and: 1
on mr potter: 1
you but first: 1
this was perhaps: 1
said nothing a: 1
left in this: 1
sections of the: 1
as worn by: 1
not to defend: 1
potter please accept: 1
that part too: 1
would not surprise: 1
really really should: 1
said after a: 1
their tempers professor: 1
to stop that: 1
claws heedless of: 1
but an image: 1
them draco nodded: 1
simply apparated through: 1
ached all over: 1
mean if draco: 1
long since passed: 1
granger into a: 1
the cold anger: 1
the brilliant professor: 1
you think he: 1
dojo a muggle: 1
trying to get: 1
draco i'll promise: 1
really shouldn't do: 1
that too said: 1
were trying to: 1
he graduates the: 1
rather weakly i: 1
i at your: 1
scrutinizing the lives: 1
wizards professor quirrell: 1
significant and he: 1
draco was looking: 1
draco of the: 1
quirrell's voice faltered: 1
blue mat such: 1
to snape so: 1
you learn -: 1
was 'i will: 1
and his ill-fated: 1
started talking his: 1
only one response: 1
next defense class: 1
enemy the defense: 1
enough no reason: 1
we are not: 1
avada kedavra professor: 1
experience will not: 1
they're mine i'm: 1
his face now: 1
confront your fear: 1
accidents will be: 1
tuesday wednesday no: 1
known that he: 1
harry to make: 1
trying to imagine: 1
or punched me: 1
still have half: 1
that day his: 1
contest when a: 1
severus go on: 1
whooshing out stop: 1
perches that is: 1
understood by some: 1
harry couldn't take: 1
world would be: 1
classroom harry hadn't: 1
it known that: 1
when it looked: 1
first item was: 1
when he tried: 1
talking about leaving: 1
nod not all: 1
third door from: 1
you've got the: 1
stronger than a: 1
have time to: 1
this attitude is: 1
his students had: 1
frighteningly precise now: 1
harry looked at: 1
ancestor of today's: 1
was not particularly: 1
refuses to use: 1
to be paid: 1
fashion that snape: 1
of losing you: 1
what was going: 1
will find a: 1
he hit the: 1
then so was: 1
able to catch: 1
quirrell if you: 1
and someone pointed: 1
held to the: 1
yes mr potter: 1
best possible time: 1
talking and professor: 1
to join in: 1
snape sneaking into: 1
case when i: 1
small quick thumbs-up: 1
attitude is exactly: 1
acceptable if i: 1
was leaning on: 1
looks of it: 1
you have no: 1
then you escalated: 1
like your worst: 1
grinned involuntarily and: 1
where snape confronted: 1
even then so: 1
possible time to: 1
there swaying letting: 1
or even killed: 1
face hardened and: 1
can teach you: 1
it two harry: 1
you not know: 1
could have walked: 1
you could break: 1
period i know: 1
hogwarts library scrutinizing: 1
had been sincere: 1
and then harry: 1
not long afterward: 1
not saying anything: 1
i anticipated your: 1
was true i: 1
dumbledore doesn't want: 1
a level which: 1
somehow harry tapped: 1
so low that: 1
of ten house: 1
the road may: 1
difficulty of losing: 1
to ravenclaw there: 1
professor we really: 1
bestowed a look: 1
and professor mcgonagall: 1
hesitation interesting then: 1
must not teach: 1
seemed to come: 1
wrong said professor: 1
'looks like harry: 1
face showed utter: 1
strong as you: 1
awareness never mind: 1
two my mr: 1
there might have: 1
surprised pause in: 1
friends as yet: 1
the full approval: 1
over you instead: 1
be more than: 1
but harry draco: 1
him dread was: 1
sneaking into your: 1
that your experience: 1
fled and the: 1
angry or at: 1
or not but: 1
to that school: 1
them soon learns: 1
just not sure: 1
that shoved him: 1
students had died: 1
had been called: 1
i don't want: 1
again but there: 1
not understand if: 1
swayed to his: 1
although professor quirrell: 1
been flowing and: 1
managed to say: 1
sank he had: 1
it did get: 1
people realize he: 1
around nervously some: 1
the first time: 1
little but but: 1
lowering his voice: 1
textbooks now go: 1
harry's stomach sank: 1
of all the: 1
our head of: 1
be just what: 1
not be professor: 1
describes you surely: 1
to worry about: 1
after they're gone: 1
narrow course that: 1
to an acceptable: 1
mr peregrine derrick: 1
dojo which professor: 1
understand harry said: 1
said i'm just: 1
already this has: 1
this case will: 1
sharply he staggered: 1
do it professor: 1
his finger keep: 1
yesterday i was: 1
fights after i: 1
of battle magic: 1
as any muggle: 1
many breaths being: 1
in the direction: 1
harry felt the: 1
had been flowing: 1
quirrell wrong wrong: 1
students were standing: 1
destroy dumbledore entirely: 1
would make people: 1
hands not quite: 1
over dumbledore the: 1
me everyone harry: 1
are prodigies draco: 1
to nod not: 1
theory is true: 1
this equally annoying: 1
about to be: 1
the words out: 1
does not always: 1
ask what level: 1
just what salazar: 1
to take it: 1
do not know: 1
yes professor said: 1
harry clenched his: 1
fifty-one points to: 1
you learn how: 1
with a twisted: 1
plan professor quirrell: 1
on his chest: 1
the lives and: 1
most valuable lessons: 1
i swear never: 1
well to magical: 1
accept the results: 1
sort of significant: 1
- the master: 1
that wouldn't hurt: 1
as what i: 1
powerful enough to: 1
idiot professor quirrell: 1
think so i: 1
a favor because: 1
again seemed calm: 1
i and if: 1
the obvious thing: 1
how in merlin's: 1
quiet even within: 1
dojo taught a: 1
he will hunt: 1
quirrell so while: 1
again and then: 1
was professor quirrell: 1
no one spoke: 1
was still being: 1
pointed out was: 1
said exultantly harry's: 1
and accept the: 1
fall correctly when: 1
gesture most of: 1
why with their: 1
hard perhaps the: 1
him was a: 1
their desks or: 1
floor for when: 1
with interesting potions: 1
or even given: 1
talking it's obvious: 1
for nothing but: 1
do not understand: 1
spat upon harry: 1
harry swayed to: 1
said draco yeah: 1
professor quirrell what: 1
leader into a: 1
things too like: 1
student or two: 1
it is please: 1
he sees that: 1
harry said smiling: 1
can we do: 1
again professor quirrell: 1
quirrell there was: 1
was grinning widely: 1
felt a burning: 1
of him entirely: 1
said do not: 1
arched his back: 1
presence i deduced: 1
raised you are: 1
compromises and negotiated: 1
accomplish nothing but: 1
an image of: 1
confronting it even: 1
but not many: 1
extra house points: 1
deliberately endured being: 1
this time the: 1
that he hadn't: 1
make the appropriate: 1
still keeping him: 1
platform looking rather: 1
do this was: 1
it is evident: 1
quirrell i lose: 1
stakes you place: 1
at hogwarts in: 1
icily wrong said: 1
put slytherin house: 1
can guess that: 1
point in asking: 1
in his chair: 1
where you will: 1
be in a: 1
means your brain: 1
was battle magic: 1
what i would: 1
manage to make: 1
other time no: 1
through the narrow: 1
learned which was: 1
think you are: 1
face was serious: 1
sheathed surely if: 1
second thought i: 1
is a lie: 1
are called dominance: 1
you better when: 1
and i believe: 1
someday teach at: 1
come forward yes: 1
must be in: 1
followed i learned: 1
all four houses: 1
going through the: 1
was a humiliation: 1
leaning on his: 1
and report the: 1
children were draco: 1
we been reading: 1
their chairs and: 1
you that i: 1
snape to tell: 1
a particularly humiliating: 1
that hadn't been: 1
smart people pointed: 1
didn't share it: 1
knew that he: 1
you didn't tell: 1
hurt any and: 1
you tell me: 1
yeah talk you: 1
would kick snape: 1
potter today you: 1
not shouted mr: 1
groin would stun: 1
made no use: 1
out - a: 1
on the other: 1
was pushed hard: 1
left in particular: 1
to tell him: 1
stop ' and: 1
after i graduate: 1
sickening thing it: 1
you will not: 1
simply failing there: 1
potter of course: 1
victory victory at: 1
just wished his: 1
to the imagination: 1
who will be: 1
how many allies: 1
indeed said professor: 1
different if mornelithe: 1
significant glance at: 1
that was number: 1
cadence draco had: 1
to destroy dumbledore: 1
eyes i learned: 1
endured being spat: 1
lose mr malfoy: 1
harry paused huzzah: 1
it derrick said: 1
hit the ground: 1
say 'i lose: 1
the ground sounding: 1
come straight out: 1
thinks maybe i: 1
lay on professor: 1
part too harry: 1
changed today's lesson: 1
of hogwarts and: 1
education and already: 1
dark lord crucioed: 1
push someone into: 1
that i had: 1
do not snap: 1
dignified professor quirrell: 1
which was not: 1
asked why he: 1
harry's blood temperature: 1
harry fell to: 1
and who had: 1
the most basic: 1
for it now: 1
derrick put a: 1
looking grave anger: 1
this miraculous respect: 1
auditorium where all: 1
from the difficulty: 1
dark lords and: 1
fifteen seconds for: 1
student whom the: 1
out of friendship: 1
said smiling i: 1
slapped back and: 1
and harry fell: 1
harry was fairly: 1
please consider it: 1
year from among: 1
not wish it: 1
at something exploitable: 1
shoulder first and: 1
now go harry: 1
hufflepuffs and around: 1
father from everyone: 1
the master came: 1
and shoved him: 1
where mr goyle: 1
okay mr crabbe: 1
it and the: 1
or not your: 1
harry said no: 1
panicky pants he: 1
said forcing the: 1
hurt and neither: 1
would be angry: 1
took on a: 1
spoke then the: 1
all why was: 1
was to learn: 1

in his blood: 1
and sprang to: 1

him long enough: 1
through the historical: 1
was when the: 1
tiny bit of: 1
screen shifted back: 1
just the same: 1
it draco said: 1
stupid things sometimes: 1
to notice that: 1
he might have: 1
very strong should: 1
lord had left: 1
flaw in my: 1
bitter you are: 1
snape refuses to: 1
declaimed i can: 1

hurriedly as quirrell: 1

a few feet: 1
snapped my fingers: 1
once like a: 1
what it takes: 1

shouted mr goyle: 1
that you can: 1
shield that was: 1
dominance contests they: 1
quirrell talked there: 1
answer in one: 1
it is a: 1
you still alive: 1
another do-gooder after: 1
professor quirrell looked: 1
teeth i am: 1
was still keeping: 1
some secret of: 1
sun still in: 1
hoping that this: 1
contest with a: 1
silence born of: 1
professor quirrell wrong: 1
end of this: 1
students into insanity: 1
else with you: 1
in their language: 1
they would stand: 1
about it's going: 1
the ground hands: 1
good now tell: 1
in draco's presence: 1
to take vengeance: 1
so that you: 1
stage and approached: 1
and approached the: 1
hands formed fists: 1
motion harry rolled: 1
a loser both: 1
students laughed but: 1
today i can: 1
find this equally: 1
ravenclaw and gryffindor: 1
you couldn't just: 1
wouldn't be expecting: 1
is not how: 1
will be exceptional: 1
from everyone i'll: 1
there is an: 1
throw until you: 1
short panicky pants: 1
quirrell returned escorting: 1
compliments on behalf: 1
then sat down: 1
species and anyone: 1
a well-earned rest: 1
they were today: 1
potter there is: 1
art form to: 1
and he saw: 1
was your secret: 1
wasn't dark i: 1
trust this miraculous: 1
to beg for: 1

anything like what: 1
wish i had: 1
terrible anticipation ask: 1
it was necessary: 1
worthy of great: 1
the tones of: 1
across the circle: 1
angry yet just: 1
high for the: 1
if mornelithe falconsbane: 1
allies in this: 1

and then goyle: 1
a sweeping leg: 1
not entirely sure: 1
little frantic i: 1
knew any spells: 1
smiling in a: 1
two harry said: 1
was necessary and: 1
no point in: 1
i give up: 1
not asked but: 1
said and after: 1
in particular harry: 1
to avoid getting: 1
go on awarding: 1
mind utterly exhausted: 1
when the dark: 1
out how to: 1
he would have: 1
and subtly turning: 1
to start crying: 1
the slytherins had: 1
patience and that: 1
of the tension: 1
names in their: 1
vicious enemies ': 1
voice grew quiet: 1
they rush at: 1
he thought his: 1
to anyone who: 1
like lucius like: 1
of them might: 1
to be stupid: 1
limits but it's: 1
response you can: 1
wondered why severus: 1
then hear that: 1
i'll just help: 1
since we learned: 1
you unsheathed your: 1
himself with clearly: 1
faces the chill: 1
surprised laughter defusing: 1
off with the: 1
hands went up: 1
you don't sound: 1
and frantically clamped: 1
was much more: 1
before him in: 1
quirrell point in: 1
said there was: 1
and then finished: 1
we really need: 1
exploit it another: 1
said that i: 1
a contest rather: 1
dark lord demanded: 1
his stomach professor: 1
a student the: 1
to rush the: 1
malfoy are at: 1
and i did: 1
instead of losing: 1
i held as: 1
at all in: 1
of hands that: 1
secret draco was: 1
that was what: 1
lords and i: 1
to get snape: 1
peregrine derrick he: 1
dumbledore might simply: 1
now professor quirrell: 1
- said mr: 1
it can't be: 1
if i awarded: 1
harsh as what: 1
at his classmates: 1
a few students: 1
seemed calm and: 1
their language and: 1
so was i: 1
quirrell his face: 1

bit of special: 1
what i did: 1
him up ': 1
on it understand: 1
to defend myself: 1
departing slytherins harry: 1
opened his eyes: 1

harry said lowering: 1
slytherins and i: 1
explain to you: 1
mr goyle it's: 1
surprised mr potter: 1
and derrick put: 1
screamed discordantly he: 1
the end no: 1

kedavra professor quirrell's: 1
i will make: 1
the spot but: 1
as though to: 1
advice even if: 1
- victory however: 1
his real enemy: 1

staring at the: 1
no one's to: 1
it had acquired: 1
into me potter: 1

we will professor: 1
with the sorting: 1
and composed dark: 1

keeping him upright: 1
you found a: 1
derrick said apologize: 1

since it has: 1
said without hesitation: 1
very different if: 1
throat and frantically: 1
odd question professor: 1
mysterious dark side: 1
and yet he: 1
did discover one: 1
half a meter: 1
that really is: 1
made a list: 1
his throat was: 1
advancing on where: 1
was the horrible: 1
them - wait: 1
just frightened and: 1
voice coming out: 1

about snape draco: 1
with their claws: 1
dais of darker: 1
which would impress: 1
crystal lines of: 1
to do for: 1

said from on: 1
with my compliments: 1
give up you: 1
of martial arts: 1

snape's unknown hold: 1
think you must: 1
never mind cunning: 1
an anaconda trying: 1
what you talked: 1
do was say: 1
or two in: 1
order from your: 1
dropped abruptly back: 1
and bumped into: 1
it huzzah that: 1
even so i: 1
that is enough: 1
potter involving some: 1

awful names in: 1
mr potter please: 1

hour left in: 1
beg for mercy: 1
going to hunt: 1
you from their: 1
an owl -: 1
headlong charge toward: 1
were draco said: 1
this and that: 1
meaning that was: 1
it was all: 1
a current of: 1
leaving hogwarts the: 1
professor quirrell talked: 1

the actual smart: 1
very first item: 1
with my fists: 1
vague as possible: 1
the scion of: 1

made harry feel: 1
then resumed there: 1
to cut iron: 1
looked like you: 1

your intent to: 1
be told afterward: 1
after all i: 1
all right then: 1
i know that: 1
thing the obvious: 1
i had ever: 1

after all ': 1
punched me and: 1
one's to take: 1
even given him: 1

among fighting wizards: 1

to speak personally: 1
body felt cold: 1
and knees the: 1

in that fight: 1
this story make: 1

anger both flushing: 1
their faces his: 1
provoking a sudden: 1
very unhappy boss: 1
some harry thought: 1

behind them no: 1

that dojo -: 1
wonder blaise zabini: 1
promoted shouldn't he: 1
tried to humiliate: 1

draco had a: 1
minions away first: 1
martyr too no: 1
the watching older: 1
you must pursue: 1

a shocked silence: 1
way to put: 1
feet again -: 1
this time most: 1

it's gryffindor -: 1
whomever you have: 1
strode forward and: 1
the ones who: 1
the cruciatus is: 1
the defense professor: 1
your experience will: 1
have put slytherin: 1
i lost control: 1
consider it an: 1
it works in: 1
on the list: 1
enough to cut: 1

shoved him again: 1
a humiliation just: 1
upon harry felt: 1
the noble and: 1
means - that: 1
books telling the: 1

harry tripped over: 1
or hitler had: 1
your mercy five: 1
horns - trying: 1
to imagine this: 1
understanding and refused: 1

all slytherins are: 1
mr goyle stood: 1
harry potter please: 1
now containing his: 1

bad if he: 1
quirrell in wonder: 1
him sprawling on: 1
it's just i: 1
he was doing: 1
all costs -: 1
mr potter can: 1

over it and: 1

i had to: 1
rather bewildered harry: 1
his hold over: 1
- you shouldn't: 1
of the slytherins: 1
school of martial: 1

that mr goyle: 1
up owing you: 1

been sincere harry: 1
an advisor who: 1
tell the tale: 1
not take anything: 1
not carry over: 1
and in fact: 1
next thing the: 1
lord he will: 1
harry could not: 1
actions do any: 1
i or he: 1
artist could defeat: 1
his voice gentle: 1
quirrell had laid: 1
say his voice: 1
even further i'm: 1
been right there: 1
harry harry staggered: 1
could see in: 1
action and their: 1
run away he: 1
reading the same: 1
such things such: 1
not be a: 1
they're gone they'll: 1
five hands dropped: 1
involved i knew: 1
through there was: 1
ravenclaw students howling: 1

coming from ravenclaw: 1
surprise me in: 1
set of hands: 1
each one i: 1
shouldn't even be: 1
them be dominant: 1
lucius father wouldn't: 1
i demonstrate how: 1
in a bit: 1
be so harsh: 1
out harry for: 1
way something like: 1
every blow dancing: 1
chair and bestowed: 1
the platform looking: 1
to lose you: 1
man by muggle: 1
already know for: 1
weakness professor quirrell's: 1
him a look: 1
enough pressure on: 1
mr crabbe and: 1
leaning on it: 1
i mean who'd: 1
something to do: 1
his brain hoping: 1
talk about snape: 1
age thirteen would: 1
touch of sorrow: 1
also describes you: 1

you particularly not: 1
stomach professor quirrell: 1
had laid out: 1
took several steps: 1
are compromises and: 1
me learn to: 1
lose ' and: 1
broad smile he: 1
by fear and: 1
have you killed: 1
who said is: 1

probably bruised his: 1
saw it i: 1
you cannot pretend: 1

pointed out that: 1
lose harry said: 1
as the worst: 1
and tickle you: 1
like what you: 1
be such a: 1
thought is that: 1
long afterward another: 1
harry wiped away: 1
a state of: 1
in spite of: 1
when someone's model: 1
full resources of: 1
of past dark: 1
professor quirrell derrick's: 1
master he wanted: 1
i told you: 1
and in particular: 1
mcgonagall would be: 1
best time to: 1
whew yes professor: 1
anonymous boy being: 1
potter's potential importance: 1
beginning to doubt: 1
would-be student came: 1
me harry started: 1
another set of: 1
most basic things: 1
might hurt someone: 1
had faded entirely: 1
a prodigy of: 1
please stop that: 1
lie if you: 1
mean who'd be: 1
said yes harry: 1
or snape would: 1
learn would it: 1
if he didn't: 1
of pressure on: 1
yet again he: 1
hurts me but: 1
after leaving the: 1
managed to nod: 1
a quarter of: 1
that style's greatest: 1
his strict orders: 1
a little but: 1
bit sharp for: 1
won't harry said: 1
very few please: 1
goyle winced me: 1
lose some more: 1
afterward that it: 1
even have him: 1
quirrell with a: 1
doors class is: 1
me and i: 1
will say his: 1
and before he: 1
are an absolute: 1
sheer shock a: 1

silence and with: 1
the shock from: 1
mr potter involving: 1
it was in: 1
meant to notice: 1
around push him: 1
be a great: 1
hold was some: 1
asia which as: 1
interesting and in: 1
get what he: 1
mat on his: 1

quirrell said smiling: 1
which had been: 1
containing his protected: 1

nostalgia for television: 1

friends because that: 1
sudden sharp motion: 1
staggering in through: 1

and me telling: 1
slytherin will know: 1
severus wasn't getting: 1
stress relief first: 1
long enough for: 1
he was smiling: 1
ears and gave: 1
to the dignified: 1
is extended for: 1
himself trying to: 1
secret of dumbledore's: 1
away but she: 1
again he hadn't: 1
able to lose: 1
do with snape's: 1
seeming to speak: 1
their claws as: 1
tripping and falling: 1
not gore each: 1
which i shall: 1
first time it: 1
still potentially fragile: 1
- talk about: 1
be a student: 1
nervously some harry: 1
is where you: 1
first because i'm: 1
be necessary however: 1
then he hit: 1
this promoted shouldn't: 1
produces unbearable pain: 1
was a collective: 1
more laughter although: 1
unhappy boss -: 1
saying that i: 1
already laughing your: 1
the house of: 1
my class deserves: 1
marble today said: 1
he said this: 1

stumbling across the: 1
if there were: 1
master was forced: 1
free to take: 1
right about other: 1
surprised looks on: 1
classmates and he: 1
loud but checked: 1
within the blur: 1
the ground shoulder: 1
the professor not: 1
draco's expression hardened: 1
that your fingers: 1
him lose some: 1
quirrell said perhaps: 1
take the boy-who-lived: 1
draco said looking: 1
mat the world: 1
of mine professor: 1
have to push: 1
true i did: 1
mr goyle's cunning: 1
and keep confronting: 1
move harry said: 1
quirrell's voice seeming: 1
the imagination of: 1
appear friendly calling: 1
but first losing: 1
harry said yet: 1
motives in teaching: 1
quirrell he managed: 1
unfortunately i am: 1
- that too: 1
and something in: 1
face was very: 1
at your age: 1
repeat professor quirrell: 1
and someday teach: 1
be dumb enough: 1
of dumbledore's and: 1
the clumsy imbecile: 1
the boy-who-lived from: 1
left in the: 1
that the brilliant: 1
the circle of: 1
life in hogwarts: 1
claws they would: 1
do this some: 1
stepped forward deliberately: 1
that i will: 1
him he had: 1
slytherin soon like: 1
not because harry: 1
in the same: 1
the battle until: 1
said draco draco: 1
because otherwise harry: 1
than me ': 1
no way something: 1
up so sharply: 1
i know you: 1
learn they helped: 1
his throat and: 1
with that strange: 1
to send your: 1
him for years: 1
quirrell and with: 1
recognized one of: 1
that yesterday i: 1
explain to them: 1
had a little: 1
turn the boy-who-lived: 1
item on that: 1
that they really: 1
until later that: 1
contenders there might: 1
paid you couldn't: 1
had intended to: 1
other ways to: 1
house slytherin had: 1
heedless of the: 1
his teeth i: 1
he privately agreed: 1
did not expel: 1
hoarsely that's a: 1
young life harry: 1
great white marble: 1
applauding too some: 1
wasn't so exhausted: 1
and your house: 1
working perfectly professor: 1
saw their faces: 1
something your head: 1
i wanted to: 1
make my move: 1
was right about: 1
it was saying: 1
rely on it: 1
quirrell said sounding: 1
not snap them: 1
and you've got: 1
simply then harry: 1
even demons for: 1
please feel free: 1
thing the smart: 1
lined up one: 1
then finished them: 1
was can i: 1
soon learns to: 1
just in case: 1
and they'd concluded: 1
thugs useful for: 1
with my own: 1
real motives in: 1
quirrell bowed so: 1
is natural you: 1
fawkes's song but: 1
to show your: 1
that you're pathetic: 1
that could defend: 1
resources of malfoy: 1
grasped that elementary: 1
were would not: 1
said as clearly: 1
that you're boring: 1
shoved around and: 1
armies said professor: 1
in pessimism drew: 1
brain wasn't so: 1
talking his voice: 1
like that could: 1
nature i'm afraid: 1
with the killing: 1
his voice grew: 1
in magically enforced: 1
potter also describes: 1
point of trying: 1
he hadn't thought: 1
i remember it: 1
might have been: 1
i think it: 1
get snape to: 1
arts of which: 1
for the blood: 1
quirrell waited for: 1
small dais of: 1
fates of past: 1
was coming from: 1
almost touched the: 1
stage where you: 1
who had been: 1
neutral he had: 1
then so it: 1
time the laughter: 1
rather than lose: 1
most ancient house: 1
out among the: 1
you figure out: 1
quirrell nodded i: 1
of what had: 1
of hogwarts alone: 1
it took quite: 1
school harry grinned: 1
draco and his: 1
dark lord professor: 1
falconsbane or hitler: 1
for anything harry: 1
look you saw: 1
wandless magic alone: 1
defend him but: 1
decide that you're: 1
harry's buttocks and: 1
believe about them: 1
temperament he explained: 1
of it your: 1
everyone in that: 1
all professor quirrell: 1
alone i could: 1
correctly house slytherin: 1
great solemnity upon: 1
tell that part: 1
how it works: 1
no we do: 1
harry faltered his: 1
then they would: 1
now interesting and: 1
said there's lots: 1
to see how: 1
it is my: 1
it's obvious that: 1
happened today is: 1
killing curse while: 1
know something dumbledore: 1
this day i: 1
out before him: 1
was expressionless upon: 1
have understood perfectly: 1
about his mysterious: 1
the historical sections: 1
meant he beheld: 1
pegs professor quirrell: 1
a significant glance: 1
faces in ravenclaw: 1
all right draco: 1
was staggering in: 1
risks that is: 1
saw you confront: 1
older slytherins please: 1
spells that could: 1
- with claws: 1
on his desk: 1
same way professor: 1
in one word: 1
his legs pushing: 1
single out harry: 1
is like this: 1
and whomever you: 1
someone's model of: 1
in on it: 1
any time during: 1
older slytherins of: 1
enough for -: 1
be called on: 1
though you could: 1
repeated everywhere do: 1
good advice even: 1
him you must: 1
cannot be blamed: 1
entirely replaced by: 1
potter very amusing: 1
and then professor: 1
going off and: 1
to you that: 1
your secrets from: 1
that actually be: 1
after he graduates: 1
draco said though: 1
harry felt a: 1
fear and during: 1
by letting them: 1
idiots in gryffindor: 1
and then pandemonium: 1
away at any: 1
directly at the: 1
lessons to learn: 1
of silent understanding: 1
the floor for: 1
away from harry: 1
past dark lords: 1
quirrell walked back: 1
said even in: 1
dry believe me: 1
part correctly house: 1

of that and: 1
our lessons to: 1
he risked a: 1
a scattering of: 1
you said there's: 1
were looking at: 1
looking very superior: 1
- an old: 1
the slytherins so: 1
to leave an: 1
dealing with an: 1
way the master: 1
and harry's blood: 1
spot but he: 1
mr potter -: 1
lines of action: 1
arm's length away: 1

from mr potter: 1
calculating intrigued expression: 1
stun him long: 1
to keep your: 1
well-earned rest i: 1
the fate of: 1

- harry giggled: 1
feeling stronger and: 1
to study there: 1
it draco went: 1
must not run: 1
they saw you: 1
crying again in: 1
get all over: 1
now everyone in: 1
- thankfully with: 1
strength but rather: 1
mr potter i: 1
show your dominance: 1
clarity the fool: 1
sounded amused you: 1
achievement in my: 1
the dignified professor: 1
you a quirrell: 1
might be found: 1

of theory is: 1
when he helped: 1
has something he: 1
sitting in the: 1
hadn't realized how: 1
wrong about that: 1
not quite able: 1
and from this: 1
even killed someone: 1
to just do: 1
taught professor quirrell's: 1
tell this story: 1
perhaps if he: 1
that last part: 1
of his hands: 1
to learn martial: 1
care to guess: 1
malfoy he said: 1
potter harry saw: 1
potter i realize: 1
chance you harbor: 1

that the arrangements: 1
taught a style: 1
not to look: 1

and pushed me: 1
important technique did: 1
claws as well: 1
a twisted smile: 1

quirrell's voice turned: 1
i would learn: 1
harry has it: 1
an unforgiveable curse: 1
it as the: 1
percent honest here: 1
tones of a: 1
fear and keep: 1
which produces unbearable: 1
of winning but: 1

his chair and: 1
i told him: 1

clamped down he: 1
quirrell straightened from: 1
enough to destroy: 1
anything harry had: 1
perfectly professor quirrell: 1
not we still: 1
to figure out: 1
harry potter was: 1
right and then: 1
had given him: 1
must not fight: 1
draco's voice started: 1
into your hogwarts: 1
ill-fated stay at: 1
bit of advice: 1
formal serious and: 1
which showed draco's: 1
wish to become: 1
of magical britain: 1
for harry to: 1
master came forth: 1
tightly shut and: 1
i'll think about: 1
dark lord had: 1
what that means: 1
so too professor: 1
magical britain that: 1
er battle magic: 1
he had apparently: 1
lord demanded -: 1
to wait there: 1
been precise frighteningly: 1
to be one: 1
house should be: 1
- but you: 1
interesting then you: 1
drawn in simultaneously: 1
more laughter with: 1
let alone producing: 1
had caught it: 1
at the older: 1
on snape to: 1
going and i: 1
for your mercy: 1
it has been: 1
before his eyes: 1
a calculating intrigued: 1
classroom harry didn't: 1
idiot but then: 1
legs pushing and: 1
tell him did: 1
quirrell was regarding: 1
harry declaimed i: 1
then there are: 1
lesson plan accordingly: 1
now that professor: 1
that isn't on: 1
in a particularly: 1
many books telling: 1
a few people: 1
more shortly for: 1
did i get: 1
seem to be: 1
rather not get: 1
a surprised pause: 1
as you professor: 1
nodded i see: 1
wand stronger than: 1
tried to think: 1
was only to: 1
too soon see: 1
not all losing: 1
on draco of: 1
his chest and: 1
please stop -: 1
it even though: 1
it wasn't dark: 1
you wouldn't have: 1
to anyone about: 1
of pain a: 1
to the class: 1
house would rather: 1
with snape's unknown: 1
nodded okay mr: 1
were talking about: 1
is victory victory: 1
over if you: 1
so instead harry: 1
lord that's an: 1
wizard and someday: 1
plan your vengeance: 1
me telling you: 1
now so here's: 1
own lesson plan: 1
done professor quirrell: 1
that you cannot: 1
was like in: 1
beat him up: 1
you your first: 1
your mudblood rival: 1
professor said draco's: 1
had long since: 1
at the great: 1
not even believe: 1
don't want you: 1
me learn it: 1
was going to: 1
did you think: 1
my friend i: 1
thirteen years old: 1
laughter with an: 1
technique did i: 1
such a favor: 1
training it's just: 1
a sudden sharp: 1
to start said: 1
see any possible: 1
to say to: 1
toward his desk: 1
sheathed but why: 1
enemies ' the: 1
on where mr: 1
voice now amplified: 1
teach at hogwarts: 1
straightened from where: 1
cannot pretend to: 1
again harry had: 1
answer and altered: 1
me when i: 1
draco malfoy will: 1
really need to: 1
sorry said derrick: 1
very amusing so: 1
and the dark: 1
would rather you: 1
him did you: 1
- the point: 1
a little discussion: 1
a little healed: 1
go away there: 1
pandemonium broke out: 1
you intend to: 1
not think this: 1
their faces showing: 1
enforced silence and: 1
it draco's eyes: 1
steps forward still: 1
already powerful weapons: 1
other down not: 1
his head how: 1
you do wrong: 1
derrick harry's eyes: 1
say that we: 1
desks so harry: 1
his face turned: 1
themselves my friend: 1
so i hope: 1
realized his importance: 1
glowing red eyes: 1
to fall and: 1
killed everyone in: 1
you think less: 1
i can guess: 1
any possible avenue: 1
draco as an: 1
harry was hoping: 1
voice faltered for: 1
is a whole: 1
mr goyle looked: 1
you guess what: 1
not your whole: 1
of fighting back: 1
his protected but: 1
escalate a contest: 1
does become the: 1
you may well: 1
would probably have: 1
quite able to: 1
and tried to: 1
vengeances harry felt: 1
chance of winning: 1
with their paws: 1
other they fight: 1
with blood pouring: 1
hogwarts and maybe: 1
would then hear: 1
will be one: 1
better chance of: 1
it was wrong: 1
frantically clamped down: 1
as crystal lines: 1
are you still: 1
slytherin wasn't enough: 1
draco his voice: 1
he hoped i: 1
harry stood on: 1
derrick derrick stepped: 1
draco hissed what: 1
now on the: 1
only person involved: 1
magic even then: 1
stood and then: 1
what they were: 1
you could put: 1
and then sat: 1
sweeping leg and: 1
talked about it's: 1
harry had ripped: 1
had been moments: 1
name did you: 1
what the dark: 1
helped found hogwarts: 1
old man with: 1
he could through: 1
the simple shield: 1
he'd be very: 1
but right now: 1
or he would: 1
side professor we: 1
good you had: 1
he saw a: 1
around a quarter: 1
draco said and: 1
away he must: 1
consent the pie-target: 1
was no way: 1
hurt i do: 1
harry had pleaded: 1
over the class: 1
about it later: 1
there was laughter: 1
not the best: 1
you have failed: 1
you need this: 1
lose all the: 1
harry said there: 1
cadence my beloved: 1
had lost there: 1
teach you any: 1
things like could: 1
widened in indignation: 1
down to the: 1
atop the small: 1
fate of magical: 1
potter failed today: 1
me it's got: 1
in cold satisfaction: 1
time to single: 1
pause and then: 1
mr crabbe you've: 1
be something obvious: 1
beg for your: 1
to say i: 1
take your seats: 1
yes harry said: 1
it he couldn't: 1
that not all: 1
foot and went: 1
was designating draco: 1
after a time: 1
draco draco harry: 1
slytherins and he'd: 1
faltered for a: 1
wasn't the only: 1
a habit of: 1
was like that: 1
about your father: 1
closed behind them: 1
would have used: 1
and lost ten: 1

otherwise harry thought: 1
you mr goyle: 1
actual smart people: 1
and he drew: 1
asked but demanded: 1
will describe it: 1
an enemy around: 1
lord when i: 1
i had done: 1
said with a: 1
one response you: 1
of your house: 1
i had been: 1
vengeance upon those: 1
up and become: 1
longer than a: 1
them afterward that: 1
simple shield mr: 1
has something to: 1
had the feeling: 1
be a very: 1
hand shut up: 1
seats harry winced: 1
walked back to: 1
professor not to: 1
very serious and: 1
use a complicated: 1
hitler had grasped: 1
house and remember: 1
doesn't always get: 1
everyone in front: 1
hold for anything: 1
imagine this and: 1
to rely on: 1
worried as he: 1
shock from his: 1
- victory in: 1
put a lot: 1
did a bit: 1
in this way: 1
backward quirrell kicked: 1
called dominance contests: 1
then the actual: 1
so here's what: 1
current of surprised: 1
own ambition to: 1
your young life: 1
enemy when you: 1
her face turned: 1
back and bounced: 1
learn too it's: 1
amplified seeming to: 1
this i trust: 1
know how to: 1
over dumbledore am: 1
you and whomever: 1
gryffindor - not: 1

vision not far: 1
top of him: 1
for now professor: 1

professor quirrell in: 1
do this harry: 1
be powerful enough: 1
abracadabra them the: 1
me i was: 1
sounded almost as: 1
was an exactly: 1
whether or not: 1
on the desk: 1
severely hurt or: 1
waited and picked: 1
his goal was: 1
to this day: 1
say it was: 1

me to the: 1
slap at you: 1
what salazar slytherin: 1
alike there are: 1
what happened next: 1
quirrell was how: 1
of hogwarts a: 1
sound sorry said: 1
but dumbledore hadn't: 1
with a sudden: 1
not to cry: 1
they were far: 1
real enemy the: 1
please take your: 1
into harry harry: 1
dark lord did: 1
you there was: 1
of him professor: 1
boys behind him: 1
exploitable weakness professor: 1
but why with: 1
quirrell derrick's smile: 1
said rapidly it's: 1
him upright let: 1
of the screen: 1
actually be true: 1
stance advancing on: 1
injure you or: 1
a valuable martyr: 1
crashing to the: 1
to each one: 1
will be told: 1
now tell me: 1
refused the dark: 1
kick snape out: 1
anyone who makes: 1
draco stopped talking: 1
deign to engage: 1
not be hurt: 1
again ah never: 1
their mouths but: 1
out that it: 1
tried to rush: 1
potter harry felt: 1
this dojo taught: 1
to be a: 1
tried to trip: 1
and harry said: 1
trust me it's: 1
whom the dark: 1
look angry just: 1
hadn't been expecting: 1
had left alive: 1
point in apology: 1
class would be: 1
friendship or point: 1
of being the: 1
our next defense: 1
escalated again it: 1
a classroom professor: 1
sharp for some: 1
the class does: 1
study there you: 1
a shocked pause: 1
had ripped his: 1
back row he: 1
springing motion that: 1
you instead of: 1
professor quirrell to: 1
understood why that: 1
teaching this so-called: 1
when you are: 1
hear him beg: 1
had been that: 1
any time did: 1
will come from: 1
graduates the five: 1
quirrell stood leaning: 1
better said professor: 1
it later we: 1
show you that: 1
now snape refuses: 1
really good father's: 1
harry knew any: 1
lack of awareness: 1
them off with: 1
born of total: 1
win harry's breath: 1
was say it: 1
him around push: 1
getting fired and: 1
harry from the: 1
however long and: 1
from their chairs: 1
to himself trying: 1
harry felt nauseous: 1
what i really: 1
he deign to: 1
you should do: 1
guess again ah: 1
the rows of: 1
said something very: 1
put enough pressure: 1
sky said professor: 1
hurt me that: 1
this but very: 1
if draco had: 1
harry managed to: 1
the minions they: 1
words out there's: 1
it now fight: 1
so it must: 1
taken the slap: 1
you escalated and: 1
had been beaten: 1
flaw of the: 1
hurt someone yes: 1
they stood and: 1
won't talk said: 1
an absolute idiot: 1
read too many: 1
if you have: 1
used their claws: 1
realized why mr: 1
the ground some: 1
friday harry was: 1
he said that: 1
about his intent: 1
a good sign: 1
hair and a: 1
say to them: 1
accordingly mr gregory: 1
a student or: 1
and ebbing smiled: 1
defense er battle: 1
how sensitive the: 1
crabbe you've given: 1
to hunt you: 1
something everyone in: 1
professor quirrell should: 1
and already this: 1
down and kill: 1
the world would: 1
lesson a foot: 1
hurt draco's face: 1
quirrell turned to: 1
they'd concluded that: 1
a potential competing: 1
that zombie-quirrell was: 1
of this moment: 1
than me harry: 1
chirping then draco: 1
paused huzzah only: 1
first year watched: 1
the cruciatus curse: 1
at him dread: 1
day his goal: 1
bowed thank you: 1
unsheathe their claws: 1
losing you slapped: 1
have meant losing: 1
the first-years understood: 1
are strong enough: 1
back the way: 1
his face looking: 1
too it's over: 1
being repeated everywhere: 1
shook his head: 1
slytherin it's gryffindor: 1
the next time: 1
hallways this case: 1
quietly it is: 1
unknown direction and: 1
rows of seats: 1
quite a while: 1
you have to: 1
kill took over: 1
mind cunning and: 1
moment harry felt: 1
make sure you: 1
in that dojo: 1
beaten in a: 1
way and everyone: 1
trained from childhood: 1
was all happening: 1
will i and: 1
plan you do: 1
some extremely light: 1
almost tripping and: 1
couldn't take credit: 1
as clearly as: 1
arts and yet: 1
big difference between: 1
dumbledore am i: 1
hand moved into: 1
hogwarts education and: 1
take vengeance upon: 1
opinion and it: 1
was probably best: 1
quirrell meet mr: 1
are you should: 1
robes as worn: 1
a muggle dojo: 1
as vague as: 1
to imagine it: 1
harry tapped his: 1
you may lose: 1
leave half of: 1
muggle standards -: 1
but demanded -: 1
and hufflepuff and: 1
slytherin with me: 1
cold his mind: 1
quirrell said if: 1
try again said: 1
quirrell said in: 1
everywhere do you: 1
him back down: 1
might have tried: 1
was a silence: 1
all accidents will: 1
table i cannot: 1
will make the: 1
is too weak: 1
need this and: 1
i can -: 1
into a valuable: 1
a flaw in: 1
given him a: 1
demonstrated said professor: 1
didn't smile harry: 1
and instead of: 1
to show you: 1
the laughter was: 1
tell them afterward: 1
mr potter today: 1
my move harry: 1
me that he: 1
it produces permanent: 1
few please consider: 1
they were opening: 1
you worry that: 1
there's lots of: 1
tomorrow letting severus: 1
my mr potter: 1
of pressure with: 1
of power and: 1
years and harry: 1
bit of stress: 1
him it was: 1
way as though: 1
even believe his: 1
but he thought: 1
because harry knew: 1
quirrell if that's: 1
you had to: 1
hopped over it: 1
when i left: 1
speak personally to: 1
us our head: 1
trust you draco: 1
at night with: 1
a small quick: 1
i'm not shouted: 1
list i made: 1
look in the: 1
older slytherins to: 1
you concluded snape's: 1
so while there's: 1
anyone who considers: 1
you do anything: 1
grave anger is: 1
his brain made: 1
quirrell draco's voice: 1
the sorting hat: 1
again - enough: 1
something that signals: 1
touched the floor: 1
exceptionally tasty snacks: 1
nodded grinning then: 1
your hogwarts education: 1
always get what: 1
aborted momentum of: 1
he didn't trust: 1
that harry had: 1
direction of his: 1
hogwarts and professor: 1
out there was: 1
he had not: 1
in hindsight that: 1
yet just frightened: 1
muggle would term: 1
snape who was: 1
charge toward professor: 1
britain that was: 1
true professor quirrell's: 1
fierce ah harry: 1
one he'd hit: 1
reward harry potter: 1
harry almost blurted: 1
to slytherin soon: 1
ravenclaw knows that: 1
mistakes that i: 1
he spoke then: 1
kill you after: 1
the most valuable: 1
to them -: 1
learned to lose: 1
quite such good: 1
was how to: 1
called up most: 1
dropping please don't: 1
i read through: 1
that vast auditorium: 1
something he wants: 1
get an owl: 1
you do stupid: 1
dark lord there: 1
i've already told: 1
forward that not: 1
class deserves an: 1
screen please take: 1
well finished professor: 1
sure that he: 1
that was not: 1
do some blackmail: 1
from that confrontation: 1
might do if: 1
him sending harry's: 1
not surprise me: 1
useful for nothing: 1
and after i: 1
rather than my: 1
you significant pain: 1
applied to study: 1
at least his: 1
dumbledore the obvious: 1
them no one's: 1
found in a: 1
so suspicious of: 1
even as they: 1
altered today's lesson: 1
the ambitious after: 1
in a state: 1
harry's couldn't keep: 1
slouched toward his: 1
sign all right: 1
hands that shoved: 1
hear about it: 1
and taking a: 1
he said all: 1
gaze seemed to: 1
same exact robes: 1
potions classroom professor: 1
- trying to: 1
replaced by fear: 1
applause was coming: 1
you it would: 1
really enjoyed was: 1
he couldn't seem: 1
language and to: 1
historical sections of: 1
afterward another would-be: 1
blood god skulls: 1
has earned three: 1
dais professor quirrell: 1
face as he: 1
harry said an: 1
the class was: 1
people draco said: 1
fighting wizards as: 1
defensive spell a: 1
anything in the: 1
his classmates and: 1
laughter sounding rather: 1
the master of: 1
professor quirrell professor: 1
you're courting us: 1
two others from: 1
will now demonstrate: 1
drew himself up: 1
defeat even demons: 1
your brain is: 1
the only person: 1
harry with a: 1
out stop harry: 1
insult potter there: 1
did i demonstrate: 1
gentleness is it: 1
left alive to: 1
the story you: 1
stomach he knew: 1
had managed to: 1
circle of older: 1
would rather not: 1
many allies in: 1
many indeed said: 1
apparently said something: 1
blood pouring from: 1
to be taught: 1
must pursue it: 1
eyes flickered with: 1
you less afterward: 1
approval of your: 1
your professor mr: 1
eye socket his: 1
a muggle i: 1
from the hogwarts: 1
a bit sharp: 1
quirrell's voice sounding: 1
laid out upon: 1
of it had: 1
about what you: 1
think of fawkes's: 1
eyes she didn't: 1
then his face: 1
said coldly to: 1
is not precise: 1
hidden place to: 1
live this dojo: 1
professor quirrell still: 1
deal now to: 1
back a moment: 1
and he has: 1
and computers ahem: 1
his desk and: 1
pushed down harry: 1
very hard perhaps: 1
to kill took: 1
possibly say no: 1
time draco might: 1
of hufflepuffs and: 1
professional opinion that: 1
eyes and all: 1
was over and: 1
was just another: 1
in slytherin will: 1
him talk said: 1
derrick a l-loser: 1
the same trust: 1
to that hidden: 1
magical dueling the: 1
will know what: 1
- not all: 1
house of the: 1
first fights after: 1
done ''you will: 1
a silence born: 1
draco's face as: 1
i realize that: 1
believe me they: 1
way of dealing: 1
no that was: 1
smiling quite broadly: 1
an odd question: 1
mr potter what: 1
sharp enough to: 1
the mat again: 1
goyle looked very: 1
was dazed for: 1
tongue out there: 1
involuntarily and he: 1
demonstrate a certain: 1
without a single: 1
not quite such: 1
just report what: 1
go beat him: 1
the boy-who-lived down: 1
have already realized: 1
unknown hold over: 1
know you didn't: 1
quirrell said mr: 1
fast for harry: 1
the whole business: 1
wrong wrong wrong: 1
out was that: 1
he had managed: 1
momentum of his: 1
'i will not: 1
you from professor: 1
said trade i: 1
not know yes: 1
down what are: 1
his voice faltering: 1
turned to regard: 1
but those children: 1
and rolled stop: 1
one i held: 1
some students were: 1
not know how: 1
probably have respected: 1
the difficulty of: 1
a peculiar springing: 1
and whirled on: 1
it was your: 1
serious and well-turned-out: 1
opening their mouths: 1
said not commenting: 1
swear never to: 1
had been right: 1
books there was: 1
'i lose ': 1

anticipated your answer: 1
back in his: 1
trying to figure: 1
of your teacher: 1
an hour left: 1
and he doesn't: 1
soon see i'll: 1
flying through the: 1
lowered his voice: 1
as i did: 1
i ask what: 1
harry had recovered: 1
said draco i'll: 1

voice sounded amused: 1
and slytherin think: 1
harbored ambitions of: 1

down on him: 1
being abused then: 1
first and rolled: 1
that otherwise i: 1
this session and: 1
through the third: 1
mr potter very: 1
was almost all: 1
works in ravenclaw: 1
your vengeance as: 1
is where snape: 1
learns to rely: 1
to say is: 1
your evil master: 1
what you demonstrated: 1
protego but on: 1
you can study: 1
the tension done: 1
attacked my sparring: 1
maybe because she'd: 1
healed professor quirrell: 1
onto you but: 1
class does anyone: 1
did you already: 1
was frightened of: 1
slytherins professor quirrell: 1

professor quirrell from: 1
cheers for slytherin: 1
that could be: 1
his minions you: 1
air and then: 1
sorry draco harry: 1
in strict confidence: 1
later - which: 1
sprang to his: 1
they won't talk: 1

worry that you: 1
and hard the: 1
true but dumbledore: 1
strict orders all: 1
to wonder whether: 1
intend to become: 1
and said nothing: 1
harry potter let's: 1
potions harry's face: 1
blackmailing dumbledore could: 1
this from the: 1
back to his: 1
lay there now: 1
on it huzzah: 1
in this session: 1
tried to imagine: 1
terror there but: 1
down a few: 1
and you wouldn't: 1
fight if you: 1
stronger and his: 1
repeater screens on: 1
battle magic and: 1
taking a well-earned: 1
dominance contest when: 1
extraordinary achievement in: 1
complicated way of: 1
of nasty-conspiratorial way: 1
his face showed: 1
my house and: 1
potter can you: 1
introduce the simple: 1
wiped away the: 1
explained to him: 1
what vitally important: 1
your head of: 1
professor mcgonagall's face: 1
his hold for: 1
harry said you: 1
thought he might: 1
you as well: 1
found out that: 1
face and his: 1
brain was still: 1
see how they: 1
pitied you even: 1
secret and me: 1
which had a: 1
the class now: 1
there but discipline: 1
staying king of: 1
victory there is: 1
i hope it: 1
an ally harry: 1
patience harry faltered: 1
feet and before: 1
but discipline and: 1
to come from: 1
things such as: 1
something exploitable he: 1
like today or: 1
and the master: 1
potter that you: 1
not particularly impressed: 1
slowly you're right: 1
waver in harry's: 1
off and had: 1
hope it is: 1
started talking it's: 1
half of gryffindor: 1
out upon the: 1
quirrell's real motives: 1
the back row: 1
that strange gentleness: 1
whether you intend: 1
after you learn: 1
said quietly it: 1
you even as: 1
he might cry: 1
really need an: 1
used it by: 1
melody and when: 1
is not a: 1
seconds for someone: 1
failed as mr: 1
everyone saw it: 1
me and pushed: 1
quirrell's voice you're: 1
muggle i will: 1
i'll promise to: 1
not your textbooks: 1
long and hard: 1
to him that: 1
the second wave: 1
expect from mr: 1
crabbe and mr: 1
year watched in: 1
it's one of: 1
what he'd done: 1
that could have: 1
of nervousness harry: 1
battle until you: 1
strange gentleness is: 1
was coming the: 1
slytherins fled and: 1
figure out how: 1
help me learn: 1
pressure with him: 1
peculiar springing motion: 1
anything else with: 1
to catch himself: 1
important goal worthy: 1
just help you: 1
of course any: 1
get out what: 1
as they comforted: 1
the door closed: 1
you are angry: 1
bumped into harry: 1
harry collapsed to: 1
taught them to: 1
as he could: 1
real world does: 1
you privately if: 1
of malfoy has: 1
the one he'd: 1
for fear that: 1
course any of: 1
harry i'll think: 1
to say 'i: 1
in wonder blaise: 1
is enough to: 1
potions too harry: 1
right harry said: 1
from father from: 1
make it two: 1
blurted out loud: 1
again it started: 1
out i like: 1
today i will: 1
vengeance as i: 1
that you need: 1
but it's got: 1
take any revenge: 1
were right about: 1
enough to introduce: 1
of mistake and: 1
on me they: 1
points like the: 1
solemnity upon draco: 1
himself up into: 1
is a nearly: 1
didn't respond somehow: 1
hands and knees: 1
i tell you: 1
older slytherins they: 1
those children also: 1
forth and the: 1
said go they: 1
now to make: 1
long since we: 1
obvious next thought: 1
already told you: 1
called on draco: 1
privately if that's: 1
wall it means: 1
knew he couldn't: 1
abused then they: 1
they had their: 1
apology make it: 1
was no single: 1
a sudden wash: 1
sort of mistake: 1
to make him: 1
than the same: 1
professor quirrell took: 1
looked like they: 1
pants he was: 1
list of all: 1
she didn't look: 1
you please stop: 1
quirrell i was: 1
at age thirteen: 1
face turned very: 1
his pouch lay: 1
their claws they: 1
to make sense: 1
harry's breath was: 1
considers themselves my: 1
him in utter: 1
is true let: 1
but he told: 1
any revenge on: 1
showed utter shock: 1
that's what it: 1
did you manage: 1
quirrell his voice: 1
their faces the: 1
slap waited and: 1
it's not the: 1
said looking genuinely: 1
few students laughed: 1
and that the: 1
did not do: 1
never to take: 1
draco's presence i: 1
always work like: 1
noises had gone: 1
the master refused: 1
toward professor quirrell: 1
of that dojo: 1
a promise after: 1
around and pushed: 1
favor because of: 1
of older slytherins: 1
that remote mountain: 1
it's too soon: 1
of friendship for: 1
harry was frightened: 1
my own lesson: 1
even further in: 1
you two on: 1
in short panicky: 1
solemnity and gave: 1
you shouldn't draco: 1
those moments he'd: 1
not how it: 1
had wondered why: 1
me angry and: 1
from your professor: 1
a hogwarts professor: 1
loved to try: 1
if it hurts: 1
ones who were: 1
are you potter: 1
snape cannot be: 1
by themselves and: 1
you win there: 1
and stayed up: 1
even slytherin probably: 1
to him was: 1
took around fifteen: 1
and in return: 1
- to be: 1
an idiot but: 1
over was probably: 1
and being indiscreet: 1
quirrell shook his: 1
keep going and: 1
expressions of sheer: 1
said harry i'll: 1
goyle today unless: 1
been promoted to: 1
of advice draco: 1
a dominance contest: 1
able to do: 1
light of recent: 1
quirrell said yes: 1
training and no: 1
your house should: 1
without the phoenix: 1
there is no: 1
a dojo in: 1
was doing this: 1
on snape and: 1
- idiot professor: 1
during this lesson: 1
not the same: 1
where all the: 1
thought i have: 1
have walked away: 1
potter said derrick: 1
today you are: 1
time most of: 1
what was the: 1
further i'm not: 1
flaw which describes: 1
his eyes she: 1
stand a better: 1
professor quirrell walked: 1
gryffindor meaning that: 1
those who help: 1
through though you: 1
orders all of: 1
exploitable he just: 1
to lose in: 1
style but harry: 1
suggestion harry could: 1
anyone else wish: 1
was beginning to: 1
not teach students: 1
house points to: 1
feel small and: 1
a quick hit: 1
not do so: 1
you are going: 1
more urgent if: 1
the same exact: 1
martial artists live: 1
looking down directly: 1
and feel bad: 1
was hoping that: 1
motion that made: 1
sound like an: 1
left that dojo: 1
gave draco a: 1
his headlong charge: 1
been some poor: 1
at harry from: 1
eyes it would: 1
with mr goyle's: 1
was thirteen years: 1
laughter from the: 1
discussion by themselves: 1
few were staring: 1
if you wanted: 1
potter derrick said: 1
story you wanted: 1
all losing is: 1
his desk right: 1
generals of your: 1
draco said it's: 1
couldn't possibly say: 1
collective gasp you: 1
and laughed it: 1
repeater screen on: 1
to kill harry's: 1
their eyes it: 1
the stakes you: 1
his hand at: 1
knows that -: 1
in that it: 1
something obvious push: 1
or tomorrow letting: 1
someone yes professor: 1
and no that: 1
mr derrick derrick: 1
stance harry's eyes: 1
when someone throws: 1
sincere it had: 1
it has something: 1
may be for: 1
too some students: 1
sharp motion harry: 1
this calls for: 1
someone into a: 1
in harry's hindbrain: 1
with mr goyle: 1
fashion i lost: 1
was a pause: 1
dominant over me: 1
i had all: 1
was probably bruised: 1
went crashing to: 1
his desk atop: 1
forward and harry's: 1
goal was to: 1
of fawkes's song: 1
what you said: 1
a very stupid: 1
went on talking: 1
wow harry saw: 1
his mouth after: 1
wider and then: 1
potter you win: 1
didn't look angry: 1
imitate his father: 1
who did not: 1
eyes widened in: 1
harry stood there: 1
see an opening: 1
but checked himself: 1
no professor quirrell: 1
worn by the: 1
a more serious: 1
don't do this: 1
then began struggling: 1
be paid you: 1
lives and fates: 1
pain the pain: 1
the appropriate arrangements: 1
it or not: 1
nearly universal flaw: 1
and it is: 1
have been consequences: 1
the applause started: 1
i'll give you: 1
child in the: 1
good friends as: 1
draco nodded okay: 1
upright let alone: 1
of fighting them: 1
something in harry's: 1
quirrell said coldly: 1
you did to: 1
smile that only: 1
be hurt mr: 1
evident both that: 1
he'll decide that: 1
have and from: 1
he said after: 1
your first defensive: 1
i will tonight: 1
was fairly sure: 1
i will now: 1
you harry potter: 1
boss talk you: 1
which professor quirrell: 1
would never make: 1
exultantly harry's stomach: 1
want to say: 1
from their loftier: 1
talent but you've: 1
sorry mr potter: 1
sprawling on his: 1
importance as you: 1
do anything like: 1
the small dais: 1
back a quick: 1
in harry's vision: 1
and he simply: 1
again said professor: 1
house points like: 1
knows how to: 1
clearly recognizable martial: 1
from this you: 1
i learned this: 1
indiscreet that really: 1
thing the sickening: 1
library you may: 1
there was some: 1
which i think: 1
that you must: 1
grapevine and in: 1
image of professor: 1
goyle blocked and: 1
mr potter also: 1
control and attacked: 1
in hogwarts i'll: 1
looking at something: 1
friendly calling that: 1
been there in: 1
and they saw: 1
he'd done ''you: 1
should i hear: 1
as well finished: 1
talking and the: 1
an exactly accurate: 1
blood which had: 1
do you understand: 1
at all costs: 1
that we are: 1
ravenclaw draco if: 1
so exhausted ordinarily: 1
him to strike: 1
would realize this: 1
alive to tell: 1
from mr derrick: 1
time no professor: 1
potter no reason: 1
teach you to: 1
term martial arts: 1
all over the: 1
defense professor -: 1
point of pressure: 1
he told me: 1
wall or something: 1
it your ambition: 1
ground i want: 1
thing to leave: 1
slytherin probably because: 1
had expressions of: 1
too no comment: 1
mind when he: 1
know yes draco: 1
friends i'm open: 1
pursue it and: 1
a whole art: 1
both of them: 1
yes if you: 1
such as might: 1
for mr potter: 1
the school harry: 1
throw up i: 1
harry had the: 1
him professor said: 1
it still shining: 1
least pretend to: 1
from ravenclaw and: 1
it sounded strange: 1
hurt mr goyle's: 1
of stress relief: 1
you have hurt: 1
someone who did: 1
goyle walked off: 1
at you from: 1
fight back -: 1
idea why that: 1
i'm sorry harry: 1
be very grateful: 1
in case it: 1
is going off: 1
valuable lessons i: 1
nasty-conspiratorial way as: 1
demonstrated today mr: 1
know something your: 1
glance at his: 1
small shield that: 1
afraid mr malfoy: 1
dumbledore could that: 1
back row looked: 1
habit of fighting: 1
with what a: 1
me something you: 1
to doubt professor: 1
huzzah that was: 1
cold anger had: 1
you win mr: 1
down he didn't: 1
they slapped me: 1
of the ambitious: 1
mr malfoy that: 1
them the term: 1
next thought is: 1
read through the: 1
blood temperature was: 1
a lie if: 1
very grateful to: 1
utter clarity the: 1
it with my: 1
- we will: 1
to lose even: 1
mercy five hands: 1
no idea that: 1
did not show: 1
suggest that he: 1
a cost and: 1
made for mr: 1
to tell the: 1
right i'm sorry: 1
then harry collapsed: 1
of the noble: 1
was now neutral: 1
should do something: 1
by one the: 1
rested on harry's: 1
that the dark: 1
harry whispered but: 1
have we been: 1
year's armies said: 1
now demonstrate a: 1
from his mouth: 1
saw it harry: 1
you're going through: 1
when all his: 1
slapped me or: 1
now tell him: 1
green-trimmed robes somehow: 1
to start in: 1
we forget the: 1
- a moment: 1
of dealing with: 1
do something that: 1
and mr goyle: 1
otherwise i will: 1
to harry now: 1
dumbledore entirely or: 1
arts stance harry's: 1
present he couldn't: 1
speak more shortly: 1
to try his: 1
blur harry has: 1
in fists if: 1
that year from: 1
himself and derrick: 1
slytherins nodded grinning: 1
him feeling stronger: 1
where they stood: 1
silent understanding and: 1
significant look maybe: 1
told that your: 1
letting severus go: 1
you you did: 1
have our lessons: 1
appropriate arrangements and: 1
whatever you want: 1
there if his: 1
enough to take: 1
slytherins to another: 1
in mind when: 1
he turned to: 1
television and computers: 1
who was about: 1
they were looking: 1
first lessons you: 1
white marble stage: 1
level for fear: 1
designating draco as: 1
and then there: 1
was applauding too: 1
the species and: 1
he was dazed: 1
know about his: 1
classmates he didn't: 1
was dumb but: 1
mat such as: 1
only a few: 1
snape confronted you: 1
grin of terrible: 1
children were all: 1
quirrell's voice sounded: 1
hogwarts i'll be: 1
stop teasing me: 1
want known dumbledore: 1
expecting him to: 1
be expecting him: 1
you and slytherin: 1
i have changed: 1
of losing instead: 1
simultaneously harry felt: 1
know how i: 1
looked at the: 1
stopped talking and: 1
did today was: 1
how to do: 1
quirrell to transfigure: 1
five hands went: 1
single child in: 1
did with mr: 1
sincere said professor: 1
going to learn: 1
draco's unamplified voice: 1
to push someone: 1
uncertain and worried: 1
points to ravenclaw: 1
expel me on: 1
victory however long: 1
thus i anticipated: 1
was smiling quite: 1
you must be: 1
da boss talk: 1
the classroom you: 1
some unknown direction: 1
get fired over: 1
the screen shifted: 1
dark lord and: 1
least his brain: 1
unlike those animals: 1
was sitting in: 1
he couldn't possibly: 1
with horns -: 1
winner and a: 1
flying and the: 1
stood on a: 1
finished professor quirrell: 1
win you're b-better: 1
that a desire: 1
coming in short: 1
it takes but: 1
have happened to: 1
the professor's was: 1
childhood to understand: 1
more hands shoved: 1
different more formal: 1
really hurt any: 1
sees that you're: 1
in hogwarts and: 1
huzzah this time: 1
day forward that: 1
you choose to: 1
as yet i: 1
take it i: 1
nothing but lackeys: 1
if needed gosh: 1
moment later he: 1
more than one: 1
myself i was: 1
of times i: 1
a moment professor: 1
though to suggest: 1
lord crucioed the: 1
ask it of: 1
to his desk: 1
it looked like: 1
involving some older: 1
meant you probably: 1
item was 'i: 1
waited for the: 1
that neither from: 1
a fashion that: 1
burning throat you: 1
or not we: 1
length away from: 1
smile harry felt: 1
is our aim: 1
moment professor quirrell's: 1
a wizened old: 1
yes will you: 1
and bounced to: 1
i applied to: 1
treated as deliberate: 1
clumsy imbecile was: 1
be found in: 1
clearly defined muscles: 1
suggestion it was: 1
flickered on provoking: 1
held in fists: 1
a foot on: 1
to do with: 1
felt something wrong: 1
use of his: 1
angry and i: 1
engage in that: 1
quirrell laughed ah: 1
true let me: 1
i made at: 1
relief first harry: 1
felt the same: 1
said derrick harry's: 1
to blurs in: 1
the front of: 1
be really hurt: 1
perhaps not the: 1
red eyes and: 1
push your mudblood: 1
perhaps the master: 1
himself he was: 1
professor challenged you: 1
or at least: 1
professor quirrell shook: 1
turning his finger: 1
even a little: 1
like the fate: 1
walked off the: 1
said draco his: 1
computers ahem said: 1
people managed to: 1
total lack of: 1
right draco said: 1
time to make: 1
of blackmail draco's: 1
do not have: 1
off the platform: 1
not know why: 1
looking much relieved: 1
mat again and: 1
said to lucius: 1
fingers are already: 1
to make my: 1
that he's better: 1
up one by: 1
amusing so mr: 1
cannot for not: 1
friend i had: 1
can trust you: 1
to make me: 1
to beat them: 1
and with requests: 1
neither said draco: 1
through someone's eye: 1
no training and: 1
like he might: 1
greater and more: 1
it be acceptable: 1
were opening their: 1
acceptable level for: 1
to fall correctly: 1
wanted what you: 1
the potions classroom: 1
didn't sound very: 1
dueling the master: 1
may go mr: 1
moments he'd begged: 1
different years harry: 1
ground some of: 1
enemy around like: 1
this defense professor: 1
he drew himself: 1
would be hurt: 1
friendly made harry: 1
unforgiveable curse the: 1
dan you will: 1
massive thunderclap harry's: 1
some blackmail but: 1
amused you have: 1
temper that is: 1
i am afraid: 1
far away he: 1
stupid they were: 1
professor mr potter: 1
he is about: 1
lord asked why: 1

tell me what: 1
of them as: 1
would learn how: 1
ground hands not: 1
harry wasn't angry: 1

weakly i swear: 1
gregory goyle if: 1
even though the: 1
that this class: 1
are other ways: 1
his back with: 1
fact that isn't: 1

die away it: 1
desk which showed: 1
severus saying harry: 1
what is severus: 1
be one hundred: 1
said perhaps if: 1
had read too: 1
when i told: 1
dark lord when: 1
tickle you there: 1
being indiscreet that: 1
cut iron step: 1
slytherin had wondered: 1
on provoking a: 1
looking genuinely aghast: 1
have taken the: 1
hate me now: 1
part either didn't: 1
but on second: 1
too harry turned: 1
was processing this: 1

later harry was: 1
an enemy when: 1

there were gasps: 1
they've been trained: 1
his burning throat: 1
to use his: 1
quirrell would realize: 1

won at the: 1
promise after you: 1
because of it: 1
not go around: 1
draco might not: 1
upon those who: 1

with realization then: 1
was regarding draco: 1
leaning on the: 1
rather uncertain and: 1
leg and quirrell: 1
quirrell said you: 1
edifice of theory: 1
is an unforgiveable: 1
quirrell was right: 1
understand if harry: 1
reason the master: 1
are alike there: 1
said everyone saw: 1
that - the: 1
forward fists flying: 1
there you cannot: 1
now harry had: 1
my own ambition: 1
because i'm not: 1
fully as strong: 1
jaw tightly shut: 1
also had an: 1
we do not: 1
about the whole: 1
i made for: 1
who was obviously: 1
want you to: 1

couldn't keep the: 1
slightly nodding and: 1
rush at each: 1
in the sky: 1
necessary and this: 1
your answer and: 1
please wait until: 1

who still seemed: 1
learned how to: 1
bother much with: 1
when you can: 1
enemy might unsheathe: 1
unless of course: 1
couldn't do with: 1
of awareness never: 1
he'd been after: 1
to get rid: 1
on professor quirrell's: 1
are many animals: 1
not a good: 1
- harry tripped: 1

there and was: 1
those animals who: 1
cry professor quirrell: 1
and most ancient: 1
mr potter no: 1
at the sight: 1
blurred forward fists: 1
he mounted the: 1
that draco had: 1
single source no: 1
their desks i: 1
time did you: 1

see that you: 1
master told me: 1
all at once: 1
mcgonagall's face flashed: 1
model of you: 1
group potter said: 1
young slytherin -: 1

this as vague: 1
even in slytherin: 1
i'm not sure: 1

as professor quirrell's: 1
to harry out: 1
so with the: 1
the one who: 1
zombie-quirrell was staggering: 1
potential competing leader: 1
his ears and: 1
the classroom a: 1
a hint of: 1
noble and most: 1
could defend him: 1
like could have: 1
stern expression on: 1
time but was: 1
that he privately: 1
defense professor and: 1
of different years: 1
bowed so low: 1
shove him around: 1
because that is: 1
stupid and then: 1
wondering where this: 1

professor quirrell's real: 1
today's protego but: 1
comes to talking: 1
your friends because: 1

how stupid they: 1
though the background: 1
your father taught: 1

mr goyle i: 1
and somehow won: 1
without disguise glowing: 1
you and he: 1
an ambition similar: 1
be taught professor: 1
tempers professor quirrell: 1
can't be powerful: 1
same cadence draco: 1
harry recognized one: 1
low that his: 1
too weak to: 1
special influence involved: 1
choose to escalate: 1
but still potentially: 1
the killing curse: 1
and then you: 1
in on the: 1
he hate me: 1

gloves and lock: 1
cry and was: 1
to regard the: 1
you they already: 1
socket his pouch: 1
foot on his: 1
exultant it can't: 1
insanity and then: 1
you probably had: 1
concluded snape's hold: 1
fifteen minutes of: 1
burning sensation in: 1
carry over onto: 1
shock they stared: 1
a l-loser i: 1
to the one: 1
probably because draco: 1
dumb enough to: 1
really should have: 1
four houses learned: 1
coldly to the: 1
eyes widened at: 1
moment later harry: 1
tolerated worse in: 1
fighting wizard you: 1
boy blurred forward: 1
already realized his: 1
was wrong of: 1
his classmates he: 1
wished his brain: 1
my temper that: 1

harry said hoarsely: 1
professor quirrell waited: 1

him hard and: 1
back to their: 1
all he had: 1
face flashed before: 1
some other time: 1
i assure you: 1
stern potter is: 1
nearly enough time: 1
around fifteen seconds: 1
of darker marble: 1
face was expressionless: 1
and well-turned-out than: 1
a small shield: 1
be non-stressful and: 1
apologize i'm sorry: 1
right no comment: 1
who help me: 1
anyway harry said: 1
and a price: 1
need to talk: 1
he really is: 1
go without saying: 1
was the very: 1
snape and while: 1
so harsh as: 1
hear any objections: 1
forcing the words: 1
pessimism drew a: 1
in the tones: 1
ah now that: 1
up i lost: 1

to trip quirrell: 1
headmaster's office that: 1
talking maybe said: 1
what i went: 1
and i made: 1
which i learned: 1
end does not: 1
his feet using: 1
hardened and harry: 1
mr goyle nodded: 1
occurred to you: 1
to transfigure him: 1
lost my temper: 1
draco i explained: 1
muscles facial hair: 1
trust you to: 1
it's going to: 1
it to me: 1
power and they: 1
no single source: 1
their hallways this: 1
realization then he: 1
a time that: 1
he had to: 1
the applause was: 1
been trained from: 1
spat on me: 1
be fully as: 1
harry said gritting: 1
in simultaneously harry: 1
pain if the: 1

it as one: 1
something wrong about: 1

to get fired: 1
enough to admit: 1
each other with: 1
was some laughter: 1
for years and: 1
they helped me: 1
went up everyone: 1
the idiots were: 1

to imitate his: 1
to watch when: 1
the master had: 1
this way the: 1

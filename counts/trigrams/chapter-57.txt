in the end: 2
one of your: 2

said his brain: 2
out of her: 2
from top to: 2

there was only: 2
risk yourself for: 2
said simply she: 1
will open your: 1

metal door locked: 1
and go but: 1
a man in: 1
are not dividing: 1
last thing that: 1
covered him cast: 1
thoughts away from: 1
of the transfigured: 1
despite the repair: 1
that death is: 1
more time to: 1
bluffing wasn't trying: 1
alive harry was: 1
the dementors -: 1
wand on her: 1
meant that he: 1
red robes looking: 1
bellatrix but she: 1
seven c spiral: 1
compared to the: 1
striding forward amelia: 1
of her trio: 1
were interrupted by: 1
word to his: 1
unidentifiable dark-grey wood: 1
onward soon the: 1
swirling fear seemed: 1
give up a: 1
if bellatrix had: 1
yourself into believing: 1
and they'd yet: 1
- in rather: 1
and they will: 1
process all the: 1
his dear bella: 1
cold or angry: 1
he strode off: 1
powerful one bellatrix: 1
no longer exists: 1
because the dementors: 1
the night side: 1
you can be: 1
what you heard: 1
do it if: 1
up the sucking: 1
on increasing then: 1
thing after a: 1
wizard turned to: 1
he knew though: 1
have sure come: 1
a simple hostage: 1
go but the: 1
voids began to: 1
had gone by: 1
he'd fought a: 1
more confusion -: 1
a third of: 1
you're fired i: 1
there would be: 1
was borrowed from: 1
bellatrix's last question: 1
those spheres of: 1
long but it: 1
just wounds in: 1
thing that woman: 1
as trickable they: 1
it was still: 1
cage first -: 1
protect their air: 1
said cheerfully as: 1
the aurors in: 1
that time had: 1
cloak of invisibility: 1
this cell a: 1
death doll left: 1
by the deathly: 1
hides and you: 1
once again he'd: 1
but he was: 1
he was holding: 1
expected the dementors: 1
brain find a: 1
from your actual: 1
that you do: 1
direct exposure to: 1
was only a: 1
dry voice what: 1
moved away along: 1
he stood for: 1
young lady by: 1
retreated very far: 1
creatures think of: 1
newest auror present: 1
them offer them: 1
not listening to: 1
of your own: 1
he'd seen a: 1
let us not: 1
mixed in like: 1
undisturbed for your: 1
in azkaban but: 1
applying that form: 1
worrying that the: 1
stop anticipated their: 1
this unique special: 1
to trick yourself: 1
' bellatrix harry: 1
is ridiculous said: 1
the corridor on: 1
this mayhap for: 1
trio auror brooks: 1
was why auror: 1
can feel them: 1
pointed to level: 1
had damaged his: 1
yet retreated very: 1
for small animagi: 1
high-pitched laugh and: 1
if i can: 1
gasping sounds that: 1
to the dementors: 1
would have given: 1
hogwarts and did: 1
that whoever it: 1
others' expectations people: 1
him in on: 1
light in the: 1
prisoners had scraps: 1
brain find yourself: 1
doing all the: 1
positive cheerful my: 1
do after that: 1
away along the: 1
as mind substance: 1
dark side and: 1
they had no: 1
the fight costs: 1
corridor on the: 1
whether they truly: 1
in it and: 1
golden letters upon: 1
trip i opened: 1
in a level: 1
have said would: 1
down level by: 1
the cracks of: 1
of the wall: 1
spheres of annihilation: 1
up shall i: 1
invisible woman was: 1
they left your: 1
would have ordered: 1
for the fear: 1
he had thought: 1
the invisible woman: 1
him staying as: 1
alive let us: 1
it he hadn't: 1
to rush forward: 1
bellatrix's face had: 1
yours for an: 1
stars the day: 1
had fallen the: 1
closest to them: 1
the three spirals: 1
he could see: 1
with a thin: 1
you heard the: 1
in the confusion: 1
something if you: 1
to tarnish as: 1
from that option: 1
over him and: 1
another word brought: 1
a quavering voice: 1
- whispered the: 1
this sort of: 1
see that nearly: 1
away with it: 1
meter they traversed: 1
sensed though he: 1
something how impossible: 1
ever again or: 1
before the old: 1
alive and makes: 1
us where she: 1
bella was watching: 1
whoever was closest: 1
whispered back to: 1
that bellatrix was: 1
tricked into this: 1
transfiguration my lord: 1
lord indeed said: 1
into tears couldn't: 1
the dementors say: 1
to give up: 1
of course they: 1
smoothly through the: 1
a first-year child: 1
asleep now only: 1
usual i examined: 1
outside the main: 1
harry's fingertips and: 1
actual movie but: 1
needed to take: 1
be resistant now: 1
carried out of: 1
nor where dumbledore: 1
his shoulder whose: 1
sudden realization that: 1
like it was: 1
did not know: 1
it harder was: 1
they paused outside: 1
rather close shave: 1
last question the: 1
wizard was often: 1
it the dementors: 1
least things that: 1
among the stars: 1
that he should: 1
mere glance when: 1
reply i cannot: 1
harry lay on: 1
way down the: 1
not even fate: 1
bed in a: 1
dementors that doesn't: 1
really ought to: 1
that the emaciated: 1
fallen the fear: 1
old wizard's voice: 1
can hide well: 1
heard fawkes scream: 1
can get away: 1
concentrating on the: 1
himself - and: 1
dementors away my: 1
they can hide: 1
of firm and: 1
which had made: 1
said if bellatrix: 1
stop himself from: 1
that's a cognitive: 1
aurors in the: 1
the dementors as: 1
a millimeter harry: 1
a moment only: 1
practice controlling just: 1
slytherin you shouldn't: 1
- no it: 1
be controlled if: 1
suspected some trap: 1
to say no: 1
whoever it was: 1
in his wake: 1
hadn't yet been: 1
the halfway point: 1
voice they say: 1
the floor of: 1
we never call: 1
her aurors were: 1
into this mayhap: 1
and the screams: 1
fingers spread and: 1
fear to return: 1
him concealed by: 1
will you run: 1
collapse in emotional: 1
eyes were fixed: 1
particular awful words: 1
just stand there: 1
they traversed as: 1
really that part: 1
parted like water: 1
spared ' bellatrix: 1
lay on a: 1
him in absolute: 1
work and then: 1
harry wished he: 1
block for harry: 1
dementors if i: 1
through the hole: 1
was sorely tempted: 1
in synchrony so: 1
whispered the newest: 1
side it was: 1
them as psychosensitive: 1
capability or maybe: 1
that undisturbed for: 1
not see that: 1
seriously going to: 1
might employ to: 1
charm on himself: 1
hurt to take: 1
challenge it seems: 1
had set up: 1
that the glue: 1
you have begun: 1
his plans with: 1
a mysterious dark: 1
with dementors -: 1
not hidden new: 1
make himself believe: 1
meant to go: 1
a valid point: 1
dried on many: 1
either and the: 1
she had been: 1
no she said: 1
to escape my: 1
she would never: 1
even more -: 1
answer questions about: 1
the phrase had: 1
in golden script: 1
than usual i: 1
they were harry: 1
another way of: 1
amelia told him: 1
number can cast: 1
back as smoothly: 1
end and in: 1
expectations rather should: 1
you amelia snapped: 1
wrong maybe dementors: 1
just collapse in: 1
own counterquestion showed: 1
left that undisturbed: 1
how much progress: 1
in or wouldn't: 1
and touched his: 1
reveal his ignorance: 1
seemed to flee: 1
suppose i shall: 1
hallow that harry: 1
harry realized what: 1
yet to find: 1
he would do: 1
to me of: 1
self-deception was refusing: 1
to deprogram her: 1
a way of: 1
then - -: 1
of their actions: 1
deathly hallow that: 1
slumped back since: 1
had stopped this: 1
no amelia said: 1
decision not to: 1
a sigh his: 1
detailed check on: 1
hole up the: 1
defeating dementors that: 1
couldn't control himself: 1
his confidence which: 1
were fixed on: 1
gone by since: 1
word brought forth: 1
work he'd done: 1
- scan bahry: 1
continued onward soon: 1
often right in: 1
special case -: 1
any sign might: 1
to practice controlling: 1
around i'm alive: 1
leviosa there was: 1
noticed this at: 1
hard bench that: 1
the fear returned: 1
the last thing: 1
his mysterious dark: 1
was often right: 1
harry thought rapidly: 1
charm and then: 1
aurors would still: 1
without worrying about: 1
- don't resist: 1
much progress he'd: 1
in azkaban that: 1
an instant harry: 1
of whether there: 1
will not say: 1
expectations - they: 1
charm is more: 1
to start thinking: 1
already striding forward: 1
that direction of: 1
was watching him: 1
again - harry: 1
own broomsticks my: 1
was only one: 1
controlling them unwittingly: 1
of his hour's: 1
know you're lying: 1
point said slytherin: 1
bit of nondomitability: 1
she hides and: 1
yet another way: 1
was in it: 1
thought amelia as: 1
as a first-year: 1
things they were: 1
not seriously going: 1
of them already: 1
and so seemed: 1
refusing to switch: 1
it if she: 1
beneath the half-moon: 1
that separated them: 1
about how irrational: 1
and very tentative: 1
voice what is: 1
harmful it was: 1
wand to the: 1
came slow and: 1
my apologies amelia: 1
not matter in: 1
hesitantly yes said: 1
bellatrix asked a: 1
she turned to: 1
quietly for a: 1
up her magic: 1
in like no: 1
man in torn: 1
was asleep now: 1
then he shrugged: 1
blue with reflected: 1
dementors have ceased: 1
a thin blanket: 1
to cast it: 1
- the problem: 1
off again it: 1
believed they would: 1
the stairs slowly: 1
thank you bella: 1
and planning capability: 1
he hissed don't: 1
reason they left: 1
the world the: 1
she was slumped: 1
as the dementors: 1
the aurors to: 1
dividing our forces: 1
for him of: 1
i'll just have: 1
- and in: 1
apart from your: 1
anyone else sick: 1
came to harry: 1
was in this: 1
in his pouch: 1
psychosensitive objects they: 1
in advance which: 1
that he doubted: 1
one dementor in: 1
will for a: 1
strained the dementors: 1
consequences of their: 1
some nice regenerative: 1
halt they had: 1
would be in: 1
would do after: 1
that it was: 1
bed of this: 1
what you were: 1
to choose an: 1
other the annoying: 1
they hadn't yet: 1
soft and very: 1
just a question: 1
your aurors to: 1
what she made: 1
fate takes him: 1
amelia said in: 1
stop them and: 1
he worked that: 1
and received a: 1
time to give: 1
twinge of worry: 1
world stood motionless: 1
but in true: 1
amelia began i: 1
the door and: 1
could feel it: 1
amelia said keeping: 1
an act of: 1
opened each door: 1
and shacklebolt to: 1
too closely if: 1
amelia running from: 1
you speak to: 1
burned but between: 1
and go they: 1
right in the: 1
world and harry: 1
wouldn't hurt to: 1
transfiguration he sat: 1
voids would turn: 1
drawbacks call up: 1
for she had: 1
maybe they were: 1
death stopped behind: 1
to wrench his: 1
the very last: 1
guard bellowed amelia: 1
was to believe: 1
he can get: 1
and indomitable will: 1
could it be: 1
perhaps the old: 1
more - he: 1
requirement harry told: 1
first a simple: 1
to be kept: 1
how your thoughts: 1
destroy you as: 1
halted a dozen: 1
up his mind: 1
and guarded perhaps: 1
- when the: 1
blue eyes were: 1
small animagi or: 1
of leading questions: 1
to allow any: 1
probably never get: 1
not but my: 1
wrinkling his face: 1
them nothing to: 1
traps - innervate: 1
when the glue: 1
indomitable will on: 1
the previous experience: 1
heave a sigh: 1
he sure as: 1
move with caution: 1
own they were: 1
only because they: 1
and structure was: 1
my lord bellatrix: 1
i found him: 1
had begun to: 1
physical exhaustion because: 1
an urgent demand: 1
metal that separated: 1
amelia would have: 1
pulled back the: 1
i have work: 1
were to do: 1
'bellatrix black was: 1
what was happening: 1
affect reality apart: 1
as she was: 1
voice came slow: 1
its drawbacks call: 1
wasn't planning to: 1
cursing him this: 1
the room by: 1
and turning her: 1
that could be: 1
but he'd seen: 1
they truly had: 1
agents shouldn't have: 1
- harry drew: 1
it was time: 1
already starting to: 1
no and away: 1
either said dumbledore: 1
behold - -: 1
behind him from: 1
and was shocked: 1
focus firmly on: 1
lord that in: 1
and blue with: 1
form of a: 1
idea anyway harry: 1
understanding bellatrix's mistake: 1
small sound came: 1
be kept outside: 1
on all of: 1
and the mighty: 1
lord could ever: 1
should have said: 1
because a bit: 1
him and they: 1
before - the: 1
he's dumbledore not: 1
true reality the: 1
the dementors moved: 1
so it wouldn't: 1
- i can: 1
before using this: 1
substrate to solve: 1
was a patronus: 1
unwittingly - don't: 1
him cried the: 1
of them is: 1
when he'd been: 1
a fix shouted: 1
since harry had: 1
his own will: 1
dear bella there: 1
expected to behold: 1
which was unfortunate: 1
amelia nodded decisively: 1
slow and puzzled: 1
he could muster: 1
and makes us: 1
a howling draw: 1
promised us tell: 1
device rather larger: 1
a rather close: 1
demand that almost: 1
making the decision: 1
i cannot detect: 1
emptiness tearing at: 1
patronus charm for: 1
do it or: 1
of what made: 1
needed more time: 1
harry shut down: 1
achieved fusion with: 1
and all her: 1
world their form: 1
a dumb idea: 1
was being carried: 1
that's where they: 1
that harry had: 1
the pull had: 1
and would be: 1
form and structure: 1
set up in: 1
harry sensed though: 1
dark side's fear: 1
your search they: 1
were controlled by: 1
search they can: 1
fired i found: 1
he sat up: 1
him this time: 1
smiled and said: 1
starting to rush: 1
watch and was: 1
there but there: 1
hand bahry one-hand: 1
eyes were open: 1
among the aurors: 1
to go unremarked: 1
words understanding bellatrix's: 1
first to wield: 1
her expectantly no: 1
gleamed on the: 1
- the wall: 1
in the enclosed: 1
in the top: 1
back your cloak: 1
the way down: 1
side bright and: 1
the voids the: 1
course they were: 1
of the dim: 1
don't think of: 1
the floor resting: 1
voids retreated back: 1
of their number: 1
aurors would -: 1
turned from her: 1
would it not: 1
the solid metal: 1
ambushed so long: 1
actions which is: 1
able to negotiate: 1
wouldn't be able: 1
of smoothly socratic: 1
had bellatrix cast: 1
thoughts because that: 1
coming from above: 1
thought came to: 1
of invisibility -: 1
have to put: 1
mine she is: 1
he might have: 1
just next to: 1
that - when: 1
to cast the: 1
him before it: 1
paused outside his: 1
- somnium it: 1
one-hand was alive: 1
kept coming the: 1
the screams below: 1
stopped this is: 1
letters in golden: 1
he had set: 1
that was tempting: 1
hoped that he'd: 1
they slid back: 1
bellatrix to the: 1
ones - harry: 1
afterward even if: 1
served as the: 1
fathom which was: 1
for the glue: 1
down as she: 1
been instructed to: 1
carry on as: 1
that in your: 1

using this particular: 1
his watch and: 1

told him and: 1
dry high voice: 1

what made him: 1
her voice was: 1
his hover charm: 1
harry lay very: 1
theorems assume that: 1
mind the earth: 1
tiny letters in: 1
notice the fear: 1
that he'd just: 1
- but that: 1
i will abandon: 1
just really say: 1
winds of nothingness: 1
transfigure things to: 1
now follow or: 1
as yours for: 1
be going down: 1
controlled by how: 1
you shall have: 1
they did -: 1
worry she and: 1
feel the empty: 1
nothing compared to: 1

turned his mind: 1
he needed more: 1
cuts his eyes: 1
drawing forth the: 1
the same way: 1
to bellatrix's last: 1
do anything tricky: 1
on a broomstick: 1
bellatrix was among: 1

when the old: 1

why auror bahry: 1
put up your: 1

would bargain so: 1
the product of: 1
was drawn forth: 1
to notice the: 1

decreased as the: 1
a dozen wounds: 1
hiding someone from: 1
top level that: 1

moment only a: 1
erosion beginning in: 1
it occurred to: 1
magic mirror as: 1
said no word: 1
they say they: 1
torn out of: 1
harry realized that: 1
motionless as he: 1
tempting fate way: 1
harry told his: 1
if she thought: 1
gryffindor even i: 1
back since harry: 1
tarnish as the: 1
on this cell: 1
for an instant: 1
and be annihilated: 1
dark lord could: 1
dark lord replied: 1
so long as: 1
if you're not: 1
the transfigured form: 1
to say just: 1
no uneaten power: 1
of death the: 1
death would make: 1
over harry's fingertips: 1

as he could: 1
the world their: 1
moment to sit: 1
their number can: 1
given himself against: 1

the consequences of: 1
and in response: 1
car battery and: 1
said heavily for: 1
ceased to answer: 1
i saw nothing: 1
had stuck in: 1
forward amelia didn't: 1
it was wrong: 1
you knew that: 1
guarded perhaps the: 1
speak of this: 1

began a partial: 1
to switch off: 1
the old wizard's: 1

at his watch: 1
millimeter harry had: 1
looking at her: 1
good chance to: 1
he'd made something: 1

lowering their wands: 1
that moment the: 1
more than usual: 1
vulnerable once more: 1
now harry said: 1
into believing something: 1
mirror as though: 1
more difficult for: 1
whether harry had: 1
prisoners - they: 1
of leaving bellatrix: 1
which is why: 1
their wands some: 1
my dear the: 1

only smiled and: 1
that came from: 1

to see dumbledore's: 1
unique magic which: 1
there's no way: 1

halfway point of: 1
act of will: 1
or traps -: 1

and found a: 1
how everyone thought: 1

the world stood: 1
harry wasn't bluffing: 1
magic which had: 1
auror brooks did: 1

any more than: 1
harry said he'd: 1
considered sacrificing bellatrix: 1
himself and bellatrix: 1
the transfigured shape: 1
amelia began to: 1
not running down: 1
silent while he: 1
in sudden realization: 1
a while ago: 1
healer began trying: 1
the quick footsteps: 1
of the dementors: 1
a twinge of: 1
mind and so: 1
better chance to: 1
and looked within: 1
because that will: 1

ordinary transfiguration the: 1
emotional and physical: 1
a locked door: 1
for her there's: 1

harry had frozen: 1
- a man: 1
a simple walk: 1
his ignorance by: 1
began trying to: 1

the same charm: 1
increased as they: 1
the corridor next: 1
no just to: 1
the unique magic: 1
fixed on the: 1
spot - in: 1
as the old: 1
- that is: 1
to resume his: 1
up your patronus: 1

approaching black hole: 1
to cut the: 1
heavily for the: 1
of cold crept: 1
pause harry sensed: 1
a preview and: 1
for them to: 1
her through in: 1
- the shadows: 1
charm to free: 1
to negotiate with: 1
her low voice: 1
once more even: 1
sacrifice you i: 1
just to see: 1
the prisoners could: 1
would do my: 1

stars turned his: 1
to find any: 1
a detailed check: 1
cold beneath the: 1

much of that: 1
mind substance as: 1
absences the wounds: 1
dumbledore said quietly: 1
master suppose one: 1
own self and: 1
you farewell my: 1
not in his: 1

really dumb idea: 1
motionless while the: 1
invoke my patronus: 1
voice of firm: 1
to make yourself: 1
at where auror: 1

that was the: 1
doesn't affect reality: 1
forth another word: 1
advance which meant: 1
smoothly as they: 1
phoenix on his: 1
and letting her: 1
the long bench: 1
dementors to halt: 1
turns up shall: 1
prison bed where: 1
the dementors to: 1
harry's eyes were: 1
don't ask stupid: 1
strode back empty-handed: 1
never get a: 1
level that would: 1
thought would be: 1
item for the: 1
time in a: 1
only one thing: 1
silence harry heard: 1
would have caused: 1
was fighting stop: 1
with his mysterious: 1
readied himself to: 1
a moment the: 1
whispered bellatrix's voice: 1
tell us where: 1
very far and: 1
be ambushed so: 1
succeeded in expecting: 1
just one dementor: 1
bottom and see: 1
dementors within azkaban: 1
beginning in the: 1
save one of: 1
his thoughts the: 1
said harry smoothly: 1
his eyes for: 1
become a howling: 1
solid metal that: 1
the newest auror: 1
seemed to pull: 1
confidence which meant: 1
voice of bella's: 1
what made it: 1
them to go: 1
angry once again: 1
a strangled gasp: 1
have begun to: 1
- but they: 1
you i will: 1
strangely enough hearing: 1
i'll just collapse: 1
the guise of: 1
with the light: 1
couldn't guess my: 1
would have sure: 1
the tiniest difference: 1
face even more: 1
stairs and departed: 1
it costs you: 1
would still be: 1
speak now harry: 1
go dark while: 1
to say that: 1
amelia snapped will: 1
you know if: 1
scrimgeour and shacklebolt: 1
shave harry said: 1
again her anticipations: 1
of censored reasoning: 1
fly through the: 1
scan bahry for: 1
cognitive bias too: 1
practicing the unique: 1
dementors as trickable: 1
the dementors away: 1
but my lord: 1
said bella the: 1
thought that had: 1
now the emptiness: 1
can be ambushed: 1
when that was: 1
his wand behind: 1
forward stay on: 1
the chance to: 1
it in his: 1
was closest to: 1
a quick lumos: 1
shields parted like: 1
she said no: 1
a bit of: 1
fear of death: 1
more even in: 1
on her and: 1
bellatrix's voice came: 1
hostage someone who: 1
where dumbledore turned: 1
be silent fool: 1
to her the: 1
if you knew: 1
well enough to: 1
report amelia said: 1
clarity and indomitable: 1
a small war: 1
questions about the: 1
laid it down: 1
following because the: 1
slump against a: 1
robes looking scorched: 1
and see if: 1
people had been: 1
himself and the: 1
not risk yourself: 1
be burned but: 1
and the thought: 1
looked within the: 1
magic left when: 1
wasn't trying to: 1
find a way: 1
control myself -: 1
cloak - be: 1
didn't just really: 1
even i think: 1
how you think: 1
by expectations -: 1
say that -: 1
carefully constructed shields: 1
might be resistant: 1
younger aurors is: 1
yourself for me: 1
it and an: 1
cell and found: 1
light illuminated the: 1
as before -: 1
a small sound: 1
and he was: 1
regenerative rest here: 1
controlled if i: 1
tell you amelia: 1
harry still had: 1
him from bellatrix: 1
she said simply: 1
we absolutely must: 1
and hours practicing: 1
be enough time: 1
own relief any: 1
long bench that: 1
to sit down: 1
harry hoped that: 1
harry's fingers slid: 1
had mastered he: 1
the dangerous stray: 1
would be enabled: 1
harry strode forward: 1
in that direction: 1
they went up: 1
feel the erosion: 1
cloak from bellatrix: 1
the gasping sounds: 1
for he would: 1
waited for the: 1
exchange for cooperation: 1
an ice cube: 1
the back of: 1
sigh his dear: 1
uneaten power the: 1
say they say: 1
annihilated or they: 1
about the other: 1
waving as though: 1
so do i: 1
the one person: 1
amelia no she: 1
part of the: 1
you primitive screwheads: 1
dementor in a: 1
and you will: 1
level same as: 1
rather than say: 1
descending a stairwell: 1
was now deadly: 1
shouted ora holding: 1
of its drawbacks: 1
this cell block: 1
smoothness on the: 1
the blazing silver: 1
looking in that: 1
a car battery: 1
the whole corridor: 1
in intensity at: 1
and we are: 1
have some nice: 1
up the crystal: 1
the half-moon glasses: 1
would - they: 1
that led downward: 1
as before the: 1
so if harry: 1
it was being: 1
remain silent while: 1
the aurors did: 1
that harry would: 1
isabel whispered back: 1
said coldly and: 1
voice was shaking: 1
computing substrate to: 1
pull had gone: 1
you understand this: 1
or think anyway: 1
in on anything: 1
looking scorched like: 1
say they know: 1
stop with all: 1
can be controlled: 1
she is controlling: 1
for your aurors: 1
dear the old: 1
was sitting upon: 1
whether there would: 1
they would turn: 1
increasing then decreased: 1
was concentrating on: 1
anything turns up: 1
might have just: 1
can't lose tell: 1
urgent demand that: 1
you as well: 1
that the voids: 1
not been there: 1
without needing to: 1
on the ongoing: 1
speak to me: 1
in either case: 1
case - harry: 1
member of her: 1
were coming for: 1
shall have to: 1
and despite the: 1
unremarked i think: 1
just have some: 1
them from direct: 1
was shocked to: 1
was performing listening: 1
death would move: 1
rippled gently in: 1
of descending a: 1
cannot detect them: 1
why you're free: 1
things that would: 1
they came the: 1
forces to be: 1
heard the quick: 1
point of the: 1
to feel a: 1
harder as he: 1
then when that: 1
plans with her: 1
length whichever of: 1
me nothing except: 1
him i i: 1
your actual actions: 1
using frigideiro on: 1
wouldn't make him: 1
us tell us: 1
the wall -: 1
dying air came: 1
could still take: 1
azkaban itself now: 1
difference albus said: 1
allow himself to: 1
her was to: 1
them but i: 1
soar up and: 1
said all right: 1
wand into the: 1
notice his own: 1
couldn't say it: 1
way harry said: 1
shape might be: 1
now between harry: 1
knew bellatrix was: 1
turning her head: 1
thin half a: 1
death the empty: 1
sense or another: 1
harry that maybe: 1
the erosion beginning: 1
it was part: 1
nowhere turn and: 1
care that you: 1
mind the form: 1
overconstrained problems i: 1
and wide and: 1
number went to: 1
didn't allow himself: 1
in one sense: 1
by a scream: 1
bellatrix cast the: 1
more intensely on: 1
not dividing our: 1
do my lord: 1
trying to do: 1
silent fool hissed: 1
wizard sighed any: 1
new form you: 1
mind away from: 1
had been able: 1
employ to detect: 1
was still separate: 1
no matter how: 1
of hiding someone: 1
to depart even: 1
the result of: 1
shadows or i: 1
at vengeance -: 1
same charm on: 1
again it costs: 1
difficult at all: 1
and harry expected: 1
again waving as: 1
still on the: 1
control himself so: 1
amelia as she: 1
changing had not: 1
sat down on: 1
up pulled back: 1
trickable they were: 1
things harry could: 1
lay entirely in: 1
some reason the: 1
and slowly applying: 1
will abandon you: 1
within the cells: 1
by cutting through: 1
well harry's fingers: 1
desperate sobbing scream: 1
is something hidden: 1
leaving bellatrix to: 1
charm for he: 1
not say why: 1
for whatever reason: 1
in response to: 1
take just five: 1
seem easy then: 1
moment the aurors: 1
gently in his: 1
his first transfiguration: 1
the next transfiguration: 1
that form to: 1
to wield deadly: 1
news from the: 1
the cells i: 1
say no just: 1
to do this: 1
later harry realized: 1
she and the: 1
had dimmed the: 1
again bellatrix was: 1
watching him and: 1
that sounded like: 1
sound amused she: 1
if they did: 1
the day side: 1
to do anything: 1
voice when i: 1
one living hand: 1
would go faster: 1
was meant to: 1
weren't supposed to: 1
to say ever: 1
that almost started: 1
and by the: 1
bellatrix had finished: 1
harry could feel: 1
upon the muggle: 1
did a detailed: 1
as spirit you: 1
shall just walk: 1
no easy charm: 1
decision he might: 1
the despair -: 1
if anything turns: 1
resting his magic: 1
tempted to say: 1
me - take: 1
temperature had fallen: 1
around him was: 1
was glad he: 1
anyway harry shut: 1
face had he: 1
were coming my: 1
that had saved: 1
but that was: 1
arts the aurors: 1
of bella's master: 1
- no harry: 1
transfiguration the shape: 1
through the dying: 1
orange gas-light seemed: 1
you made harry: 1
different things harry: 1
not all that: 1
dumbledore's return carrying: 1
thoughts positive cheerful: 1
is that device: 1
next transfiguration my: 1
confusion - no: 1
- thank you: 1
your cloak -: 1
very cold beneath: 1
harry held up: 1
they would stop: 1
concentrated more intensely: 1
but harry still: 1
and sat down: 1
- be silent: 1
glasses will any: 1
cells and touched: 1
which was why: 1
triumph of technological: 1
to hogwarts and: 1
another flight of: 1
he'd told her: 1
censored reasoning process: 1
is dead the: 1
so seemed to: 1
him than ordinary: 1
their air supply: 1
not speak of: 1
have to continue: 1
had no intelligence: 1
then that to: 1
looked upon them: 1
forward and be: 1
done on his: 1
in exchange for: 1
than a simple: 1
but it was: 1
looked upon us: 1
partial transfiguration this: 1
they were merely: 1
many times but: 1
and the shadows: 1
to nowhere turn: 1
think it's a: 1
take back your: 1
using it harry: 1
hole on a: 1
as she turned: 1
harry had hoped: 1
awful words understanding: 1
nothingness lessening with: 1
become part of: 1
said to her: 1
the corridor just: 1
slowly harry hoped: 1
made of that: 1
suppress all those: 1
most of his: 1
doubted even more: 1
call him in: 1
variables most of: 1
gas-light seemed to: 1
to believe that: 1
two strong aurors: 1
worked that was: 1
use or no: 1
they kept on: 1
a moment he: 1
follow or be: 1
sick now it: 1
appropriate or at: 1
his wand to: 1
as they came: 1
the one sight: 1
vengeance - but: 1
fingers slid into: 1
the cells and: 1
that doesn't invoke: 1
hard bed in: 1
his hour's labor: 1
left in her: 1
somnium it had: 1
the emptiness tearing: 1
the muggle device: 1
cube which harry: 1
with each meter: 1
letters upon the: 1
sensible it's over: 1
nondomitability would have: 1
a powerful one: 1
planned for them: 1
transfiguration this spell: 1
of stairs there: 1
to her feet: 1
her harry gestured: 1
those thoughts about: 1
one sight the: 1
each meter they: 1
to be there: 1
emptiness seemed to: 1
as he strode: 1
love her back: 1
problem was that: 1
on as before: 1
going down level: 1
- i see: 1
irrational it was: 1
a touch of: 1
on the hard: 1
the thought that: 1
his own self: 1
have a fix: 1
her life is: 1
the training harry: 1
take that moment: 1
name of noelle: 1
told her to: 1
where she hides: 1
been looking in: 1
the benefit of: 1
the dementors have: 1
lord you -: 1
winds and the: 1
up his hand: 1
the hands of: 1
ambushed nonsense my: 1
to dry tiny: 1
azkaban would seem: 1
had passed how: 1
their coverage that: 1
harry gestured to: 1
slid into the: 1
whole corridor and: 1
nonsense my dear: 1
dementors were coming: 1
on the floor: 1
harry heard the: 1
to do harry: 1
my lord indeed: 1
for harry to: 1
began walking and: 1
the silence harry: 1
lord - thank: 1
the dry high: 1
reason the phrase: 1
just whoever was: 1
scraps of their: 1
he was not: 1
was careful to: 1
saw amelia told: 1
script gleamed on: 1
if harry believed: 1
sense the holes: 1
benefits with none: 1
about now what: 1
the dying air: 1
a voice of: 1
return it no: 1
harry's own counterquestion: 1
of himself and: 1
look in or: 1
for him to: 1
open and he: 1
prisoners knew the: 1
had scraps of: 1
was strained the: 1
they'd yet to: 1
have said that: 1
touched his wand: 1
half a millimeter: 1
to return there: 1
believe something how: 1
assume that how: 1
a solid thing: 1
questions what happened: 1
though he kept: 1
all those thoughts: 1
said gryffindor even: 1
cloth i left: 1
away the prisoners: 1
from below words: 1
laugh and said: 1
she made of: 1
rescuing a prisoner: 1
do not offend: 1
harry drew up: 1
there is something: 1
patronus approaching and: 1
quit said his: 1
said pointing his: 1
his wake harry: 1
aurors to examine: 1
all my lord: 1
carrying in his: 1
that nearly an: 1
of industrial-strength glue: 1
side's fear of: 1
hand fingers spread: 1
descending and the: 1
himself to cast: 1
hadn't seen the: 1
i see said: 1
times but never: 1
cutting through a: 1
be my lord: 1
a death doll: 1
started amelia running: 1
- the old: 1
a word to: 1
or no use: 1
finally succeeded in: 1
none of its: 1
it condemnation was: 1
prisoners could feel: 1
said making his: 1
case - the: 1
he'd done on: 1
myself - the: 1
a good chance: 1
cities harry wasn't: 1
ever love her: 1
the world passed: 1
finished descending and: 1
lady by the: 1
even if he: 1
heard the dementors: 1
say that harry: 1
response to bellatrix's: 1
her place this: 1
blue was green: 1
yourself another piece: 1
rest harry was: 1
chewing on a: 1
his magic and: 1
my mere glance: 1
and the pull: 1
not reveal his: 1
penetrate that but: 1
helped strangely enough: 1
could while he: 1
i mean it: 1
of noelle curry: 1
strangled gasp like: 1
that the previous: 1
could be jumped: 1
wizard my apologies: 1
impossible it was: 1
now deadly strong: 1
and an urgent: 1
but never challenge: 1
and i'm your: 1
moment the blue: 1
just achieved fusion: 1
had only as: 1
way too much: 1
command stop the: 1
dementors still can't: 1
were controlled only: 1
this time as: 1
jumped by cutting: 1
holding up her: 1
dumbledore turned to: 1
it seemed like: 1
dementors did have: 1
my lord fast: 1
rest here and: 1
check on this: 1
recent prisoners had: 1
handy about now: 1
nothing to oblivate: 1
ignorance by asking: 1
keep going down: 1
of will couldn't: 1
idea and i'm: 1
stop the shadows: 1
some of them: 1
dead the dementors: 1
against a wall: 1
and harry realized: 1
wizard was already: 1
in the corridor: 1
and the partial: 1
said dumbledore then: 1
to transfigure things: 1
really planned for: 1
than say my: 1
on water from: 1
his fate lay: 1
door and the: 1
sort of censored: 1
voice who thought: 1
many cuts his: 1
way her life: 1
wouldn't look too: 1
scream from the: 1
upon the bed: 1
pouch and began: 1
back down the: 1
and rippled gently: 1
within azkaban itself: 1
have work to: 1
people we carry: 1
harry bellatrix gave: 1
by level same: 1
examine on the: 1
eyes for a: 1
ongoing transfiguration he: 1
stairs slowly harry: 1
now it was: 1
is controlling them: 1
labor then when: 1
passed how much: 1
teams had worked: 1
old wizard strode: 1
had made it: 1
high voice of: 1
whose light illuminated: 1
her voice first: 1
way of hiding: 1
but she said: 1
feel them my: 1
cry went up: 1
the actual movie: 1
then i'll feel: 1
begun to care: 1
that moment some: 1
exposure to the: 1
inquiry and bellatrix: 1
couldn't break into: 1
in absolute darkness: 1
controlled only by: 1
corridor and received: 1
harry hoped he'd: 1
absolute darkness with: 1
her there's no: 1
crystal clarity and: 1
a moment before: 1
optimal algorithm without: 1
the dementors that's: 1
and the dark: 1
couldn't sense the: 1
gestured to her: 1
besides the cloak: 1
him vulnerable once: 1
in a cracked: 1
be able to: 1
not to allow: 1
to draw on: 1
the corridor had: 1
him of course: 1
then would it: 1
to anyone little: 1
himself so easily: 1
cold crept over: 1
off no matter: 1
i scared the: 1
upward bellatrix and: 1
nice regenerative rest: 1
transfiguration he would: 1
so that the: 1
said her voice: 1
now only his: 1
end it was: 1
make him or: 1
increasing in intensity: 1
in a quavering: 1
the psychiatric healer: 1
victims in exchange: 1
harry listened it: 1
but they'd kept: 1
bottom said the: 1
all the will: 1
technological ingenuity any: 1
the senior member: 1
thought it and: 1
had worked a: 1
thin blanket pulled: 1
more than a: 1
bahry one-hand was: 1
that would be: 1
thought that would: 1
listening in the: 1
howling draw toward: 1
above and the: 1
said i scared: 1
her feet and: 1
with his thoughts: 1
from it condemnation: 1
your auror alive: 1
and leave him: 1
between the original: 1
primitive screwheads listen: 1
the emaciated sorceress: 1
might be tall: 1
the stairs slumped: 1
to his brain: 1
way as when: 1
the end and: 1
would mate to: 1
enough hearing those: 1
could ever love: 1
up the stairs: 1
really say that: 1
he was glad: 1
hidden new requirement: 1
as once again: 1
give up the: 1
see bellatrix's face: 1
and did not: 1
are her aurors: 1
of death stopped: 1
fate lay entirely: 1
couldn't cast the: 1
coming the swirling: 1
my lord said: 1
unconscious bellatrix on: 1
to level seven: 1
had saved him: 1
you think doesn't: 1
sign might i: 1
magical device that: 1
moment he sure: 1
locked behind him: 1
were gone harry: 1
and around him: 1
he might become: 1
crossed the halfway: 1
from above and: 1
shouldn't risk yourself: 1
move forward and: 1
- i quit: 1
particular triumph of: 1
instant harry considered: 1
in handy about: 1
tall and wide: 1
them as creatures: 1
nothing except my: 1
transfigured technological device: 1
stopping believed they: 1
is a really: 1
as the holes: 1
that harry didn't: 1
can control myself: 1
fear he was: 1
hard enough that: 1
couldn't make himself: 1
demand without needing: 1
did he he: 1
with none of: 1
said again bellatrix: 1
as creatures think: 1
you're not seriously: 1
he hadn't seen: 1
forward not listening: 1
think doesn't affect: 1
was equally ready: 1
would not harm: 1
decide to sacrifice: 1
bellatrix black we: 1
cast a quick: 1
the aurors might: 1
to detect his: 1
that was what: 1
there were screams: 1
controlling just one: 1
will couldn't suppress: 1
went to hogwarts: 1
for a powerful: 1
dementors hadn't yet: 1
this particular triumph: 1
retreated back as: 1
had he said: 1
things that harry: 1
by since someone: 1
no harry said: 1
and then harry: 1
a quarter of: 1
lord would do: 1
muggle device rather: 1
invincible there was: 1
strongest had only: 1
it was in: 1
her aurors lowering: 1
he doubted even: 1
that maybe he: 1
dementors - they: 1
soon the fear: 1
on his decision: 1
my patronus charm: 1

voice that's where: 1
anyway if he: 1

harry did not: 1
and - we: 1
at the far: 1
more than he: 1
think of the: 1
to oblivate him: 1
the spot -: 1
ridiculously overconstrained problems: 1
would you know: 1

not much more: 1

from others' expectations: 1
almost started amelia: 1
led downward not: 1
dozen wounds in: 1
keeping the edge: 1
bellatrix and had: 1
switch off no: 1
the idea anyway: 1
to be ambushed: 1
his one living: 1
harry hadn't really: 1
trick yourself into: 1
out of the: 1
overestimated how much: 1
went to the: 1
shacklebolt to keep: 1
locked door and: 1
the perfect smoothness: 1
metal beginning to: 1
amelia check them: 1
whatever reason they: 1
sort of thing: 1

against self-deception was: 1
fast ones -: 1
sitting upon the: 1
walking and take: 1
saved him before: 1
transfigured form there: 1
this is ridiculous: 1
you to report: 1
and as he: 1
back empty-handed even: 1

guess my lord: 1
where auror bahry: 1
could not quite: 1
shaking they said: 1
reality the light: 1
harry couldn't sense: 1
spiral from top: 1
like he'd fought: 1
it was as: 1
further question which: 1
faster harry hoped: 1
repeat what you: 1
bellatrix had not: 1
the partial transfiguration: 1

again or think: 1
a wall couldn't: 1

own desires and: 1
you weren't supposed: 1
it thought harry: 1
third of the: 1
annihilation - but: 1
fear returned harry: 1
a level voice: 1
harry said pointing: 1
them already starting: 1
negative thoughts because: 1
the dementors' pit: 1
had not expected: 1
a ceiling and: 1
three spirals in: 1
chance to check: 1
charm to protect: 1
and bellatrix and: 1
the whirlpool of: 1
the hole on: 1
either case -: 1
of nondomitability would: 1

like a rather: 1
began to move: 1
dementors' pit and: 1
of their own: 1
routine not much: 1
listened it was: 1
anymore and that: 1
they know you're: 1
up in advance: 1
he kept his: 1
the snake so: 1
you nothing amelia: 1
hurricane winds and: 1
- harry hadn't: 1
said the wrong: 1
time that sounded: 1
but between the: 1
and then bellatrix's: 1
the beginning of: 1
frozen using frigideiro: 1
all that much: 1
their own pseudo-intelligence: 1
down beside the: 1

this escape was: 1
from the dementors: 1
minutes had passed: 1
chocolate held in: 1

harry got up: 1
a deathly hallow: 1
the bed of: 1
so easily couldn't: 1

and then -: 1
woman was pushing: 1
ought to practice: 1
form to the: 1
them either said: 1
he knew bellatrix: 1
walk from top: 1
but harry did: 1
said quietly and: 1
longer exists that: 1
half-moon glasses will: 1
were many different: 1
the dementors still: 1
moment later harry: 1
door locked behind: 1
to the gasping: 1
- we have: 1
said a dry: 1
that device you: 1
have ceased to: 1
animagi or traps: 1
it costs them: 1
the absences the: 1
harry said neutrally: 1
the empty pull: 1
your new form: 1
his brain you're: 1
once and probably: 1
way of defeating: 1
harry laid it: 1
occurred to harry: 1
letting her through: 1
hidden by a: 1
dumbledore then he: 1
the voids retreated: 1
between harry and: 1
set binding technology: 1
them my lord: 1
i know said: 1
azkaban there was: 1
him not to: 1
we carry on: 1
time for him: 1
sat up pulled: 1
some approaching black: 1
wizard said cheerfully: 1
hours practicing the: 1
needing to go: 1
unique special case: 1
silver beard contemplatively: 1
was dumbledore who: 1
it's a dumb: 1
he was changing: 1
- they say: 1
nodded decisively and: 1
this wouldn't make: 1
how would you: 1
her anticipations are: 1
frigideiro on water: 1
deathly hallow but: 1
relief any more: 1
him cast a: 1
until he and: 1
took a moment: 1
we have a: 1
farewell my lord: 1
thinking that he: 1
sorely tempted to: 1
must harry lay: 1
that option focus: 1
cells i saw: 1
might i ask: 1
lord replied again: 1
have ordered him: 1
new requirement harry: 1
that will open: 1
actions i did: 1
was as he: 1
direction of course: 1
be sensible it's: 1
harry took a: 1
own will his: 1
depart he was: 1
light of human: 1
of things that: 1
bellatrix on the: 1
fifteen-inch wand of: 1
the repair work: 1
scrap of cloth: 1
sorceress was sitting: 1
had helped strangely: 1
while he waited: 1
harry was careful: 1
of human cities: 1
door and looked: 1
closing his eyes: 1
flinched from it: 1
reality apart from: 1
from the floor: 1
corridor next to: 1
held in his: 1
her under the: 1
to the blazing: 1
witch in sudden: 1
said slytherin you: 1
on many cuts: 1
have said if: 1
bellatrix afterward even: 1
was refusing to: 1
my lord you: 1
would seem easy: 1
coming - i: 1
a time in: 1
shut down the: 1
hoping that whoever: 1
spiral then increased: 1
the metal beginning: 1
and began drawing: 1
had opened the: 1
of azkaban there: 1
over him hoping: 1
bellatrix said hesitantly: 1
would make him: 1
at the time: 1
no intelligence of: 1
was going to: 1
sounds that came: 1
harry had set: 1
to answer questions: 1
separated them from: 1
and go and: 1
say it he: 1
bella said a: 1
harry had thought: 1
wand of unidentifiable: 1
despair - you: 1
had not noticed: 1
the edge out: 1
close shave harry: 1
couldn't slump against: 1
the fear thundered: 1
once again their: 1
he had not: 1
will tell you: 1
it down upon: 1
to report amelia: 1
harry believed hard: 1
someone had opened: 1
of you speak: 1
up a desperate: 1
he waited for: 1
but the wounds: 1
technology to magic: 1
thoughts about how: 1
only the prisoners: 1
emptiness had become: 1
glue fumes in: 1
detect his own: 1
that was drawn: 1
quavering voice could: 1
made it routine: 1
and then he: 1
you bella said: 1
in admonition his: 1
which meant repeat: 1
harder was that: 1

of the roof: 2
brief moment when: 2
on the ground: 2

a brief moment: 2
on his face: 2
harry's other hand: 2

lily's side all: 1
secret mr pettigrew: 1
she hadn't mentioned: 1
times before he: 1
you ever need: 1
screaming while part: 1
from the ground: 1
didn't answer he: 1
have foreseen it: 1
said he wiped: 1
the other way: 1
mr lupin's temporary: 1
now i think: 1
did black have: 1
direction harry's increasingly: 1
dark lord's shadow: 1
or wanted to: 1
harry said anything: 1
things about people: 1
have helped in: 1
hundred students just: 1
that another thirty: 1
and it wasn't: 1
remembered the last: 1
can't help but: 1
managed to gasp: 1
which of these: 1
he accelerated downward: 1
who was available: 1
purpose than by: 1
by your friends: 1
fix shabby was: 1
castle amid half: 1
you do know: 1
really awful about: 1
black getting caught: 1
hated that only: 1
anything you know: 1
like that or: 1
said he grew: 1
his voice crisp: 1
scrabbled at the: 1
there isn't any: 1
that he'd done: 1
can tell it: 1
of us and: 1
was the only: 1
read not to: 1
considering his own: 1
muggles hated that: 1
said remus and: 1
peter stood by: 1
only the satisfied: 1
i suppose i: 1
with dumbledore but: 1
mr lupin your: 1
harry wasn't sure: 1
it said something: 1
harry he just: 1
hogwarts i used: 1
wow daphne said: 1
the best of: 1
or put them: 1
a slow grave: 1
blinked twice at: 1
right now however: 1
man puzzled he: 1
had created house: 1
almost fall over: 1
really do hate: 1
until the day: 1
burned at the: 1
other parents i: 1
thought that long: 1
reached the man: 1
treating you well: 1
something from our: 1
i should know: 1
his fingers failed: 1
will help him: 1
any extenuating circumstances: 1
tall order mr: 1
some of the: 1
harry's increasingly desperate: 1
mind was another: 1
can you tell: 1
helping him to: 1
nodded harry are: 1
him the while: 1
trying to apologize: 1
created house elves: 1
everything and peter: 1
my father's friend: 1
shaking a bit: 1
warning we all: 1
there be more: 1
peter pettigrew he: 1
and yet he: 1
way that simple: 1
script you've got: 1
part - to: 1
most brave it: 1
obviously fair right: 1
appeared again beneath: 1
not allowed visitors: 1
ever discovered they: 1
would have done: 1
but the ravenclaw: 1
my father a: 1
life was terrified: 1
any possible excuse: 1
guess you had: 1
disappointed it was: 1
didn't smile it: 1
it already sorry: 1
made a face: 1
other hand held: 1
the hat had: 1
something the death: 1
said they're both: 1
in remus's eyes: 1
ever heard about: 1
should remember -: 1
whoever had created: 1
ways i imagined: 1
have been black: 1
young the unhappy: 1
circumstances harry said: 1
hours and for: 1
girls tried to: 1
much time he: 1
said anything that: 1
afraid than any: 1
weighing the factors: 1
begin at the: 1
moment for a: 1
remus nodded water: 1
hermione was the: 1
you would have: 1
to their own: 1
and then thank: 1
with peter pettigrew: 1
dark lord than: 1
and lily's side: 1
that there wouldn't: 1
charm by strength: 1
rise again making: 1
harry had seen: 1
which harry had: 1
took a seat: 1
said draco and: 1
and i judge: 1
just drop back: 1
think i've sort: 1
harry i think: 1
black wanted so: 1
the sake of: 1
uh a little: 1
the right thing: 1
way i don't: 1
he was to: 1
i didn't mean: 1
a word that: 1
him off it: 1
girl hermione didn't: 1
see it is: 1
would have been: 1
house elves in: 1
denying sentient beings: 1
being efficient professor: 1
the one in: 1
who was holding: 1
voted to have: 1
the sudden leap: 1
is going to: 1
is - harry: 1
- remus nodded: 1
murder said a: 1
is about said: 1
the whole crowd: 1
can't judge your: 1
man seemed to: 1
seen from him: 1
screwed up enough: 1
wiped a hand: 1
happy story harry: 1
desperate offers were: 1
understand and that: 1
i imagined we: 1
his own eyes: 1
stop either of: 1
were lovers weren't: 1
b worried about: 1
one in front: 1
quidditch that harry: 1
been unspeakably evil: 1
increasingly desperate offers: 1
hours said the: 1
lurching cushioning feeling: 1
and then something: 1
his finger on: 1
into slytherin or: 1
that only the: 1
uncomfortable i suppose: 1
deflect suspicion but: 1
in the middle: 1
first-year hufflepuff named: 1
we were young: 1
remus his voice: 1
a while so: 1
that couldn't have: 1
something like that: 1
talk if you: 1
offers were going: 1
his best friends: 1
james pulled off: 1
well enough so: 1
worried about bothering: 1
hufflepuff named neville: 1
a bully said: 1
orient itself in: 1
on you said: 1
now by denying: 1
said harry in: 1
wanted to believe: 1
think it might: 1
so there was: 1
dignity about him: 1
wonder why peter: 1
who thought it: 1
real thing before: 1
father a bully: 1
right thing now: 1
i meant to: 1
you too that: 1
friendship until the: 1
caught i can't: 1
faster than gravity: 1
like the one: 1
him harry nodded: 1
on hermione that: 1
i understood why: 1
peter had known: 1
blinking rather hard: 1
this harry's mind: 1
mean to have: 1
harry's arm harry's: 1
story a student: 1
harry had to: 1
wasn't a killing: 1
wooden desk and: 1
for a whole: 1
you falling out: 1
slowly reluctantly and: 1
next day practically: 1
his watch and: 1
of their style: 1
know why harry: 1
of the shabby: 1
silently walked toward: 1
wizard no matter: 1
like a secret: 1
peter knew the: 1
ground his head: 1
i kinda did: 1
friendly rival after: 1
quirrell had i: 1
him rise again: 1
that sparked the: 1
that he'd lost: 1
drunk the feather-falling: 1
can't be right: 1
there were things: 1
it was too: 1
but think it: 1
- a brief: 1
said his own: 1
number of girls: 1
harry for a: 1
were young the: 1
just something from: 1
hermione that harry: 1
worth black getting: 1
cut off harry: 1
thing to do: 1
to me it: 1
drop back to: 1
remus blinked twice: 1
they have to: 1
said not really: 1
meet said harry: 1
bold and strong: 1
tried to think: 1
he'd seen the: 1
who thinks it's: 1
right after a: 1
lupin wouldn't be: 1
scarred face who: 1
would deflect suspicion: 1
none of us: 1
the loss of: 1
picking themselves up: 1
might matter remus: 1
silence fell did: 1
it myself professor: 1
well my parents: 1
sit down harry: 1
the same trap: 1
i am told: 1
reverse mulhanney dive: 1
made a lightning: 1
was unsteady there: 1
say that would: 1
dawned on hermione: 1
him in azkaban: 1
hermione was doing: 1
really black wanted: 1
thank you harry: 1
important harry i'm: 1
little event and: 1
for revenge on: 1
had been shaped: 1
sitting on suggesting: 1
was he just: 1
he'd told the: 1
stool just like: 1
do part of: 1
the sky harry: 1
of the castle: 1
seek out mr: 1
be at hogwarts: 1
seems - that: 1
harry remus said: 1
things going on: 1
and then without: 1
tried not to: 1
you to remus: 1
thing he'd seen: 1
do you said: 1
enough where did: 1
it it hurt: 1
terrified that he'd: 1
it a lesson: 1
my father have: 1
resist the temptation: 1
lupin your concerns: 1
supposed to read: 1
us and if: 1
about bothering house: 1
whispered and then: 1
them finally harry: 1
can ask certainly: 1
to mind and: 1
what to say: 1
hint no warning: 1
the man -: 1
had left to: 1
about that i: 1
by strength alone: 1
puzzlement was plain: 1
impossible done the: 1
please tell me: 1
smile it might: 1
to hear the: 1
say to that: 1
mr pettigrew even: 1
could know with: 1
black was making: 1
do you have: 1
after a while: 1
that means there: 1
of a sea: 1
people think gryffindors: 1
it's true they: 1
instantly agreed the: 1
her climb up: 1
would have helped: 1
is not a: 1
quibbler headlines boy-who-lived: 1
lesson in preparedness: 1
- to think: 1
there wouldn't be: 1
i actually did: 1
tried to calculate: 1
draco sounding amused: 1
kept on trying: 1
awful about that: 1
he almost couldn't: 1
about the exact: 1
out things about: 1
you he sounded: 1
qualms rather silly: 1
sure at all: 1
said a strained: 1
you have already: 1
himself or wanted: 1
leap of harry's: 1
i introduce you: 1
all the ways: 1
his eyebrows have: 1
said his eyes: 1
harry was crying: 1
a friend and: 1
especially since harry: 1
and if they're: 1
it was as: 1
buried beneath adult: 1
sir said the: 1
voice choked up: 1
little young not: 1
however standing just: 1
is here temporarily: 1
set harry upright: 1
are not allowed: 1
you can't judge: 1
lot harder to: 1
the wonders of: 1
that he wasn't: 1
harry remembered the: 1
now lying in: 1
two hundred students: 1
holding harry in: 1
in azkaban remus: 1
find out things: 1
easy but the: 1
wanted you to: 1
a whole week: 1
a sad affair: 1
killing matter like: 1
to know why: 1
secrets harry he: 1
have our wands: 1
draco i thought: 1
temptation of secrets: 1
death eaters are: 1
it still hurts: 1
that harry had: 1
harry in godric's: 1
himself harry had: 1
harry didn't answer: 1
over and done: 1
it is not: 1
not a plot: 1
i'm not supposed: 1
and very seriously: 1
it might matter: 1
to stand between: 1
to be there: 1
seen the real: 1
waste the effort: 1
summon mr potter: 1
it was a: 1
potter to their: 1
to her not: 1
the thing to: 1
own voice was: 1
the roof so: 1
property of the: 1
expensive robes that: 1
a small wooden: 1
those secrets harry: 1
could tell you: 1
you must do: 1
sitting up from: 1
several times before: 1
but she still: 1
man shook his: 1
judge your father: 1
lily holding you: 1
gasp professor quirrell: 1
him to gryffindor: 1
they wanted kept: 1
her as my: 1
he did as: 1
a brief silence: 1
was trying to: 1
it by being: 1
do so there: 1
when remus said: 1
nodded a brief: 1
the real thing: 1
have been gravely: 1
have any unfinished: 1
sort of lurching: 1
somehow there was: 1
the ground and: 1
father's friend and: 1
fell over everything: 1
house elves harry: 1
potion kicking in: 1
encounter with dumbledore: 1
and that she: 1
kinda did feel: 1
for them said: 1
already met harry: 1
so it seemed: 1
sea of expectant: 1
mr lupin and: 1
burn you too: 1
couldn't fix shabby: 1
then without any: 1
roof so i'm: 1
concern had been: 1
where you were: 1
longbottom alice and: 1
off a triple: 1
feather-falling potion kicking: 1
of us doesn't: 1
that she desperately: 1
not understand and: 1
desk harry guessed: 1
question while remus: 1
dumb ones said: 1
what about my: 1
pause then -: 1
that is good: 1
black who got: 1
put his talents: 1
i not insisted: 1
since harry himself: 1
just to make: 1
to think that: 1
it - and: 1
the icy walls: 1
but it might: 1
gryffindors should be: 1
you gently the: 1
fell did black: 1
me go okay: 1
real apology to: 1
one adult witness: 1
the next day: 1
said slowly reluctantly: 1
hermione had felt: 1
a whisper i: 1
was doing the: 1
remember knew only: 1
falling body and: 1
and wanted you: 1
with a small: 1
that or was: 1
to kill you: 1
that harry didn't: 1
to hear harry: 1
afterward and you: 1
back the first: 1
so i don't: 1
not too young: 1
calculation before he: 1
harry searched for: 1
anything of what: 1
our school days: 1
sure mr lupin's: 1
again he seemed: 1
office was a: 1
quirrell didn't stand: 1
harry studied the: 1
they all thought: 1
and i didn't: 1
disapproval what a: 1
sounded a bit: 1
outside the great: 1
slytherin you see: 1
where did you: 1
think you ought: 1
quirrell was already: 1
slightly bad about: 1
go of harry's: 1
you harry whispered: 1
up from where: 1
didn't stand up: 1
turning sad i: 1
reading quietly and: 1
expect it to: 1
objected a gryffindor: 1
i think i've: 1
obtained by fine: 1
when harry's stomach: 1
his voice wasn't: 1
a gryffindor girl: 1
finish the remaining-time: 1
this is a: 1
from him harry: 1
itself in the: 1
in you yourself: 1
of people who: 1
he couldn't touch: 1
i see but: 1
while hermione was: 1
should have remembered: 1
gentle smile where: 1
a triple reverse: 1
to the best: 1
fair right now: 1
exclusive property of: 1
sort of guessed: 1
- harry was: 1
matter remus looked: 1
out what to: 1
on here that: 1
could speak can: 1
man's voice choked: 1
- harry's mouth: 1
rival after a: 1
where he almost: 1
said remus his: 1
this time it: 1
for the sake: 1
looked at harry: 1
person that he: 1
it possible he: 1
him the most: 1
about do you: 1
was already sitting: 1
everything a tall: 1
i thought that: 1
something annoying and: 1
you to notice: 1
desperately trying to: 1
make him seek: 1
came to mind: 1
didn't think fast: 1
the man he: 1
being naturally nasty: 1
harry nodded a: 1
since over and: 1
eyes shining brightly: 1
man holding harry: 1
robes that wouldn't: 1
some such harry: 1
the effort it: 1
sorted into hufflepuff: 1
out mr lupin: 1
he just wanted: 1
of what mr: 1
times to stand: 1
should know that: 1
fell there was: 1
about why he: 1
got no idea: 1
something pulled on: 1
was in the: 1
too soon honestly: 1
know well everything: 1
man said no: 1
at his watch: 1
remus's voice or: 1
so this is: 1
do it by: 1
fix the outcome: 1
a tiny rump: 1
because to me: 1
and he accelerated: 1
not really that: 1
on the small: 1
already sitting up: 1
idea which of: 1
me said harry: 1
at that i: 1
put his finger: 1
my parents harry: 1
he'll be all: 1
of us where: 1
changed a number: 1
harry guessed that: 1
more directly and: 1
if it was: 1
off it might: 1
lily ah said: 1
boy who is: 1
but um aren't: 1
his arms of: 1
i should have: 1
quietly and harry: 1
what he did: 1
really that means: 1
of the hufflepuffs: 1
another thirty minutes: 1
ending in vast: 1
of thirteen had: 1
mustache you have: 1
father by what: 1
these girls might: 1
a lot harder: 1
who got james: 1
population of hogwarts: 1
thought of you: 1
about him that: 1
your nappies mr: 1
just outside the: 1
to where he: 1
in a reflexively: 1
was pinched in: 1
from where he'd: 1
efficient professor quirrell: 1
quite uncomfortable i: 1
hogwarts hermione was: 1
like godric bold: 1
for coming the: 1
sent him to: 1
she still had: 1
part of their: 1
more afraid than: 1
where did we: 1
if he'd known: 1
ground and each: 1
to suspect that: 1
knew that black: 1
going to be: 1
time he had: 1
was part of: 1
because i meant: 1
your father by: 1
grave nod once: 1
not insisted that: 1
hear peter pettigrew's: 1
in first-year hufflepuff: 1
best of harry's: 1
given them a: 1
something about a: 1
carefully balanced himself: 1
want to understand: 1
the dark lord: 1
i could tell: 1
enough never mind: 1
looked at the: 1
think that he: 1
specifically it said: 1
puzzled he should: 1
shrieking of all: 1
through hogwarts i: 1
same trap myself: 1
to apologize and: 1
now picking themselves: 1
grip his fingers: 1
wasn't easy but: 1
this office much: 1
elves harry himself: 1
you're older but: 1
what a thing: 1
he would have: 1
harry that if: 1
his forehead well: 1
knowing it with: 1
they're ever discovered: 1
i have a: 1
by what he: 1
did as a: 1
low quality not: 1
had been unspeakably: 1
passage of time: 1
aren't we uh: 1
stone room with: 1
so i'm doing: 1
harry whispered and: 1
few quibbler headlines: 1
said harry okay: 1
draco looked at: 1
they silently walked: 1
life that he'd: 1
expectant female faces: 1
the ground his: 1
that would make: 1
up peter was: 1
there was an: 1
falling out of: 1
not to bother: 1
have been the: 1
when you were: 1
of his desk: 1
and strong like: 1
well what happened: 1
hufflepuff since to: 1
nodded water glittering: 1
by the passage: 1
mr lupin would: 1
did my father: 1
hand held the: 1
of him in: 1
remus said you: 1
stool in front: 1
his wand without: 1
couldn't talk if: 1
not have been: 1
wouldn't fix the: 1
and done and: 1
hurt worse to: 1
said harry controlling: 1
backspin the whole: 1
edge and then: 1
sad i see: 1
us have our: 1
harry potter had: 1
kill him to: 1
harry had lost: 1
her fellow generals: 1
- i guess: 1
the man standing: 1
the castle amid: 1
ashamed of not: 1
eyes now i: 1
thought it possible: 1
a little while: 1
house elves specifically: 1
draco drop harry: 1
pettigrew's story a: 1
the man you: 1
definitely for the: 1
or so it: 1
felt himself harry: 1
wasn't enough to: 1
i used to: 1
harry it's not: 1
so she'd said: 1
had lost two: 1
this little event: 1
glowing gold for: 1
choked to where: 1
drudgery they had: 1
couldn't have been: 1
a reflexively terrified: 1
mind that you'd: 1
less than twenty-four: 1
repair charms couldn't: 1
long time ago: 1
and nodded to: 1
real that it: 1
begun screaming while: 1
man he let: 1
doesn't sound nice: 1
fierce now and: 1
possible he must: 1
scarred face that: 1
can guess who: 1
rump part of: 1
couldn't touch his: 1
elves not to: 1
was appropriate so: 1
fine robes that: 1
hard several times: 1
have her climb: 1
arm harry's other: 1
of these girls: 1
you were i: 1
place had been: 1
running it was: 1
have been for: 1
- yeah said: 1
getting caught i: 1
now and proud: 1
about said draco: 1
remus finished his: 1
it with your: 1
tried to leap: 1
was crying he: 1
and frank's boy: 1
outcome though she: 1
your concerns are: 1
couldn't resist them: 1
snorted girls they: 1
crying he couldn't: 1
was beginning to: 1
the passage of: 1
any idea which: 1
be a lot: 1
alice and frank's: 1
all thought -: 1
students in the: 1
harry that death: 1
are your stepparents: 1
a girl who: 1
i suppose they: 1
hear it from: 1
harry may i: 1
he seemed to: 1
beginning to suspect: 1
he'd ever felt: 1
girls they silently: 1
lower other parents: 1
were cheering -: 1
dinner especially since: 1
holding you or: 1
and peter stood: 1
do not have: 1
that harry definitely: 1
for a long: 1
older that sparked: 1
patronus charm though: 1
in his arms: 1
even some of: 1
in gryffindor remus: 1
harry carefully balanced: 1
blood wasn't destiny: 1
their own particular: 1

myself professor quirrell: 1
the roof in: 1
stomach tried to: 1
whenever he held: 1
but really harry: 1
of girls tried: 1
let me go: 1
time there's someone: 1
the unhappy puzzlement: 1
to kill him: 1
just the general: 1
still trying to: 1
in a way: 1
have her fall: 1

you see we: 1
everyone that he: 1

only other person: 1
lupin apparently you: 1
utter shock on: 1
you hear that: 1
had to swallow: 1
or maybe ravenclaw: 1
a killing matter: 1
was terrified that: 1
man had said: 1
doing this for: 1
almost a whisper: 1
accident isn't it: 1
fall over utter: 1
it really black: 1
the edge and: 1
she did not: 1
they there was: 1
again - every: 1

plot or anything: 1
shocked you mean: 1
romantic they burn: 1
his throat and: 1
against slytherin you: 1
consider it a: 1
of secrets and: 1
but if peter: 1
wand without it: 1
that wouldn't have: 1
done something annoying: 1
mr lupin apparently: 1
mr lupin if: 1
an awkward pause: 1
possible excuse for: 1
brightly james pulled: 1
unspeakably evil obviously: 1
coming the man: 1
seemed to almost: 1
a secret mr: 1
judge myself remus: 1
he'd fallen on: 1
said quietly his: 1
bother house elves: 1
pulled on harry: 1
had thought it: 1
had thought that: 1
nappies mr lupin's: 1
certainly harry said: 1
father have any: 1
said draco sounding: 1
to get married: 1
details from up: 1
into his throat: 1
said that the: 1
lupin's temporary office: 1
later but that: 1
bad about making: 1
whatever it is: 1
opened and begun: 1
man who seemed: 1
professor quirrell i: 1
was a pause: 1
the exclusive property: 1
it wasn't a: 1
and harry couldn't: 1
harry because i: 1
good to hear: 1
every bit as: 1
fair number of: 1
off harry was: 1
must have knocked: 1
oh consider it: 1
of books he: 1
the ways i: 1
idea what this: 1
now however standing: 1
think gryffindors should: 1
had heard of: 1
them he would: 1
too mr lupin: 1
was when remus: 1
he was trying: 1
who seemed to: 1
he wasn't supposed: 1
let me know: 1
voice or the: 1
wasn't sure mr: 1
seen the falling: 1
had kept on: 1
he was my: 1
- and said: 1
a small stool: 1
too that can't: 1
if it doesn't: 1
a sort of: 1
be creative and: 1
been available to: 1
together and if: 1
with fine robes: 1
that he tried: 1
failed and harry: 1
older but really: 1
might think you: 1
seeing her as: 1
again beneath the: 1
eaters made up: 1
a little young: 1
worn by the: 1
the drudgery they: 1
that there be: 1
had been misplaced: 1
half the female: 1
and his body: 1
he'd been sorted: 1
that the ravenclaw: 1
fellow generals ever: 1
think should hear: 1
that didn't mean: 1
so happy that: 1
harry said remus: 1
me anything you: 1
such things to: 1
there just the: 1
just exhausted i: 1
misplaced considering his: 1
his life that: 1
was too soon: 1
honestly said harry: 1
hufflepuffs were cheering: 1
be you falling: 1
to watch besides: 1
over utter shock: 1
a guilty and: 1
myself whatever it: 1
sometimes it still: 1
of her fellow: 1
in preparedness mr: 1
why are you: 1
draco and let: 1
have you he: 1
to tell -: 1
about my harry: 1
were i was: 1
fact of a: 1
i'm doing this: 1
before he could: 1
about a person: 1
if peter was: 1
his eyes shining: 1
them higher or: 1
four of his: 1
in godric's hollow: 1
use and i: 1
go and harry: 1
this for revenge: 1
once remus said: 1
good heavens said: 1
salt-and-pepper mustache you: 1
did start seeing: 1
know if you: 1
instruct students in: 1
mind made a: 1
intuition actually said: 1
the first place: 1
revenge on you: 1
to almost fall: 1
anything there was: 1
while remus said: 1
small wooden stool: 1
tiny rump part: 1
own particular arms: 1
sighed i can: 1
be - mr: 1
petunia and lily: 1
the small wooden: 1
wooden stool in: 1
roof and um: 1
no matter how: 1
the ground supporting: 1
your unconscious mind: 1
unfinished business with: 1
face this is: 1
middle of an: 1
promptly fell over: 1
triple reverse mulhanney: 1
well everything a: 1
lord than any: 1
show everyone that: 1
you when you're: 1
a sea of: 1
face but he: 1
trying to sort: 1
or some such: 1
suggesting that it: 1
quality not quite: 1
put them lower: 1
voice was unsteady: 1
a ravenclaw i'm: 1
i thought it: 1
were being gentle: 1
harry dumbledore would: 1
that black killed: 1
- that i: 1
way around but: 1
of his best: 1
was a dignity: 1
and um i: 1
it hurt worse: 1
voice crisp with: 1
went after peter: 1
i understand harry: 1
wouldn't have thought: 1
of harry's knowledge: 1
pulled off a: 1
hand across his: 1
of something creative: 1
you were in: 1
walls but i: 1
i don't think: 1
he held you: 1
extended discourse on: 1
entirely it was: 1
any unfinished business: 1
life or something: 1
to have wicked: 1
feather-falling potion knowing: 1
the risk harry: 1
side all through: 1
and let go: 1
ask the critical: 1
had to be: 1
and it seems: 1
black have any: 1
bit of peter: 1
nervous gesture harry: 1
all thought they: 1
man set harry: 1
you have time: 1
watch besides myself: 1
that he'd been: 1
to waste the: 1
see anything of: 1
there would have: 1
though black was: 1
just been no: 1
but it's not: 1
formal robes were: 1
said harry that: 1
that also make: 1
jinxing you gently: 1
shouldn't be -: 1
did feel really: 1
robes that was: 1
and that both: 1
in his own: 1
started to feel: 1
you could mr: 1
something creative he: 1
harry's mouth had: 1
true to say: 1
of questions for: 1
didn't remember knew: 1
him as well: 1
long moment for: 1
to gryffindor remus's: 1
word that didn't: 1
as harry had: 1
that direction harry: 1
couldn't really see: 1
he knew the: 1
that way i: 1
every ravenclaw girl: 1
lupin who is: 1
available to slow: 1
to finish the: 1
grew out of: 1
his talents to: 1
themselves up from: 1
sentient beings the: 1
he just being: 1
it is it: 1
eyebrows have you: 1
trying to control: 1
am glad harry: 1
get burned at: 1
nonsmile of his: 1
thought they were: 1
voice must have: 1
didn't mean to: 1
sort out what: 1
extra backspin the: 1
wands out mr: 1
man - mr: 1
glittering in his: 1
the ground -: 1
time ago a: 1
the cold cold: 1
himself thought her: 1
and find that: 1
look at his: 1
met harry studied: 1
you or saw: 1
wild even some: 1
hermione said they're: 1
means i do: 1
that i want: 1
his brain noticed: 1
all when we: 1
gentle oh consider: 1
or something like: 1
about you couldn't: 1
harry okay you: 1
sorted into slytherin: 1
friends if you're: 1
that wry smile: 1
were of low: 1
over the age: 1
had instantly agreed: 1
the heart to: 1
for the loss: 1
going on here: 1
have thought it: 1
wry smile appeared: 1
as a friend: 1
making tragedy for: 1
smile appeared again: 1
a few hours: 1
mr potter said: 1
to mention a: 1
creative he could: 1
heart to squash: 1
that came to: 1
you have any: 1
it's romantic they: 1
risk was real: 1
do on purpose: 1
should not say: 1
would look at: 1
have remembered that: 1
i ask a: 1
doing the right: 1
done and buried: 1
himself would just: 1
swept his hair: 1
said harry i: 1
water glittering in: 1
hyperventilating and it: 1
someone else who: 1
went wild even: 1
find the heart: 1
was an awkward: 1
then the dark: 1
with your conscious: 1
remus i don't: 1
going harry had: 1
was my father's: 1
your fall afterward: 1
you shouldn't be: 1
know what this: 1
that harry couldn't: 1
on reading quietly: 1
they were lovers: 1
other good heavens: 1
to read not: 1
and then ah: 1
think of him: 1
harry would look: 1
harry had instantly: 1
draco he snorted: 1
he stopped in: 1
soon honestly said: 1
after a few: 1
been the most: 1
that if peter: 1
used to wonder: 1
question you can: 1
harry screwed up: 1
might have wanted: 1
then i thought: 1
instead of running: 1
it seems -: 1
mind and despite: 1
seriously do you: 1
secret and if: 1
his face but: 1
though thank you: 1
lupin's concern had: 1
it wasn't helping: 1
boy-who-lived gets draco: 1
harry and the: 1
sad affair ending: 1
but why are: 1
been no reason: 1
gently the man: 1
i should remember: 1
decision being made: 1
on trying to: 1
harry had read: 1
a long time: 1
in vast tragedy: 1
enough so he: 1
knowledge hermione was: 1
black wanted to: 1
absence of any: 1
harry had heard: 1
he should have: 1
an older slytherin: 1
lupin and then: 1
harry said his: 1
factors whether it: 1
own first encounter: 1
glancing in that: 1
passed he felt: 1
of harry's arm: 1
if they're ever: 1
to let me: 1
he grew out: 1
harry i'm a: 1
i changed a: 1
twenty-four hours and: 1
to feel ashamed: 1
i guess i: 1
tell me about: 1
downward again faster: 1
- remus's voice: 1
should vote on: 1
didn't mean hermione: 1
thought - not: 1
you're a hero: 1
did we meet: 1
choked up peter: 1
said quietly and: 1
books he wasn't: 1
cushioning feeling and: 1
the salt-and-pepper mustache: 1
visitors it means: 1
it would happen: 1
- the man's: 1
bothering house elves: 1
tipped him off: 1
life draco looked: 1
said a long: 1
should hear peter: 1
got james into: 1
feel the feather-falling: 1
what mr lupin: 1
but the older: 1
of not going: 1
and then the: 1
wasn't supposed to: 1
both of us: 1
go okay said: 1
it had all: 1
brief silence fell: 1
man helped him: 1
of it soon: 1
speak can you: 1
was worth black: 1
meet again someday: 1
realized possibly for: 1
lupin nodded harry: 1
remus said a: 1
be any muggle: 1
held you or: 1
adult friendship until: 1
clothes and faintly: 1
okay you do: 1
harry said poor: 1
said remus i: 1
and if he'd: 1
sure he got: 1
hidden - a: 1
a tall order: 1
vast tragedy or: 1
and harry potter: 1
and she'd started: 1
a thing to: 1
me it seems: 1
that was the: 1
his hyperventilating and: 1
in the patronus: 1
face who was: 1
to say the: 1
style and wanted: 1
i can guess: 1
of an extended: 1
harry hermione had: 1
have already met: 1
the faintly scarred: 1
he snorted girls: 1
back to 7pm: 1
wanted so much: 1
grass good heavens: 1
time in a: 1
to this little: 1
ones said harry: 1
after that whenever: 1
of the sky: 1
long since over: 1
obviously but that: 1
was the other: 1
hesitate harry may: 1
higher or put: 1
that would deflect: 1
brief wry look: 1
it from remus: 1
remaining one peter: 1
i guess you: 1
the dumb ones: 1
each other good: 1
that blood wasn't: 1
it to be: 1
individually i suppose: 1
had said when: 1
his head and: 1
either of them: 1
very seriously do: 1
to leap up: 1
up enough courage: 1
smile where did: 1
felt slightly bad: 1
enough to stop: 1
i do not: 1
pause remus gave: 1
said harry but: 1
harry had realized: 1
to control his: 1
noticed that he: 1
thirteen had voted: 1
the day that: 1
of mr lupin's: 1
to say that: 1
beginning when you: 1
happen and yet: 1
his life was: 1
feel ashamed of: 1
few hours said: 1
while remus was: 1
bit as scary: 1
that part -: 1
use this office: 1
left to be: 1
a little shocked: 1
white on the: 1
the house elves: 1
a bit of: 1
i've sort of: 1
skeptical they were: 1
parents he didn't: 1
of his life: 1
up no said: 1
i thought muggles: 1
- did my: 1
ah again he: 1
had seen from: 1
eyes but the: 1
him a sort: 1
him to hear: 1
desperately to orient: 1
say the only: 1
be all right: 1
it was that: 1
roof and made: 1
particular arms individually: 1
then harry would: 1
we meet said: 1
as well what: 1
cold remus's hand: 1
james and lily: 1
hadn't been sorted: 1
week and even: 1
you could know: 1
home life or: 1
guilty and b: 1
peter pettigrew harry: 1
girl while hermione: 1
it was obviously: 1
something about harry's: 1
more than one: 1
any muggle girls: 1
faces you've got: 1
despite that somehow: 1
out of it: 1
never seen the: 1
the death eaters: 1
day practically every: 1
got to let: 1
the man because: 1
in that direction: 1
hand scrabbled at: 1
stories remus lupin: 1
though it was: 1
stand by your: 1
mid-sentence was my: 1
he's just exhausted: 1
remus than anything: 1
been shaped to: 1
supporting him the: 1
of low quality: 1
supposed to resist: 1
harry's stomach tried: 1
all sometimes it: 1
they burn you: 1
who the faintly: 1
had passed he: 1
down two hundred: 1
small stone room: 1
besides myself said: 1
kept on reading: 1
up there just: 1
the factors whether: 1
it again if: 1
his last remaining: 1
seat on the: 1
a pause then: 1
from our school: 1
us begin at: 1
thank you to: 1
wasn't helping him: 1
wonders of james's: 1
harry couldn't have: 1
exact tone of: 1
shaped to enjoy: 1
worse to hear: 1
hide something flickered: 1
only the dumb: 1
be blinking rather: 1
sky harry remembered: 1
to resist the: 1
peter instead of: 1
gryffindor girl while: 1
no reason at: 1
stand between harry: 1
that it could: 1
all right after: 1
you're a girl: 1
him seek out: 1
the grass good: 1
the last thing: 1
why the hat: 1
said harry because: 1
at all times: 1
great doors of: 1
trap myself whatever: 1
that wasn't enough: 1
upright on the: 1
do know what: 1
sake of tragedy: 1
guess who the: 1
and begun screaming: 1
romantic hermione said: 1
all four of: 1
professor quirrell was: 1
that was just: 1
a lot of: 1
lupin's short desk: 1
soon enough where: 1
that strange gentle: 1
harry himself would: 1
there was no: 1
mention a few: 1
to the boy: 1
also make him: 1
- and this: 1
would just drop: 1
like people think: 1
scary as harry: 1
a strained voice: 1
i can tell: 1
but peter knew: 1
to feel a: 1
to make sure: 1
to sort out: 1
not important just: 1
that simple repair: 1
person who was: 1
eaters are not: 1
gasped the man: 1
ever need something: 1
muggles really do: 1
have reached the: 1
beneath the salt-and-pepper: 1
soon dawned on: 1
stone you could: 1
in less than: 1
voice shaking a: 1
of us have: 1
gryffindor remus's voice: 1
here temporarily to: 1
happen again -: 1
it was worth: 1
just something the: 1
remus gave a: 1
moment when harry: 1
first nervous gesture: 1
going but she: 1
why peter hadn't: 1
by fine and: 1
in any way: 1
started to say: 1
this is going: 1
poor home life: 1
one peter pettigrew: 1
have any extenuating: 1
peter pettigrew's story: 1
simple repair charms: 1
into hufflepuff since: 1
for a word: 1
never mind said: 1
professor quirrell didn't: 1
let go of: 1
quite tattered but: 1
extenuating circumstances harry: 1
that was when: 1
be there harry: 1
could feel the: 1
that way -: 1
said more seriously: 1
recognize it's true: 1
let us begin: 1
she'd started to: 1
toward the edge: 1
to calculate how: 1
apologize and it: 1
our wands out: 1
voice was choked: 1
the beginning when: 1
you too mr: 1
to slow him: 1
unsteady there was: 1
tragedy for the: 1
brave it does: 1
loss of his: 1
who worried about: 1
told the house: 1
- to which: 1
just being naturally: 1
he could speak: 1
generals ever heard: 1
he didn't remember: 1
something said harry: 1
you've got no: 1
small wooden desk: 1
to gasp professor: 1
the older man: 1
event and that: 1
pettigrew even if: 1
we might meet: 1
easy to stand: 1
good use and: 1
elves specifically it: 1
fingers white on: 1
elves in the: 1
but i had: 1
remus miss dinner: 1
courage to ask: 1
we uh a: 1
of lurching cushioning: 1
with your unconscious: 1
strained voice just: 1
he did it: 1
fast enough never: 1
of james's quidditch: 1
best friends in: 1
know and then: 1
was to be: 1
meant to have: 1
rather silly whoever: 1
risk harry he: 1
he was against: 1
fell over the: 1
girls might have: 1
the direction harry's: 1
while part of: 1
voice turning sad: 1
day that black: 1
hermione was beginning: 1
harry didn't smile: 1
- no harry: 1
all the girls: 1
that long since: 1
tried to summon: 1
seriously if it: 1
heaps on the: 1
to 7pm later: 1
possibly for the: 1
are you doing: 1
some number of: 1
it was part: 1
kicking in starting: 1
yeah said draco: 1
casts such a: 1
to summon mr: 1
the great doors: 1
harry let me: 1
when harry could: 1
it seems like: 1
he said nothing: 1
concerns are misplaced: 1
to have draco: 1
boys wow daphne: 1
the critical question: 1
do if you: 1
you think it: 1
lovers weren't they: 1
to remus lupin: 1
was available to: 1
girls had given: 1
that mr lupin: 1
and a tiny: 1
feeling and then: 1
lupin had lost: 1
to believe that: 1
not murder said: 1
pregnant said harry: 1
front of mr: 1
he couldn't help: 1
strength alone you: 1
than one adult: 1
draco i understand: 1
exactly what tipped: 1
of expectant female: 1
than gravity -: 1
to which harry: 1
dumbledore would tell: 1
the outcome though: 1
been obtained by: 1
on it -: 1
being there would: 1
helped him rise: 1
done the man: 1
peter so adored: 1
almost couldn't talk: 1
hurts to think: 1
a hand across: 1
said his voice: 1
be right objected: 1
weren't they there: 1
thing now by: 1
was holding harry: 1
sorry remus raised: 1
a small stone: 1
remus said slowly: 1
girls now lying: 1
to be you: 1
a happy story: 1
said poor home: 1
james petunia and: 1
injured sir said: 1
um i kinda: 1
would tell none: 1
way - and: 1
we all thought: 1
was just something: 1
the most difficult: 1
sudden leap of: 1
i'm a young: 1
and you would: 1
wry look crossed: 1
why black went: 1
didn't use those: 1
been black who: 1
girls left she'd: 1
on suggesting that: 1
did you hear: 1
without it glowing: 1
by being efficient: 1
or use this: 1
him that couldn't: 1
scarred face was: 1
time she wouldn't: 1
mean hermione was: 1
first place had: 1
had lost all: 1
face professor quirrell: 1
idea what sort: 1
but i can: 1
arms of all: 1
already sorry remus: 1
maybe ravenclaw because: 1
the risk was: 1
man's voice was: 1
powerful casts such: 1
any possible way: 1
about the direction: 1
general fact of: 1
off the roof: 1
constantly glancing in: 1
his body tried: 1
he'd never seen: 1
girl over the: 1
ask certainly harry: 1
stayed by james: 1
time it was: 1
and i understood: 1
pettigrew harry said: 1
difficult nonsmile of: 1
remus raised his: 1
have wicked stepparents: 1
worried about the: 1
appropriate so she'd: 1
to do if: 1
potter said professor: 1
personal question you: 1

them lower other: 1
not to waste: 1
touch his wand: 1
there is something: 1
a number of: 1
roof in a: 1
quietly his formal: 1
thought muggles hated: 1
doesn't that also: 1
into it really: 1
remus said his: 1
would make him: 1
professor quirrell had: 1
a seat on: 1
boy said remus: 1
man i should: 1
that didn't raise: 1
young for them: 1
pettigrew there'd just: 1
neither of her: 1
amused harry had: 1
potion knowing it: 1
enough courage to: 1
and faintly scarred: 1
man i changed: 1
into the same: 1
a few quibbler: 1

she'd said that: 1
of time in: 1
actually did start: 1
you doing this: 1
really see the: 1
- only the: 1
tragedy or so: 1

to be a: 1
the man had: 1
azkaban remus finished: 1

malfoy pregnant said: 1
twice at that: 1
and b worried: 1
the shrieking of: 1
to us all: 1

to be creative: 1
do hate that: 1
drop harry hermione: 1
after peter instead: 1
are misplaced no: 1
anything he'd ever: 1
office much and: 1
of something true: 1

he felt slightly: 1
as though black: 1
to notice harry: 1
dive with extra: 1
he must have: 1
you yourself i: 1
up though thank: 1
that whenever he: 1
sounding amused harry: 1

on purpose than: 1
long or use: 1
and proud it's: 1
anything that would: 1

temporarily to instruct: 1
and made a: 1
from remus than: 1
tone of nervousness: 1
awkward pause remus: 1
not supposed to: 1
us doesn't that: 1
hollow said the: 1
amid half the: 1
matter how powerful: 1
harry upright on: 1
was still trying: 1
shadow fell over: 1
secrets he couldn't: 1
him to hide: 1
remus lupin who: 1
by accident isn't: 1
slow grave nod: 1
to ask the: 1
he sounded a: 1
her fall off: 1
godric's hollow said: 1
proud it's easy: 1
they were being: 1

he wasn't even: 1
that somehow there: 1
again if you: 1
unhappy puzzlement was: 1
that being there: 1
young boy i'm: 1
a way that: 1
wasn't even going: 1
you were born: 1

and expensive robes: 1
mr lupin said: 1
he didn't use: 1
female faces you've: 1
would not have: 1
done it but: 1
or just thought: 1
while so this: 1
your conscious mind: 1
matter like a: 1
said draco but: 1
draco malfoy pregnant: 1
fall afterward and: 1
know that i: 1
of hogwarts hermione: 1

james's quidditch that: 1
and that was: 1
stopped in mid-sentence: 1
may i ask: 1
if you have: 1

it glowing gold: 1
friends in less: 1
like there isn't: 1
frank's boy said: 1
of his last: 1

face but i: 1
you tell me: 1
nasty cold remus's: 1
days harry couldn't: 1
in starting to: 1
so adored secrets: 1
you know about: 1
head and said: 1
was plain on: 1
their style and: 1
of any possible: 1
married in secret: 1
the temptation of: 1
holding harry he's: 1
crossed remus's face: 1
such harry wasn't: 1
short desk thank: 1
in the first: 1
held the roof: 1
imagined we might: 1
that i mean: 1
i see it: 1
his hair back: 1
to wonder why: 1
then thank you: 1
know why black: 1
the only other: 1
suppose i could: 1
moment when harry's: 1
lupin said he: 1
the exact tone: 1
something flickered in: 1
sparked the sudden: 1
hear harry dumbledore: 1
from up there: 1
they get burned: 1
harry thought -: 1
for saving me: 1
harry couldn't see: 1
if you think: 1
the most brave: 1
ever felt himself: 1
of the dark: 1
at harry for: 1
whisper i am: 1
out of the: 1
he might think: 1
if peter had: 1
every now and: 1
hit the ground: 1
a hero like: 1
the boy who: 1
you've got to: 1
calculation weighing the: 1
a fair number: 1
again faster than: 1
a script you've: 1
directly and that: 1
shook his head: 1
harry fell there: 1
how much time: 1
parents harry said: 1
in secret and: 1
to hear it: 1
mouth had already: 1
james into it: 1
of peter in: 1
unfamiliar man holding: 1
gold for a: 1
remus's hand swept: 1
them said draco: 1
i think harry: 1
face that strange: 1
helped in any: 1
turned out well: 1
harry but i: 1
yourself i see: 1
remaining-time calculation before: 1
ask a personal: 1
had known it: 1
couldn't find the: 1
got whoever was: 1
a lightning calculation: 1
cold cold stone: 1
a personal question: 1
who i think: 1
i'm a ravenclaw: 1
read a fair: 1
day the man's: 1
and each other: 1
squash more directly: 1
was desperately trying: 1
quietly and very: 1
just wanted to: 1
face was pinched: 1
heavens gasped the: 1
have four michael: 1
no said an: 1
was afraid he: 1
to understand because: 1
ground supporting him: 1
and harry fell: 1
even going to: 1
we all wanted: 1
heavens said the: 1
the while harry: 1
thing before -: 1
out mr pettigrew: 1
studied the man: 1
already opened and: 1
that it was: 1
have done it: 1
of nervousness in: 1
said no thank: 1
start seeing her: 1
said i want: 1
not important harry: 1
look crossed remus's: 1
shabby was the: 1
beneath adult friendship: 1
seemed to be: 1
they had been: 1
actually said harry: 1
he would find: 1
lightning calculation weighing: 1
while harry carefully: 1
minutes had passed: 1
mr lupin wouldn't: 1
terrified grip his: 1
isn't any possible: 1
mildly disappointed it: 1
thing to tell: 1
he'd done something: 1
hoped neither of: 1
the man seemed: 1
crowd went wild: 1
if you could: 1
hermione didn't recognize: 1
about peter pettigrew: 1
crisp with disapproval: 1
and sighed i: 1
remus's voice cut: 1
neville longbottom alice: 1
house elves not: 1
am told that: 1
quirrell he'll be: 1
looked quite uncomfortable: 1
but it had: 1
to show everyone: 1
that simple though: 1
whether it was: 1
doing this harry's: 1
even after that: 1
fall into the: 1
finger on exactly: 1
standing just outside: 1
the details from: 1
she desperately hoped: 1
them a script: 1
the falling body: 1
disapproval some number: 1
lying in heaps: 1
talents to good: 1
between harry and: 1
made up no: 1
shabby harry had: 1
on exactly what: 1
mr potter to: 1
other hand scrabbled: 1
you for coming: 1
though i am: 1
had already opened: 1
controlling his voice: 1
remus lupin had: 1
at all sometimes: 1
harry that wry: 1
if you were: 1
quirrell i introduce: 1
before - only: 1
you well my: 1
and despite that: 1
should be but: 1
fingers failed and: 1
nothing what about: 1
you had to: 1
finished his voice: 1
sounding a little: 1
the old-looking clothes: 1
about harry's voice: 1
since to the: 1
harry took a: 1
had soon dawned: 1
the only non-hufflepuff: 1
much and so: 1
been gravely injured: 1
gravity - harry's: 1
were things going: 1
gave a slow: 1
harry could feel: 1
had voted to: 1
where he'd fallen: 1
vote on it: 1
a lesson in: 1
harry himself thought: 1
unfamiliar man who: 1
the man helped: 1
said that he'd: 1
hermione was still: 1
or saw lily: 1
of humility but: 1
help but think: 1
was the unfamiliar: 1
friend and it: 1
is good to: 1
and harry promptly: 1
tell it again: 1
was choked to: 1
not to mention: 1
word that came: 1
use those secrets: 1
been misplaced considering: 1
as a young: 1
for a little: 1
her not a: 1
not going harry: 1
heard about you: 1
and the girls: 1
and put his: 1
man he of: 1
of them finally: 1
don't think he: 1
you for saving: 1
things to the: 1
voice just stupidity: 1
because peter so: 1
us where you: 1
thought her qualms: 1
you have a: 1
hadn't mentioned that: 1
with extra backspin: 1
please sit down: 1
his fingers white: 1
and so he'd: 1
harry had thought: 1
who is -: 1
if you ever: 1
all turned out: 1
of harry's intuition: 1
last remaining one: 1
with disapproval some: 1
to slow your: 1
down harry the: 1
age of thirteen: 1
did not understand: 1
he'd known it: 1
was the word: 1
was fierce now: 1
ravenclaw girls had: 1
of you it: 1
remus's face but: 1
hard i that: 1
afraid he might: 1
happy that he: 1
for that voice: 1
have a lot: 1
preparedness mr potter: 1
resist them he: 1
swallow hard several: 1
to bother house: 1
heard of humility: 1
he of the: 1
up from the: 1
direction harry the: 1
in mid-sentence was: 1
too young for: 1
someday i didn't: 1
searched for a: 1
older man shook: 1
girls now picking: 1
here that she: 1
was the thing: 1
than twenty-four hours: 1
something true to: 1
think harry that: 1
if it wasn't: 1
the remaining-time calculation: 1
satisfied modesty of: 1
no thank you: 1
so much to: 1
which was justice: 1
harry are your: 1
effort it said: 1
student in first-year: 1
professor quirrell he'll: 1
understood why the: 1
ground - harry: 1
of the old-looking: 1
must have reached: 1
it does harry: 1
to squash more: 1
last thing he'd: 1
didn't expect it: 1
again making sure: 1
was obviously fair: 1
desk and harry: 1
and lily and: 1
ago a sad: 1
friend and she'd: 1
his voice turning: 1
i wouldn't have: 1
suspicion but he: 1
suspect that there: 1
balanced himself and: 1
a bit please: 1
gravely injured sir: 1
hear the shrieking: 1
boy i'm a: 1
way the man: 1
tell none of: 1
just thought of: 1
made his fingers: 1
it said that: 1
then - yeah: 1
insisted that there: 1
answer he was: 1
death eaters made: 1
must do it: 1
said when you're: 1
seemed to us: 1
she'd kept on: 1
his face professor: 1
front of his: 1
shock on his: 1
reflexively terrified grip: 1
slow your fall: 1
harry definitely for: 1
reason at all: 1
thirty minutes had: 1
and said not: 1
that death eaters: 1
harry in his: 1
glad harry that: 1
have fit with: 1
was justice draco: 1
what sort of: 1
that i thought: 1
he wiped a: 1
remembered that faintly: 1
the absence of: 1
would find out: 1
that faintly scarred: 1
older slytherin girl: 1
that voice shaking: 1
thought - to: 1
more seriously if: 1
have wanted to: 1
mr lupin's concern: 1
hero like godric: 1
foreseen it myself: 1
there's someone else: 1
help it it: 1
by denying sentient: 1
standing beside him: 1
a person that: 1
a brief wry: 1
lupin was sitting: 1
myself said professor: 1
to good use: 1
plain on his: 1
at hogwarts for: 1

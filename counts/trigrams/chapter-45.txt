potter that dementors: 1
and sometimes what: 1

students were just: 1
harry for his: 1
harry had not: 1
dementor just the: 1
a different sort: 1
uncontrolled fusion reactions: 1
born on earth: 1
a deep breath: 1
doing wrong before: 1

last harry lowered: 1
i can by: 1
well protecting him: 1

i suppose dumbledore: 1

of relief or: 1
on hold for: 1
quirrell looked puzzled: 1
harry said about: 1
to be born: 1
a slight glitter: 1
of the song: 1
from where he: 1
harry was fine: 1
why people would: 1
radiant that harry: 1
wand rose up: 1
its kiss would: 1
auror butnaru who: 1
the right distances: 1
was looking at: 1
all around him: 1
for a dementor: 1
unseeable horror still: 1
said i wouldn't: 1
side effect rather: 1
her a mother's: 1
the dementor's direction: 1
death not while: 1
what i was: 1
of the dementor: 1
the beginning stance: 1
about fear so: 1
know that their: 1
as harry poured: 1
alive again that: 1
some level albus: 1
this earned him: 1
you at hogwarts: 1
for it was: 1
an appalled pause: 1
didn't seem important: 1
all concerned the: 1
teach himself to: 1
was only a: 1
said suppose the: 1
a test i: 1
refuses to see: 1
a little look: 1
wasn't about something: 1
wavering voice are: 1
the ones i: 1
things the books: 1
said dryly the: 1
the lucky and: 1
nuisances like dementors: 1
at him they: 1
knew what they: 1
people knew what: 1
it dumbledore said: 1
much darkness to: 1
through him he: 1
i'm pretty sure: 1
bright figure of: 1
ron weasley put: 1
persuasive either i: 1
which simplified the: 1
into its power: 1
the dementor harry: 1
the phoenix put: 1
learned reflex to: 1
into the right: 1
the hole in: 1
approached and the: 1
were intakes of: 1
look harry said: 1
the true answer: 1
if i can: 1
desiring to know: 1
say that if: 1
from it i: 1
look upon harry: 1
friends coaxing draco: 1
dementor it wouldn't: 1
hear the excited: 1
understandable emotions of: 1
there were other: 1
brighter and yet: 1
that had happened: 1
enough riddle once: 1
someday understanding that: 1
mishap occurring to: 1
to what lay: 1
things that had: 1
could be hurt: 1
weren't afraid but: 1
remained only harry: 1
homo sapiens the: 1
shield of sparkling: 1
an ancient device: 1
the excited questions: 1
a creature of: 1
came and spoke: 1
as it hung: 1
harry with narrowed: 1
that it knew: 1
take my place: 1
to hogwarts when: 1
the argument went: 1
points of light: 1
now knew to: 1
auror goryanof's face: 1
universe the absence: 1
time to play: 1
is a certain: 1
you are a: 1
and the video: 1
like they'd just: 1
the defense professor: 1
headmaster harry said: 1
it did not: 1
enough why people: 1
was obvious harry: 1
boy-who-lived could also: 1
through which warmth: 1
a dementor it: 1
that too was: 1
his spell blazing: 1
she honestly didn't: 1
a dementor the: 1
that art still: 1
out that dean: 1
had been worn: 1
all happy thoughts: 1
flitwick looked at: 1
anywhere near the: 1
of pure fear: 1
the dementor couldn't: 1
is not the: 1
to herd the: 1
added the missing: 1
said still alive: 1
stood directly before: 1
fear was the: 1
what is the: 1
graciously harry said: 1
existed the figure: 1
students back to: 1
you thought about: 1
so they'd concluded: 1
needed to take: 1
were sheltered from: 1
of the tiny: 1
might be that: 1
blaze even brighter: 1
of that could: 1
clear enough why: 1
is not something: 1
harry observed this: 1
a side effect: 1
incandescent light brighter: 1
hermione he said: 1
seemed like a: 1
me said professor: 1
the dementor could: 1
her eyes harry: 1
descendants of humanity: 1
would have been: 1
certain look about: 1
had let the: 1
was the boy: 1
trump card i: 1
are a shadow: 1
at harry with: 1
and walked away: 1
video the earth: 1
would use to: 1
inside him to: 1
not so being: 1
the universe the: 1
to say no: 1
walked away toward: 1
all of that: 1
carefully filius flitwick: 1
childish thing that: 1
dumbledore and an: 1
life had come: 1
chance at casting: 1
the word echoed: 1
only this time: 1
once existed the: 1
within himself all: 1
react to that: 1
quietly well if: 1
all looking at: 1
beyond the first: 1
surged down his: 1
breath from the: 1
worn into his: 1
that had passed: 1
they were all: 1
the same patronus: 1
him and the: 1
know you now: 1
dementors were only: 1
sharp they do: 1
wherever i tried: 1
was studying him: 1
roused himself for: 1
use to destroy: 1
case i see: 1
staring i think: 1
accuse you falsely: 1
pieces and elements: 1
shadow of death: 1
of the darkness: 1
their own degree: 1
a little the: 1
to fear but: 1
him like they'd: 1
seeing harry writhing: 1
own pain and: 1
was the problem: 1
that out loud: 1
she had been: 1
the world harry: 1
was still in: 1
mcgonagall was looking: 1
so there was: 1
dementor screaming a: 1
little nuisances paling: 1
out all his: 1
on shape and: 1
of the lucky: 1
professor quirrell it's: 1
little look harry: 1
and fawkes was: 1
use a different: 1
had used half: 1
said to fawkes: 1
see a naked: 1
like dementors mum: 1
not reach through: 1
looks and then: 1
showing no fright: 1
a refuge for: 1
it turned out: 1
were the only: 1
at harry and: 1
studying him carefully: 1
lay empty within: 1
tiniest smidgin of: 1
like a breaking: 1
that which had: 1
of what it: 1
he'd tried to: 1
large after all: 1
a dementor fear: 1
has no effect: 1
so were sheltered: 1
came over you: 1
painful thought instead: 1
had returned to: 1
when he had: 1
of the world: 1
wrong before there's: 1
him something of: 1
coaxing draco out: 1
vaster future depended: 1
sneak off and: 1
comprehend your nature: 1
fusion reactions because: 1
gently trailed off: 1
fire it is: 1
when there came: 1
had realizing that: 1
all i can: 1
a breaking dam: 1
destroy everything that: 1
to awaken raised: 1
an auror trio: 1
number of girls: 1
a human being: 1
thought instead of: 1
me and that: 1
animals the animals: 1
outgrown and someday: 1
ravenclaw might also: 1
death opening all: 1
it and when: 1
are sorted into: 1
drain through which: 1
concerned and professor: 1
while fawkes was: 1
me to harry: 1
ravenclaw door asked: 1
the starting position: 1
it back excuse: 1
called upon all: 1
thing to do: 1
the much vaster: 1
the garage to: 1
understanding that the: 1
dreamlike state remembered: 1
respond - it: 1
refuge for you: 1
could be true: 1
him to do: 1
thought harry that: 1
at him something: 1
and the memory: 1
horror on auror: 1
closeness drained your: 1
him put his: 1
from the cage: 1
the power of: 1
it okay this: 1
are undying they: 1
brighter and brighter: 1
figure with two: 1
the girl gazed: 1
to destroy an: 1
that wasn't about: 1
without a patronus: 1
chance of a: 1
you didn't hear: 1
the headmaster keeps: 1
upon to put: 1
days of dawn: 1
is borrowed from: 1
boy and the: 1
possibility now i: 1
the world the: 1
opening his eyes: 1
be that he: 1
magic you are: 1
and the bright: 1
okay there ought: 1
the fading sunset: 1
weakening you you: 1
i think i'm: 1
unkillable not invincible: 1
thoughts about something: 1
everything that made: 1
see harry said: 1
out through him: 1
turned back hermione: 1
else was concerned: 1
have to do: 1
hogwarts when it: 1
they were hurt: 1
strength its kiss: 1
no hermione said: 1
alive in the: 1
briefly and that: 1
what they were: 1
art still those: 1
hung in space: 1
that had used: 1
come very close: 1
the argument harry: 1
of the you're: 1
mind the learned: 1
fear said the: 1
i am very: 1
still absentmindedly what: 1
thing that the: 1
warm happy thoughts: 1
appalled pause at: 1
and dean the: 1
than the fading: 1
touch the ones: 1
patronuses were animals: 1
as it would: 1
is so horrible: 1
of shock it: 1
right though then: 1
necessary quirinus there: 1
nothing there to: 1
go away it: 1
said minerva before: 1
my place and: 1
narrowed eyes that: 1
similar mishap occurring: 1
right frame of: 1
there ought to: 1
what to say: 1
the path that: 1
harry thought of: 1
him everyone that: 1
and desiring to: 1
sunlight as it: 1
shoulder at least: 1
would it be: 1
remember seeing harry: 1
any more the: 1
would help them: 1
back to hogwarts: 1
glowing brighter and: 1
or sighs of: 1
to do that: 1
everything humanity was: 1
tried really harry: 1
phoenix was still: 1
apologize all i: 1
worry about that: 1
up with him: 1
be true rivals: 1
the phoenix was: 1
would have fought: 1
saw it as: 1
dream like opening: 1
and professor flitwick: 1
up harry said: 1
phoenix put aside: 1
now than the: 1
each other at: 1
the peace faded: 1
precise voice i: 1
fear weakening you: 1
is not so: 1
a final time: 1
it is good: 1
you need more: 1
echoing in his: 1
near the dementor: 1
of hogwarts a: 1
to himself if: 1
that could be: 1
water in her: 1
say thank you: 1
setting sun fawkes: 1
even in the: 1
the aurors and: 1
shock it produced: 1
not name here: 1
drew forth his: 1
else learn the: 1
it was an: 1
wouldn't exactly be: 1
harry puzzled looks: 1
giving him very: 1
white light light: 1
for later while: 1
the video the: 1
of what he: 1
you saw it: 1
else its meaning: 1
dumbledore you would: 1
that all the: 1
tiny handful of: 1
with little nuisances: 1
history of ancient: 1
dementors can actually: 1
looked straight at: 1
very sorry to: 1
clever plan for: 1
not invincible and: 1
seen the pictures: 1
more the wand: 1
harry said quietly: 1
harry said i'd: 1
harry said i'm: 1
the field and: 1
verged on the: 1
and so were: 1
believe miss ransom: 1
behind professor flitwick: 1
back to look: 1
wrong the defense: 1
beneath the tall: 1
held off the: 1
death touch the: 1
it's just a: 1
and this is: 1
me down someday: 1
say no one: 1
the sun would: 1
now in the: 1
even close you: 1
slowly move toward: 1
harry took in: 1
time harry added: 1
them as they: 1
dementors cannot be: 1
the song still: 1
it is not: 1
over it and: 1
around him harry: 1
the fear weakening: 1
there is a: 1
faint it seems: 1
made life worth: 1
earned him something: 1
that image because: 1
just seen him: 1
move toward the: 1
by dementors the: 1
straight toward the: 1
about what happens: 1
when harry had: 1
a wavering voice: 1
did not overcome: 1
significant made them: 1
edges off the: 1
said harry every: 1
even professor quirrell: 1
by four patronuses: 1
would collapse a: 1
had passed through: 1
to star no: 1
the children about: 1
back hermione he: 1
breath from all: 1
fear it didn't: 1
peace which annoyed: 1
least harry was: 1
of ancient earth: 1
honestly didn't need: 1
the phoenix still: 1
space the open: 1
rigid showing no: 1
think a warm: 1
a head standing: 1
ever draw upon: 1
pound of spare: 1
reach through your: 1
again even in: 1
him looking very: 1
him destroy a: 1
with narrowed eyes: 1
flee and discover: 1
mantled his wings: 1
don't mind if: 1
in the phoenix's: 1
the wound in: 1
looking like he: 1
who actually said: 1
they left turned: 1
had bought him: 1
felt the fear: 1
did here now: 1
his wand burst: 1
always be a: 1
the ground and: 1
but i'm guessing: 1
this it seemed: 1
and meanwhile there: 1
him that his: 1
and four times: 1
would someday colonize: 1
the headmaster the: 1
i'm guessing the: 1
led back to: 1
unlikely mr potter: 1
his wand twitched: 1
be alive if: 1
to happen right: 1
the phoenix lingered: 1
beside her was: 1
out and sometimes: 1
at them as: 1
instead fawkes's piercing: 1
card an elaborate: 1
actually said that: 1
rowena ravenclaw might: 1
man painful to: 1
fear but fear: 1
that they would: 1
the bright figure: 1
or else learn: 1
do not possess: 1
i can say: 1
would destroy everything: 1
death through some: 1
guess but i'm: 1
how to respond: 1
hearts held their: 1
avoid mischances with: 1
him mum's smile: 1
and someday when: 1
dumbledore was staring: 1
tattered cloak lay: 1
structure they have: 1
at him professor: 1
had ever once: 1
dangerous and destructive: 1
dementor headmaster harry: 1
day card an: 1
is not a: 1
about the history: 1
beep a little: 1
of cheering no: 1
standing upright the: 1
at the other: 1
directly before the: 1
to face reality: 1
say fear said: 1
to know what: 1
all right said: 1
they're old enough: 1
and spoke to: 1
four times as: 1
the you're completely: 1
the look of: 1
i think so: 1
children's children's children: 1
willing to go: 1
being aware of: 1
when the descendants: 1
charm within his: 1
empty within the: 1
now if she: 1
won't cower in: 1
to see it: 1
shielding their eyes: 1
let me try: 1
worth living his: 1
to do about: 1
can actually talk: 1
red and gold: 1
a great piercing: 1
just plain staring: 1
away all happy: 1
almost said minerva: 1
quirrell that it: 1
while i have: 1
that the boy-who-lived: 1
see an answer: 1
anything i can: 1
ancient earth as: 1
more than uncontrolled: 1
said firmly as: 1
was what made: 1
to hide his: 1
the open drain: 1
around harry's head: 1
door asked you: 1
and even running: 1
up from where: 1
flitwick looking like: 1
shape blaze even: 1
almost absentmindedly and: 1
could also be: 1
exactly be comforting: 1
answer people understood: 1
to feel guilty: 1
prove persuasive either: 1
so harry would: 1
a dementor just: 1
no of course: 1
and they stood: 1
if she was: 1
blazing with incandescent: 1
were other students: 1
a rationalist needs: 1
watch harry's eyes: 1
cloak that was: 1
as they now: 1
of gryffindor were: 1
also be hurt: 1
shape and substance: 1
and magic and: 1
thinking warm happy: 1
professor quirrell looked: 1
had to put: 1
children's children the: 1
death had ever: 1
with two arms: 1
request met with: 1
work hard on: 1
as his wand: 1
dementor seeming to: 1
all his strength: 1
his head it: 1
brighter you are: 1
reflected sunlight as: 1
mistake the dementor: 1
tried to teach: 1
his father had: 1
been cheering or: 1
said harry shook: 1
starting positions he: 1
i will be: 1
attacking a wound: 1
his mind again: 1
harry shook his: 1
said finally staring: 1
burst from it: 1
said i'm pretty: 1
that hermione was: 1
at hogwarts what: 1
into the world: 1
simplified the argument: 1
words mild the: 1
looking very worried: 1
glancing nervously at: 1
into nothing harry: 1
everyone was staring: 1
miss ransom was: 1
their hearts held: 1
rather than the: 1
ron weasley of: 1
from the fear: 1
the end it: 1
what it meant: 1
first but harry: 1
him desecrate it: 1
living his wand: 1
dawn when there: 1
pointed out that: 1
if you do: 1
a wild guess: 1
his face was: 1
and just like: 1
away from the: 1
and without really: 1
the black void: 1
patronus on some: 1
strength into his: 1
starting position for: 1
misconception thought harry: 1
it fear what: 1
all i doubt: 1
you would not: 1
you falsely mr: 1
many have tried: 1
and someday the: 1
the fear was: 1
am very sorry: 1
face then professor: 1
future depended on: 1
face the argument: 1
said professor quirrell: 1
protecting him as: 1
and white with: 1
nothingness in the: 1
be remembered someday: 1
or no there: 1
that everyone was: 1
was speaking harry: 1
feeling of a: 1
at the unseeable: 1
their own best: 1
two legs and: 1
wand twitched once: 1
plain staring i: 1
memory for all: 1
faster that they: 1
and then followed: 1
brilliant points of: 1
it knew me: 1
do harry said: 1
it's all right: 1
the painful thought: 1
professor flitwick made: 1
they were supposed: 1
lain on the: 1
that would someday: 1
his own do: 1
star no of: 1
into their starting: 1
terrible thoughts that: 1
an obvious enough: 1
gave harry puzzled: 1
was busy there: 1
twice thrice and: 1
head his face: 1
but it is: 1
like that it: 1
go anywhere near: 1
head it said: 1
in fear of: 1
it is a: 1
before managing to: 1
promise of the: 1
was part of: 1
dementor had made: 1
dementor so they: 1
blue sky and: 1
was concerned and: 1
bit of an: 1
song still alive: 1
look of shock: 1
professor quirrell shielding: 1
dementor's cage guarded: 1
fear that there: 1
adequate shield of: 1
was starting to: 1
what is impossible: 1
turned from harry: 1
blazing white light: 1
shook his head: 1
terrible things that: 1
there was an: 1
simple enough mistake: 1
taken him three: 1
intelligent life had: 1
might also have: 1
- and someday: 1
eyes that if: 1
albus dumbledore beside: 1
do about fear: 1
he would have: 1
pulled away from: 1
think professor quirrell: 1
substance a figure: 1
and elements of: 1
i have a: 1
rid of the: 1
hurt you felt: 1
all his defiance: 1
beginning stance for: 1
to anything had: 1
first answer people: 1
shoulder there were: 1
only a little: 1
dean thomas cast: 1
of dawn when: 1
or think the: 1
strongest virtue is: 1
turned to look: 1
which lay beneath: 1
which had been: 1
made of that: 1
right and everyone: 1
for the final: 1
tune and had: 1
thought about it: 1
what did they: 1
worst of it: 1
science i won't: 1
fear it exuded: 1
was keeping up: 1
black void and: 1
fear itself that: 1
the wand harry's: 1
hurt and wretched: 1
the problem so: 1
your strongest virtue: 1
harry thought as: 1
mind and magic: 1

within that image: 1
like dementors can: 1
the only virtue: 1
the learned reflex: 1

though to deny: 1
a kind of: 1
by the power: 1
isn't it's all: 1
harry sat up: 1
natural to think: 1
the phoenix puzzled: 1
would hunt me: 1
overcome all the: 1
what professor flitwick: 1
still willing to: 1
get over it: 1
the fear to: 1
said it's just: 1
at all the: 1
as though to: 1
to go away: 1
light that became: 1
with a certain: 1
have to say: 1
that i am: 1

harry said to: 1
so as they: 1
would always know: 1
faded away slowly: 1
thing as death: 1
waking up from: 1
and death is: 1
without flinching and: 1
straight at the: 1
the trio first: 1
never truly seen: 1
to look toward: 1
that they could: 1
they stood directly: 1
the unseeable horror: 1
at some point: 1
did not prove: 1
a dream like: 1
still those grooves: 1
brilliant now than: 1
gaze of warning: 1
then back at: 1
down his arm: 1
voice from behind: 1
it wouldn't exactly: 1
brighter than the: 1
of romance in: 1
everything it would: 1
fawkes what fawkes: 1
is impossible to: 1
animal homo sapiens: 1
would have much: 1
him and warmth: 1
faces turned to: 1
father had bought: 1
this even professor: 1
harry poured all: 1
and that would: 1
to stay behind: 1
the wand rose: 1
minerva mcgonagall was: 1
learn they'll weep: 1
would they still: 1
that silence again: 1
himself into the: 1
the fear it: 1
color and space: 1
any other possibility: 1
on his own: 1
each other's eyes: 1
starting harry looked: 1
beneath the setting: 1
argument went on: 1
patronuses if the: 1
hermione said back: 1
went on and: 1
worse than any: 1
to go anywhere: 1
but he'd seen: 1
i'd like to: 1
did they try: 1
dean the blue: 1
the earth was: 1
everything else its: 1
next that started: 1
thoughts like that: 1
happy thought remembered: 1
gaze moved away: 1
to him terrible: 1
mr potter just: 1
a shadow that: 1
his shoulder at: 1
being glowing brighter: 1
will ever embrace: 1
winter-blasted grass fawkes: 1
life worth living: 1
which suggested that: 1
not allow him: 1
look but then: 1
once you saw: 1
didn't seem likely: 1
hogwarts what did: 1
effect rather than: 1
would remember seeing: 1
sun fawkes cawed: 1
do that all: 1
hadn't seen the: 1
still perched on: 1
warning his head: 1
put aside the: 1
and they began: 1
sharp intakes of: 1
it was only: 1
mischances with wands: 1
the infinitesimal the: 1
just in case: 1
was the right: 1
screaming a great: 1
comforting to ask: 1
said dumbledore how: 1
draco's journey neville: 1
i see harry: 1
headmaster the words: 1
the fear hurt: 1
harry said this: 1
professor quirrell everyone's: 1
the horror far: 1
presence and ron: 1

grass fawkes still: 1
the earliest days: 1
it was a: 1
lucky and unlucky: 1
and temporary nuisances: 1
sometimes you have: 1
anything had the: 1
when they were: 1
professor flitwick had: 1
and before anyone: 1
in the light: 1
only auror butnaru: 1
glanced in the: 1
dementor even without: 1
so that when: 1
not prove persuasive: 1
himself to face: 1
the dementor at: 1
dementor's direction the: 1
and everything it: 1
or another sneak: 1
sure i know: 1
of that but: 1
kiss would destroy: 1
harry said it: 1
from a dream: 1
harry she hadn't: 1
it i suppose: 1
again that silence: 1
so radiant that: 1
had lain on: 1
and would never: 1
for obvious reasons: 1
was nothing there: 1
shone red and: 1
riddle what is: 1
feel the warmth: 1
shouldn't ought to: 1
it for a: 1
to forget by: 1
the animal homo: 1
i will not: 1
while but that: 1
like having its: 1
children the distant: 1
which professor quirrell: 1
bear it and: 1
writhing on the: 1
dementor what would: 1
so remained only: 1
and someday we'll: 1
cawed at him: 1
riddle and it: 1
of color and: 1
him slowly move: 1
everyone was giving: 1
she hadn't seen: 1
out that despite: 1
the light of: 1
made him desecrate: 1
course not the: 1
knew and would: 1
harry said calmly: 1
and said that: 1
promise that they: 1
fawkes told me: 1
world is healed: 1
be in the: 1
healed at last: 1
of an argument: 1
to be alive: 1
eyes sorry harry: 1
went back to: 1
reactions because it: 1
gryffindor yes said: 1
hard on a: 1
had almost held: 1
seem important i: 1
the boy-who-lived could: 1
curiosity wondering and: 1
the strength that: 1
very large after: 1
began to walk: 1
on dementors they: 1
minerva before managing: 1
professor mcgonagall came: 1
toward the painful: 1
where he had: 1
on ancient earth: 1
then she turned: 1
fingers slid exactly: 1
quirrell raised his: 1
said about what: 1
finally acceded since: 1
then leave she: 1
end it turned: 1
me try it: 1
if the fear: 1
who has to: 1
it's not like: 1
him you didn't: 1
was rigid showing: 1
the dementor would: 1
hurt could be: 1
harry and walked: 1
something of a: 1
elaborate thing that: 1
left who were: 1
the opposition despite: 1
thing that had: 1
at this even: 1
excited questions starting: 1
old enough to: 1
still in him: 1
obvious why the: 1
that had almost: 1
gazed into each: 1
test i would: 1
from something important: 1
was a simple: 1
did not like: 1
was ready now: 1
looked at him: 1
once twice thrice: 1
had come very: 1
slightly corroded cage: 1
and harry for: 1
and unlucky few: 1
be put on: 1
sparkling mist which: 1
himself if the: 1
to star they: 1
threw it into: 1
of all concerned: 1
try mr potter: 1
only ones left: 1
the day so: 1
away harry would: 1
there will always: 1
everyone else who: 1
hunt me down: 1
right now if: 1
of it so: 1
if there's anything: 1
stay behind professor: 1
head and then: 1
nuzzled his cheek: 1
fawkes cawed a: 1
dementor expecto patronum: 1
human shone more: 1
they would talk: 1
warm happy thought: 1
weasley of gryffindor: 1
cheering no one: 1
opposition despite the: 1
lowered his wand: 1
people won't have: 1
that the patronus: 1
harry's gaze moved: 1
it hung in: 1
end you i: 1
its closeness drained: 1
think the right: 1
put himself into: 1
stars the promise: 1
was wrong the: 1
flinching and though: 1
to put up: 1
were terrible things: 1
the only ones: 1
dumbledore's face the: 1
i doubt the: 1
undying said the: 1
who were still: 1
of vulnerability in: 1
light of that: 1
sorry harry said: 1
their own pain: 1
for all that: 1
not like having: 1
climbed to his: 1
houses this is: 1
garage to flash: 1
mr potter there: 1
and harry's eyes: 1
else to see: 1
to any other: 1
then professor quirrell: 1
around the field: 1
a certain extremely: 1
tell you mr: 1
was clear that: 1
human species has: 1
the shape of: 1
presence of a: 1
the setting sun: 1
ought to exist: 1
his eyes after: 1
quirrell headmaster dumbledore: 1
good to know: 1
i will ever: 1
remembered instead fawkes's: 1
so horrible that: 1
darkness to be: 1
in the universe: 1
lights and beep: 1
i won't cower: 1
it out again: 1
absence of color: 1

glitter of water: 1
anything else to: 1
i can do: 1
his trump card: 1
children about the: 1
possess eternal life: 1
in a deep: 1
feet and turned: 1
him carefully filius: 1
deep breath let: 1
if anything threatened: 1
you the fear: 1
made them more: 1
that didn't seem: 1
his shoulder there: 1
the pictures and: 1
makes it larger: 1
why the patronuses: 1
a mother's day: 1
mr potter said: 1
the sun is: 1
invincible and someday: 1
since it didn't: 1
didn't mean they'd: 1
eyes stared directly: 1
meant to stay: 1
finding out and: 1
wand harry's fingers: 1
earth blazing blue: 1
patronus up harry: 1
and a head: 1
out again yep: 1
her as they: 1
the students back: 1
kill fear it: 1
will be in: 1
how to apologize: 1
won't have to: 1
head swung to: 1
looked at them: 1
the best rationalists: 1
having its prey: 1
mummy rowena ravenclaw: 1
it is only: 1
put up an: 1
and harry observed: 1
mcgonagall telling him: 1
suggested that she: 1
of death opening: 1
direction the word: 1
harry said i: 1
phoenix lingered harry: 1
leveled straight at: 1
species has not: 1
passed through him: 1
for battle called: 1
significantly at dumbledore: 1
that the much: 1
of magic you: 1
variety though it: 1
positions he was: 1
if you weren't: 1
running faster that: 1
trailed off into: 1
from it as: 1
flitwick appeared tremendously: 1
fawkes was gone: 1
the missing ingredient: 1
you you wanted: 1
around and saw: 1
he was speaking: 1
he had lain: 1
like that didn't: 1
potter just in: 1
the ground screaming: 1
turned minerva mcgonagall: 1
at the phoenix: 1
cage he looked: 1
fawkes's song gently: 1
that it would: 1
but that didn't: 1
pause at this: 1
sun would it: 1
hole in the: 1
straight at that: 1
in him and: 1
you another will: 1
they won't tell: 1
peace faded a: 1
by thinking warm: 1
staring at harry: 1
like waking up: 1
right said auror: 1
every head swung: 1
happy thought that: 1
any more than: 1
hurriedly with a: 1
was confusion at: 1
to know the: 1
mind harry discarded: 1
that started a: 1
you felt the: 1
to faint it: 1
on and it: 1
another until the: 1
to be fought: 1
said fawkes cawed: 1
as blazing white: 1
insane variety though: 1
something i will: 1
into his mind: 1
draw upon to: 1
mastered that art: 1
indicates that your: 1
quirrell said firmly: 1
state remembered instead: 1
her afterward and: 1
sharp gaze of: 1
through some law: 1
hogwarts a number: 1
not unkillable not: 1
fear people knew: 1
a dementor on: 1
up within himself: 1
well if it: 1
the memory of: 1
sharp look but: 1
and fawkes nuzzled: 1
need more than: 1
as they strode: 1
cawed a final: 1
be hurt through: 1
the floodgates inside: 1
good way to: 1
also have known: 1
i love and: 1
didn't say it: 1
cloak lay empty: 1
collapse a moment: 1
would like to: 1
the boy and: 1
cry and roused: 1
there was confusion: 1
to the dementor's: 1
grooves had been: 1
with incandescent light: 1
know what i: 1
do this under: 1
was a certain: 1
everything that you: 1
harry's eyes went: 1
known for it: 1
leave she did: 1
four patronuses when: 1
would think a: 1
but fear itself: 1
guarded by four: 1
slight glitter of: 1
and know that: 1
supervision he may: 1
the more so: 1
at him you: 1
her and said: 1
sorting hat it: 1
void and the: 1
killed many have: 1
harry told her: 1
i comprehend your: 1
that dean thomas: 1
best rationalists are: 1
professor pointed out: 1
of a sharp: 1
voice i thought: 1
nature you symbolize: 1
harry thought to: 1
more than anything: 1
argument in which: 1
spell professor quirrell: 1
loud fawkes told: 1
effect on it: 1
perched on his: 1
flash of fire: 1
supposed to do: 1
another go at: 1
cower in fear: 1
a moment after: 1
the tiny handful: 1
but what lies: 1
yep harry said: 1
answer and this: 1
spell blazing with: 1
which concluded the: 1
but after a: 1
mcgonagall's voice from: 1
was and everything: 1
i will end: 1
lingered harry turned: 1
them someday understanding: 1
sat up from: 1
other at the: 1
fawkes still perched: 1
hermione was keeping: 1
charm could ever: 1
met with a: 1
behind him are: 1
breath let it: 1
you i will: 1
white bear again: 1
than uncontrolled fusion: 1
cry of defiance: 1
quirrell said dryly: 1
need to feel: 1
it shouldn't ought: 1
had made him: 1
to make that: 1
there was still: 1
something else harry: 1
you know it: 1
dryly the sun: 1
the right thing: 1
in its cage: 1
again all right: 1
talk or think: 1
what would you: 1
a figure with: 1
that didn't need: 1
said suppose you: 1
patronuses when there: 1
that their own: 1
arms two legs: 1
like he wanted: 1
light neville and: 1
awaken raised up: 1
can say that: 1
far worse than: 1
ravenclaw leaving none: 1
thought and harry's: 1
it didn't quite: 1
the gaze sharp: 1
a bit of: 1
rationalist needs sometimes: 1
fear of death: 1
students stay and: 1
not something i: 1
your own mind: 1
not invincible not: 1
the history of: 1
it as blazing: 1
eternal life they: 1
in the end: 1
off the phoenix's: 1
launched himself straight: 1
harry's fingers moved: 1
let the other: 1
it might be: 1
of girls gave: 1
patronus or no: 1
think the fear: 1
mother's day card: 1
quite fit once: 1
moved into their: 1
were i know: 1
thought of the: 1
the auror trio: 1
mind again all: 1
it belonged there: 1
at the shadow: 1
worked for him: 1
had happened to: 1
screaming and fawkes: 1
light brighter than: 1
that dementors cannot: 1
upright the animal: 1
his wings around: 1
a good time: 1
path that led: 1
of a similar: 1
the fear but: 1
to ask 'what: 1
suppose you threw: 1
puzzled but the: 1
have spread from: 1
beneath the tattered: 1
aurors were glancing: 1
even brighter and: 1
doubt the dementor: 1
never amount to: 1
remaining peace which: 1
would talk later: 1
about that professor: 1
word echoed in: 1
in a wavering: 1
i know how: 1
patronum the thought: 1
at last harry: 1
more so as: 1
certain amount of: 1
the galaxy and: 1
this riddle what: 1
you wanted the: 1
said calmly he'd: 1
was a flash: 1
earth was what: 1
had been pulled: 1
but harry couldn't: 1
it though it: 1
he'd put off: 1
only a slight: 1
speaking harry said: 1
mind and all: 1
try it okay: 1
their starting positions: 1
close you had: 1
through your patronus: 1
of the peace: 1
more brilliant now: 1
absence of cheering: 1
handful of sentient: 1
and discover their: 1
remembered all bright: 1
ransom was up: 1
left but somehow: 1
happy thoughts about: 1
from behind him: 1
wand rose into: 1
when they learn: 1
it was starting: 1
rationalists are sorted: 1
was what gave: 1
other students they'd: 1
such a thing: 1
returned to him: 1
have been better: 1
opposition of the: 1
his skin and: 1
person who has: 1
the earth the: 1
that when he: 1
nothing harry sat: 1
him so harry: 1
and the fear: 1
times as his: 1
who needed to: 1
casts into the: 1
his cheek briefly: 1
tremendously relieved and: 1
human being glowing: 1
harry had handmade: 1
ground screaming and: 1
know and so: 1
and substance a: 1
it a strange: 1
the promise everything: 1
him quizzically and: 1
of a good: 1
calm the dreamlike: 1
herd the students: 1
leaving none for: 1
been named dementor: 1
before there's a: 1
his part glanced: 1
and saw that: 1
up with little: 1
cursed fire it: 1
mild the gaze: 1
word kept echoing: 1
expectations now everyone: 1
and even if: 1
fright ah harry: 1
little tune and: 1
the tarnished slightly: 1
had handmade her: 1
ought to have: 1
fading sunset the: 1
fulfill the promise: 1
harry climbed to: 1
vulnerability in the: 1
out loud for: 1
them more than: 1
the right frame: 1
fully into its: 1
two arms two: 1
breaking dam surged: 1
was also obvious: 1
place and another: 1
now everyone was: 1
on some level: 1
i tried to: 1
up and leveled: 1
there were intakes: 1
charm or else: 1
there was nothing: 1
puzzled mr potter: 1
went to what: 1
cast his white: 1
some law of: 1
eyes went back: 1
into each other's: 1
stop himself while: 1
what did it: 1
is what you: 1
say that i: 1
it harry's gaze: 1
answer and just: 1
the aurors were: 1
earth the stars: 1
and all bright: 1
professor mcgonagall telling: 1
you're completely insane: 1
to forget he'd: 1
into ravenclaw leaving: 1
into his wand: 1
seems unlikely mr: 1
to respond -: 1
it was obvious: 1
could feel the: 1
is healed at: 1
and though harry: 1
on auror goryanof's: 1
riddle what lies: 1
a sharp gaze: 1
warmth poured out: 1
couldn't think of: 1
then launched himself: 1
a dry precise: 1
he said everyone: 1
an elaborate thing: 1
a strange word: 1
here now in: 1
and that it: 1
distant descendants of: 1
quirrell was staring: 1
himself all the: 1
there to fear: 1
troubles didn't mean: 1
back at the: 1
of himself to: 1
was a creature: 1
under supervision he: 1
same patronus or: 1
was only auror: 1
a certain amount: 1
someday we'll get: 1
darkness watching him: 1
toward the path: 1
dementor could not: 1
know you are: 1
been pulled away: 1
girl gazed into: 1
none for other: 1
to do this: 1
do it was: 1
to tell you: 1
harry's gaze went: 1
what you need: 1
pictures and the: 1
and ask a: 1
an answer is: 1
born into the: 1
but the headmaster: 1
again the absence: 1
right the peace: 1
questions starting harry: 1
an impossible memory: 1
all the pieces: 1
trio it would: 1
bobbed its head: 1
shape of a: 1
you say fear: 1
i don't mind: 1
and look for: 1
really being aware: 1
a dementor what: 1
anything threatened hogwarts: 1
make professor mcgonagall: 1
to have another: 1
little nuisances if: 1
wretched themselves they: 1
look about her: 1
is the courage: 1
from all around: 1
its meaning the: 1
stare at him: 1
let it out: 1
a pound of: 1
him like a: 1
that you were: 1
if it becomes: 1
tattered cloak almost: 1
it becomes necessary: 1
even without a: 1
face hard and: 1
to kill fear: 1
it was also: 1
world harry said: 1

fawkes was on: 1
its cage then: 1
to see an: 1
let's take it: 1
he wanted to: 1
away slowly he: 1
a little harry: 1
answer is the: 1
happy thought and: 1
on it but: 1
departed and so: 1
afraid but what: 1

just a side: 1
at dumbledore harry: 1
took in a: 1
face reality without: 1
a spell of: 1
a human shone: 1
he had let: 1

glanced significantly at: 1
and yet brighter: 1
it was what: 1
on a problem: 1
defiance that echoed: 1
distances i comprehend: 1
a sharp look: 1
thought to himself: 1
to know how: 1
after a sharp: 1
direction of the: 1
him as they: 1
keeps his own: 1
always know and: 1
were all looking: 1
play his trump: 1
fully recovered mr: 1
do end me: 1
stars significant made: 1
thomas and ron: 1
gaze went to: 1
the world is: 1
but somehow thoughts: 1
patronus charm or: 1
then professor mcgonagall: 1
auror komodo let's: 1
the winter-blasted grass: 1
up from a: 1
it was natural: 1
a similar mishap: 1
really know how: 1
their breath i: 1
quirinus there will: 1
harry would think: 1
a riddle what: 1
of defiance that: 1
her was studying: 1
ah harry said: 1
to bear it: 1
the dementor harry's: 1
who said that: 1
try there is: 1
fawkes perched warmth: 1
managing to stop: 1
watching him slowly: 1
bought him mum's: 1
spare electronics parts: 1
dementor the void: 1
plan for finding: 1
eyes after sleep: 1
won't tell the: 1
there was horror: 1
still alive again: 1
prey taken from: 1
his arm into: 1
student verged on: 1
temporary nuisances like: 1
you are fully: 1
as his fingers: 1
professor quirrell that: 1
drained your power: 1
over you the: 1
all right the: 1
mind refuses to: 1
the calm the: 1
what you did: 1
harry writhing on: 1
much vaster future: 1
destructive spell professor: 1
told her that: 1
falsely mr potter: 1
the phoenix's presence: 1
the cloak the: 1
alive if you: 1
he'd almost said: 1
that made life: 1
again yep harry: 1
at him the: 1
make that bright: 1
with wands and: 1
and science i: 1
the worst of: 1
what happens next: 1
the books his: 1
dementors the children's: 1
from harry and: 1
fit once you: 1
so much darkness: 1
the sun squeaked: 1
the children's children's: 1
could be wretched: 1
leaving this earned: 1
best chance at: 1
do - no: 1
harry meant to: 1
amount of opposition: 1
of course not: 1
becomes necessary quirinus: 1
itself that the: 1
without really being: 1
human species will: 1
embrace it is: 1
of winning i: 1
wondering and desiring: 1
seem likely that: 1
a riddle and: 1
earliest days of: 1
himself while fawkes: 1
more than i: 1
about leaving this: 1
for i will: 1
it on his: 1
her which suggested: 1
on his skin: 1
way to do: 1
of it on: 1
and the girl: 1
would be reluctant: 1
dementor at harry: 1
the thought exploded: 1
and stick to: 1
looked puzzled but: 1
day so far: 1
defense professor pointed: 1
though harry had: 1
could hear the: 1
wretched so that: 1
a childish thing: 1
go at the: 1
final time mantled: 1
in which professor: 1
sighs of relief: 1
had come fully: 1
cloak almost absentmindedly: 1
and an auror: 1
the headmaster finally: 1
needed to talk: 1
later while the: 1
likely that harry: 1
to apologize all: 1
a flash of: 1
beneath the cloak: 1
it exuded stole: 1
all the floodgates: 1
said still absentmindedly: 1
turned out that: 1
open drain through: 1
and roused himself: 1
an adequate shield: 1
name here a: 1
books his father: 1
wand that professor: 1
the distant descendants: 1
keeping up with: 1
of opposition of: 1
plagued by dementors: 1
the feeling of: 1
its prey taken: 1
of away harry: 1
thomas cast his: 1
he needed to: 1
and people won't: 1
descendants of humankind: 1
he may at: 1
exhaled like waking: 1
couldn't hurt you: 1
it so there: 1
strange word kept: 1
chance of winning: 1
be a refuge: 1
that echoed around: 1
seen the worst: 1
after sleep harry's: 1
it larger hm: 1
his mind harry: 1
ah said a: 1
harry said fawkes: 1
to harry she: 1
either i think: 1
to her and: 1
someday that too: 1
obvious enough riddle: 1
law of magic: 1
the cage he: 1
take it back: 1
loud for obvious: 1
think of a: 1
ingredient he'd never: 1
blue and white: 1
another will take: 1
him the auror: 1
on the winter-blasted: 1
upon all the: 1
position for the: 1
kind of person: 1
you are not: 1
that would help: 1
that bright shape: 1
recovered mr potter: 1
- no hermione: 1
quirrell was right: 1
stared directly at: 1
head standing upright: 1
how to say: 1
time mantled his: 1
to say thank: 1
appeared tremendously relieved: 1
to the tall: 1
is a common: 1
wanted the fear: 1
students they'd seen: 1
power and strength: 1
beginning of all: 1
to her afterward: 1
you're wondering whether: 1
dean thomas and: 1
sometimes what you: 1
part of what: 1
think i'm okay: 1
to deny any: 1
are not invincible: 1
that professor quirrell: 1
patronus only this: 1
for him so: 1
from your own: 1
we do not: 1
all the best: 1
hat it has: 1
just let me: 1
within his mind: 1
hermione's friendship and: 1
right thing to: 1
destroy a dementor: 1
spell of cursed: 1
told me to: 1
the chance of: 1
can do -: 1
okay this did: 1
silence again the: 1
arm into his: 1
the spell hadn't: 1
of the trio: 1
aside the calm: 1
three days to: 1
did you know: 1
come fully into: 1
species will end: 1
to me said: 1
be destroyed throw: 1
no fright ah: 1
not yet outgrown: 1
of sparkling mist: 1
tell the children: 1
parts from the: 1
cage then back: 1
the last remnants: 1
slid exactly the: 1
they'd never amount: 1
kept echoing in: 1
sorry to tell: 1
dumbledore said harry: 1
virtue a rationalist: 1
the first answer: 1
held their breath: 1
power that the: 1
actually talk or: 1
another sneak off: 1
harry turned back: 1
of humankind as: 1
dean and everyone: 1
the blue sky: 1
piercing cry and: 1
for other houses: 1
an argument in: 1
from where fawkes: 1
to get rid: 1
seen him on: 1
i think professor: 1
paling into nothingness: 1
said i'd like: 1
after fawkes left: 1
right distances i: 1
professor flitwick looked: 1
tried to hide: 1
i don't really: 1
to put himself: 1
on dumbledore's face: 1
happened to him: 1
the pieces and: 1
that he needed: 1
think so professor: 1
launched himself from: 1
of mind and: 1
final warm and: 1
you need a: 1
said quietly well: 1
of death not: 1
i thought you: 1
but then leave: 1
floodgates inside him: 1
something i have: 1
though only a: 1
handmade her a: 1
thought as his: 1
headmaster calculated that: 1
has to use: 1
cage they are: 1
firmly as though: 1
moment after fawkes: 1
while the phoenix: 1
riddle once you: 1
the patronuses were: 1
annoyed harry though: 1
him they were: 1
thought remembered all: 1
someday wherever i: 1
he was ready: 1
back excuse me: 1
she turned from: 1
say said harry: 1
that the human: 1
all things before: 1
they had come: 1
could not reach: 1
fear but harry: 1
still so much: 1
regained an impossible: 1
meanwhile there were: 1
it be destroyed: 1
common misconception thought: 1
the descendants of: 1
the dementors were: 1
much effect on: 1
flitwick began to: 1
its head in: 1
the tiniest smidgin: 1
to walk toward: 1
him to make: 1
to look upon: 1
yes said dumbledore: 1
a dementor so: 1
after all i: 1
the right sort: 1
better to get: 1
there came sharp: 1
elements of himself: 1
but no one: 1
might say that: 1
cage guarded by: 1
himself to awaken: 1
put up with: 1
problem ' they: 1
and fulfill the: 1
sky and brilliant: 1
the phoenix's remaining: 1
which annoyed harry: 1
shadow that death: 1
how did you: 1
humanity was and: 1
image because it: 1
of spare electronics: 1
own patronus up: 1
hear it dumbledore: 1
death is not: 1
dementors mum and: 1
argument harry glanced: 1
went you could: 1
hard and spat: 1
the one who: 1
could flee and: 1
understood fear people: 1
a simple enough: 1
a problem and: 1
tattered cloak looked: 1
phoenix still shone: 1
have tried really: 1
to flash lights: 1
why the spell: 1
be killed many: 1
happen right now: 1
in the presence: 1
that his parents: 1
throw it into: 1
the dementor approached: 1
mind for the: 1
minerva mcgonagall's voice: 1
stay and watch: 1
we'll get over: 1
romance in their: 1
the direction of: 1
produced on dumbledore's: 1
to hear that: 1
impossible to kill: 1
you were i: 1
in space amid: 1
for you at: 1
dementor on his: 1
professor quirrell headmaster: 1
dementor would have: 1
where fawkes perched: 1
stick to it: 1
fawkes cawed at: 1
had taken him: 1
'what if the: 1
telling him that: 1
said that she: 1
there's anything i: 1
that all right: 1
dementor's presence and: 1
as they went: 1
to listen there: 1
the brilliant points: 1
like to try: 1
to face it: 1
it seems unlikely: 1
talk to her: 1
happens next if: 1
sun is very: 1
wound in the: 1
completely insane variety: 1
to say goodbye: 1
a while sometimes: 1
some point or: 1
dumbledore beside her: 1
than i know: 1
acceded since it: 1
listen there was: 1
from him like: 1
in the direction: 1
unlucky few to: 1
despite the understandable: 1
look toward the: 1
a little tune: 1
upon harry didn't: 1
else and that: 1
was clear enough: 1
his white bear: 1
away from something: 1
you could hear: 1
face it harry's: 1
other possibility now: 1
really harry said: 1
raised his head: 1
the dementor screaming: 1
that your strongest: 1
at this it: 1
concluded that the: 1
something important and: 1
ready now to: 1
other students stay: 1
like opening his: 1
at the tarnished: 1
from harry launched: 1
until they're old: 1
suppose the ravenclaw: 1
main problem ': 1
the courage to: 1
his head of: 1
into the starting: 1
reasons and they: 1
said it shouldn't: 1
through four patronuses: 1
than any decaying: 1
quirrell everyone's faces: 1
the fear came: 1
no there was: 1
is very large: 1
to that there: 1
concluded the day: 1
memory of the: 1
pain and troubles: 1
it would become: 1
extremely dangerous and: 1
said seamus in: 1
what gave everything: 1
harry discarded the: 1
so far as: 1
dementor the tattered: 1
reflex to look: 1
seamus in a: 1
are not undying: 1
a promise that: 1
then followed her: 1
field and before: 1
guessing the one: 1
not undying said: 1
do i accuse: 1
you would use: 1
opening all the: 1
only a childish: 1
face was rigid: 1
end me before: 1
named dementor the: 1
weasley put up: 1
too was part: 1
ground and know: 1
was horror on: 1
talk later dean: 1
he'd never truly: 1
own degree of: 1
people understood fear: 1
said that was: 1
what made the: 1
to exist ah: 1
to him put: 1
the emptiness the: 1
sleep harry's gaze: 1
all that the: 1
have much effect: 1
virtue is curiosity: 1
the words mild: 1
else harry drew: 1
thought you might: 1
were still willing: 1
calmly he'd almost: 1
battle called upon: 1
all right though: 1
to harry said: 1
would be remembered: 1
students who needed: 1
knew to avoid: 1
if the headmaster: 1
harry that all: 1
quirrell shielding their: 1
flitwick had returned: 1
him are you: 1
it say said: 1
you might say: 1
say it out: 1
even if you: 1
down someday wherever: 1
saw that everyone: 1
pure fear that: 1
stole away all: 1
say goodbye any: 1
tarnished slightly corroded: 1
wear the edges: 1
borrowed from your: 1
point or another: 1
said which i: 1
put his feet: 1
the shadow of: 1
did it say: 1
could ever draw: 1
had the headmaster: 1
the three aurors: 1
saw what lay: 1
off into nothing: 1
corroded cage he: 1
thrice and four: 1
been worn into: 1
is just a: 1
your power and: 1
ravenclaw indicates that: 1
the ravenclaw door: 1
a number of: 1
that when they: 1
harry though only: 1
he would collapse: 1
when there was: 1
nervously at each: 1
he saw what: 1
they began to: 1
a certain look: 1
the image that: 1
image that had: 1
and all the: 1
earth until they're: 1
he had regained: 1
calculated that when: 1
squeaked professor flitwick: 1
else who looked: 1
harry knew and: 1
he looked around: 1
true rivals and: 1
know and would: 1
the final warm: 1
of the night: 1
rivals and friends: 1
and strength its: 1
problem so they'd: 1
it meant to: 1
was an obvious: 1
any other student: 1
i end you: 1
it would have: 1
they'd just seen: 1
into nothingness in: 1
could react to: 1
wand and the: 1
it and people: 1
to teach himself: 1
looked around and: 1
that she honestly: 1
harry drew forth: 1
than the main: 1
mum and dad: 1
sun so radiant: 1
up to him: 1
night sky would: 1
and all of: 1
trio first but: 1
mcgonagall came and: 1
spell hadn't worked: 1
right harry thought: 1
finally staring at: 1
headmaster dumbledore and: 1
tattered cloak that: 1
would you say: 1
that led back: 1
be plagued by: 1
harry said seamus: 1
humanity have spread: 1
still be plagued: 1
his strength into: 1
albus dumbledore was: 1
hurt through four: 1
me harry said: 1
to the gates: 1
now i believe: 1
it out loud: 1
just like that: 1
even running faster: 1
head in the: 1
was up next: 1
the dreamlike state: 1
have is borrowed: 1
nuisances if you: 1
house departed and: 1
the warmth of: 1
have fought to: 1
and that was: 1
sometimes you need: 1
poured all his: 1
missing ingredient he'd: 1
only virtue a: 1
they'd seen him: 1
light it belonged: 1
one at all: 1
fear came over: 1
and harry sent: 1
amount to anything: 1
to make professor: 1
you threw it: 1
became corporeal took: 1
his feet into: 1
creature of pure: 1
legs and a: 1
else was wrong: 1
and wretched themselves: 1
they learn they'll: 1
harry launched himself: 1
threatened hogwarts everything: 1
the dementor seeming: 1
and leveled straight: 1
and so remained: 1
his mind and: 1
here a spell: 1
they are not: 1
realizing that hermione: 1
humankind as they: 1
harry couldn't think: 1
knew me and: 1
desecrate it a: 1
somehow thoughts like: 1
him on the: 1
song gently trailed: 1
in their hearts: 1
relief or something: 1
the light neville: 1
out loud fawkes: 1
would not see: 1
will not name: 1
need to happen: 1
before anyone could: 1
still in its: 1
and another until: 1
said auror komodo: 1
fingers moved into: 1
slowly he exhaled: 1
feel guilty about: 1
expecto patronum the: 1
as everyone else: 1
they'd concluded that: 1
headmaster keeps his: 1
dementor approached and: 1
protect if anything: 1
looked up to: 1
to have been: 1
a while but: 1
perched warmth spreading: 1
the promise of: 1
what he was: 1
the gates of: 1
the understandable emotions: 1
presence there were: 1
there within that: 1
directly at that: 1
mind if the: 1
and friends coaxing: 1
about it though: 1
its power that: 1
- it is: 1
earth as it: 1
began to herd: 1
were animals the: 1
own mind and: 1
and space the: 1
remnants of the: 1
only little nuisances: 1
that if we: 1
observed this to: 1
have a chance: 1
auror trio was: 1
cheek briefly and: 1
in the earliest: 1
hide his face: 1
i believe miss: 1
almost held off: 1
emptiness the hole: 1
the structure they: 1
death touch me: 1
at him looking: 1
i have to: 1
ask a question: 1
aware of what: 1
to stare at: 1
fear is just: 1
as they left: 1
on earth on: 1
warmth faded a: 1
his mind the: 1
when it was: 1
harry's head and: 1
spat toward the: 1
they have is: 1
the presence of: 1
you if i: 1
him something i: 1
with reflected sunlight: 1
thoughts its closeness: 1
you have to: 1
stars the image: 1
quirrell it's not: 1
were just plain: 1
only harry professor: 1
like a good: 1
dementor couldn't hurt: 1
you did here: 1
and draco's journey: 1
very close to: 1
enough mistake the: 1
guilty about leaving: 1
other houses this: 1
degree of vulnerability: 1
fawkes nuzzled his: 1
any decaying mummy: 1
destroyed throw it: 1
think the structure: 1
symbolize death through: 1
hadn't worked for: 1
potter said minerva: 1
thought exploded from: 1
all the students: 1
followed her as: 1
be hurt could: 1
their eyes in: 1
the mind refuses: 1
wands and meanwhile: 1
dementor harry's request: 1
reluctant to look: 1
harry could be: 1
it is what: 1
it as a: 1
such as the: 1
part glanced significantly: 1
cannot be killed: 1
they do not: 1
to protect if: 1
before intelligent life: 1
fought and temporary: 1
right sort of: 1
may at some: 1
started a bit: 1
sent out all: 1
wand burst from: 1
the fear is: 1
journey neville and: 1
he exhaled like: 1
the beginning of: 1
that which lay: 1
the void the: 1
human faded away: 1
discover their own: 1
hurt you if: 1
to wear the: 1
raised up within: 1
and when they: 1
spread from star: 1

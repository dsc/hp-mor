into them unable: 1
headmaster and hermione: 1
she'd started wondering: 1

you would have: 1
mirthlessly one perceives: 1

placed in grownup: 1
also wasn't sure: 1

oaken door in: 1
harry and not: 1

armor - professor: 1
- that the: 1
miss granger dumbledore: 1
seemed like one: 1
could ask for: 1

and with an: 1
as his finger: 1
art only through: 1
side hermione put: 1
i didn't -: 1
flitwick would say: 1

mcgonagall everything because: 1
you pinned all: 1
that time there: 1
rules the defense: 1
to someone like: 1
back up to: 1
really but there: 1
that doesn't seem: 1
help professor mcgonagall: 1
drawers was the: 1
she'd been indignant: 1
head i have: 1
faded badger and: 1
require them to: 1
headmaster is wrong: 1
along with helplessness: 1
in every direction: 1
she realized where: 1
might be making: 1
you here something: 1
excellent memory for: 1
far beyond the: 1
voice now a: 1
been saving up: 1
professor she'd been: 1
that is unfortunate: 1
sadder as she: 1
her leave me: 1
decided to be: 1
gargoyles stepped out: 1
look quite as: 1
known she wouldn't: 1
behind the stone: 1
as ever and: 1
away she climbed: 1
be me the: 1
them stepped out: 1
was wearing except: 1
know it will: 1
i'd been saving: 1
a massed finite: 1
to a symbol: 1
doing the wrong: 1
was very clear: 1
time harry didn't: 1
that the wise: 1
and eager and: 1
would say the: 1
annoyed with her: 1
they are there: 1
alternatives and so: 1
him little enough: 1
up her hand: 1
before she was: 1
when the flowing: 1
the first such: 1
to lose to: 1
her as just: 1
raven and in: 1
that maybe she: 1
whether the sorting: 1
helix that shouldn't: 1
is not what: 1
repeat those words: 1
like that not: 1
his voice now: 1
an important reason: 1
dumbledore those blue: 1
a little slower: 1
i - said: 1
hogwarts the lion: 1
fewer remember elizabeth: 1
wrong thing fear: 1
her a moment: 1
past him and: 1
other things in: 1
have dispelled mr: 1
might be the: 1
of fighting that: 1
wrong about that: 1
except his underwear: 1
changed since the: 1
would have dispelled: 1
out he was: 1
at harry and: 1
as your professor: 1
a hot ball: 1
generals and saw: 1
voice you said: 1
a tall order: 1
expecting to win: 1
how fortunate are: 1
when i had: 1
saw that harry: 1
if i want: 1
dumbledore's voice had: 1
hogwarts was much: 1
out behind his: 1
gazed at them: 1
inside her and: 1
little slower his: 1
someone i cannot: 1
a fair fight: 1
ignorance and lack: 1
my classes except: 1
feeling very nice: 1
give up free: 1
hermione thought it: 1
again along with: 1
harry didn't follow: 1
professor's face had: 1
revolve around him: 1
heraldry of hogwarts: 1
and dangerous general: 1
bones waiting to: 1
said hermione i'm: 1
and her legs: 1
you that meant: 1
first corner away: 1
what hermione burst: 1
about harry's dark: 1
fear of saying: 1
to see her: 1
that many things: 1
for something like: 1
have felt that: 1
battle the world: 1
to remember how: 1
back in my: 1
finger on the: 1
break i'd like: 1
otherwise this mr: 1
you were fighting: 1
told professor mcgonagall: 1
his eyes gazed: 1
it is indeed: 1
at all how: 1
the burning sensation: 1
idea at all: 1
should've been nervous: 1
grow up when: 1
still want to: 1
headmaster wasn't going: 1
you see a: 1
those blue eyes: 1
throat and said: 1
harry's face tightened: 1
do with noble: 1
be counted she: 1
stair which had: 1
cannot imagine how: 1
wished to isolate: 1
reddened and cheeks: 1
do what is: 1
left toward a: 1
nearly everyone in: 1
behind his desk: 1
harry's eleven harry: 1
pattering across the: 1
of hogwarts have: 1
not even dream: 1
who we are: 1
you then it: 1
to have to: 1
but dumbledore didn't: 1
enchantment had been: 1
thought it seemed: 1
miss granger had: 1
and yet worthy: 1
heroes the hot: 1
to both other: 1
indeed that is: 1
or uncomfortable about: 1
fear that cuts: 1
to you i: 1
what's right -: 1
too said hermione: 1
he lost he: 1
because no matter: 1
blue eyes were: 1
potter onto the: 1
meant everyone was: 1
a standstill so: 1
air sometimes like: 1
failed strategy over: 1
doing whatever he: 1
a little hotter: 1
mcgonagall had told: 1
one i -: 1
moment you wished: 1
might think she: 1
their whole lives: 1
could pass through: 1
he said that: 1
in the previous: 1
everything else he: 1
please tell the: 1
days when no: 1
ever got close: 1
if you choose: 1
he could just: 1
subtle than is: 1
if this was: 1
said hermione if: 1
her anywhere at: 1
unexpected that is: 1
professor mcgonagall looked: 1
it's right hermione: 1
yet i shouldn't: 1
wanted to make: 1
share this information: 1
child hermione glanced: 1
gaze as penetrating: 1
couldn't even look: 1
have to do: 1
wizardry and it: 1
as though sitting: 1
all and instead: 1
are harry's friend: 1
their general flying: 1
about how people: 1
together tightly and: 1
it is time: 1
eyes gazed at: 1
again rather wryly: 1
what they were: 1
matter what contest: 1
as just something: 1
wall so ubiquitous: 1
sunshine soldiers the: 1
but the look: 1
being scared just: 1
around her a: 1
- doesn't seem: 1
she used up: 1
and i would: 1
from professor quirrell's: 1
cannot quite comprehend: 1
shoulder when she: 1
voice and then: 1
to her a: 1
battle you and: 1
do not need: 1
forward a bit: 1
said dryly mr: 1
gently twinkling eyes: 1
it came out: 1
this entire time: 1
truly has forgotten: 1
decisions and yet: 1
although of course: 1
understand why professor: 1
that you are: 1
them sharp and: 1
the headmaster only: 1
pattering of footsteps: 1
chaotic legionnaires with: 1
soon as they: 1
hadn't been able: 1
hex and so: 1
thousand alternatives that: 1
trying to be: 1
that could not: 1
realization that you: 1
harry potter had: 1
permitted a formal: 1
headmaster cleared his: 1
for help with: 1
transfiguration professor's face: 1
opportunities explodes with: 1
walked forward a: 1
would give her: 1
and rested his: 1
they might become: 1
whisper from behind: 1
because they are: 1
as she realized: 1
her here if: 1
the wands from: 1
always are in: 1
to do better: 1
eight soldiers from: 1
draco malfoy only: 1
- i still: 1
because of time: 1
fair being a: 1
get too near: 1
mcgonagall now what: 1
face with its: 1
they turned the: 1
that the moment: 1
than before no: 1
over what your: 1
the sacrilege if: 1
and say that: 1
in my capacity: 1
doing what is: 1
dumbledore rose from: 1
the challenge if: 1
i would term: 1
he is destined: 1
that cuts off: 1
to so i: 1
reached her eyes: 1
you could beat: 1
you had thought: 1
enough for that: 1
dangerous general malfoy: 1
mcgonagall's hand which: 1
had cried herself: 1
only that couldn't: 1
to try a: 1
and sometimes they: 1
shocked if someone: 1
governed by the: 1
a bit -: 1
whisper i'm so: 1
anymore and professor: 1
mcgonagall her voice: 1
had told her: 1
performance i expected: 1
that boy just: 1
against the two: 1
tell you why: 1
his own vulnerability: 1
if you are: 1
mr potter shot: 1
and fewer remember: 1
not about glory: 1
at the door: 1
looked resigned general: 1
hex while your: 1
with calm precision: 1
be done to: 1
due monday and: 1
shot her in: 1
dignity and feeling: 1
most ancient houses: 1
it's not your: 1
the headmaster she: 1
and farther away: 1
in a quiet: 1
know thyself and: 1
while draco malfoy: 1
had the misfortune: 1
to be sharpened: 1
up enough quirrell: 1
been frightened should've: 1
dumbledore frowned as: 1
name although of: 1
told after she: 1
was fawkes on: 1
headmaster would say: 1
hermione granger had: 1
is what is: 1
hermione said slowly: 1
world now knows: 1
into whose gently: 1
how fifty death: 1
of hogwarts the: 1
once before i: 1
your full potential: 1
potter's suit of: 1
crying yet and: 1
not respect such: 1
right you know: 1
her cheeks but: 1
not saying it's: 1
wince for the: 1
tell you in: 1
find words she'd: 1
say something then: 1
of footsteps behind: 1
granger what seems: 1
subject to negotiation: 1
the chilly stone: 1
shocked as her: 1
at once -: 1
face tightened up: 1
she felt a: 1
losing something and: 1
is terribly important: 1
wizard more than: 1
said inside her: 1
ween that in: 1
he wouldn't even: 1
else that doesn't: 1
every battle a: 1
time and hermione: 1
your army's hopes: 1
mcgonagall finally spoke: 1
and smiled only: 1
from your army: 1
rested reassuringly on: 1
going to cry: 1
try to scare: 1
granger and mr: 1
you think you: 1
own person so: 1
hero's burden which: 1
went left toward: 1
information with anyone: 1
will i always: 1
the feelings are: 1
be the original: 1
two hundred points: 1
us needing to: 1

leader and i: 1
are afraid miss: 1
his eyes blinked: 1
a faded shield: 1
disrupted her thoughts: 1
words if you: 1
start of this: 1
ball with her: 1
faint from magical: 1
general potter you: 1
is time to: 1
able to explain: 1
revolving around her: 1
up it was: 1

there is anything: 1
if she might: 1
offered you that: 1
say a word: 1

to the headmaster: 1
but i was: 1
many things in: 1
like a hard: 1
taken her a: 1
a wavering voice: 1
fawkes on his: 1
the raven would: 1
professor mcgonagall's face: 1
involved a ravenclaw: 1
ran her feet: 1
the back with: 1
nervousness as she: 1
from up close: 1
blue eyes seemed: 1
wall with her: 1
smiled again rather: 1
soldiers the defense: 1
that you be: 1
and yet you: 1
her voice didn't: 1
said to me: 1
i would guess: 1

she didn't understand: 1
other generals and: 1
if you had: 1
out of their: 1
of the thousand: 1
see miss granger: 1
eyes and when: 1
and so after: 1
went right instead: 1
now if she: 1
those like you: 1
said harry i: 1
never learned they: 1
you to learn: 1
and from then: 1
she didn't know: 1

too much well: 1
again walked right: 1

that could have: 1
didn't break i'd: 1
had already tired: 1
touched fingers of: 1
for the sacrilege: 1
neville and then: 1
read history books: 1
such a man: 1
- harry's voice: 1
the chaos legion: 1
little older than: 1
gryffindor say i: 1
a feeling that: 1
salazar slytherin dumbledore: 1
lined you see: 1
- miss granger: 1
now she'd rather: 1
points but she: 1
she dared with: 1
is remembered harry: 1
stronger than both: 1
and a leader: 1
but she decided: 1
pathway then you: 1
hermione glanced back: 1
was a pattering: 1
wondered what her: 1
from over touched: 1
suddenly looked very: 1
and ran her: 1
ministry continues in: 1
is destined for: 1
i said i: 1
since miss greengrass: 1
pointed to a: 1
darkness though it: 1
she was surprised: 1
hermione she looked: 1
away when you: 1
slowly creaked open: 1
be by following: 1
is there anything: 1
head of gryffindor: 1
that you can: 1
that you cannot: 1
to stop being: 1
her shoulder this: 1
be divided among: 1
sometimes they didn't: 1
really said draco: 1
someone else so: 1
it is i: 1
malfoy went left: 1
silver-bearded headmaster of: 1
right choice for: 1
her mind that: 1
with something clever: 1
and went around: 1
only figured out: 1
them unable to: 1
something to do: 1
he needs his: 1
run any further: 1
a sad little: 1
potter i tell: 1
and choosing to: 1
sunshine regiment -: 1
professor quirrell's eyes: 1
last time she'd: 1
be time enough: 1
for any reason: 1
the other generals: 1
shoulder he grew: 1
with her vision: 1
was ever worried: 1
believed you when: 1
realized where that: 1
have you chosen: 1
not think the: 1
endless stair she: 1
leaves me no: 1
you are asking: 1
to make the: 1
rare realization that: 1
can accept them: 1
potter's mysterious old: 1
said it came: 1
year and went: 1
hero myself once: 1
chilled hermione's blood: 1
you be stripped: 1
to look right: 1
books miss granger: 1
was done there: 1
so that you: 1
not her i: 1
else and so: 1
of it in: 1
he would still: 1
should come to: 1
hero that was: 1
at all only: 1
and didn't you: 1
not fair hermione: 1
of you together: 1
have taken her: 1
hermione we almost: 1
entered her office: 1
because i know: 1
three seconds before: 1
entitled to demand: 1
if she looked: 1
should've tried against: 1
professor mcgonagall now: 1
woke up it: 1
put in all: 1
is i who: 1
and kept on: 1
feelings that's not: 1
stairs and then: 1
to win that: 1
over he has: 1
was in the: 1
sorry it's not: 1
draco malfoy said: 1
eyes hermione said: 1
riding he didn't: 1
dumbledore's voice from: 1
and i ween: 1
surrounding harry potter: 1
the same thing: 1
like you're helping: 1
them you are: 1
firing on daphne: 1
clear what answer: 1
head turned toward: 1
apparently it is: 1
armies as soon: 1
but apparently it: 1
he would never: 1
know it's suspicious: 1
her in the: 1
just marked down: 1
said the young: 1
if it was: 1
thoughts and it: 1
an error that: 1
hermione put up: 1
resolution her voice: 1
tell you true: 1
her throat and: 1
harry she still: 1
that had been: 1
it is like: 1
year as a: 1
of saying or: 1
hogwarts upon his: 1
name of hermione: 1
me for a: 1
are there or: 1
sort of mistake: 1
expression was as: 1
why i've asked: 1
both of them: 1
dumbledore into whose: 1
just kept on: 1
word really said: 1
side and crush: 1
their united force: 1
of their way: 1
what i'll do: 1
mcgonagall looked like: 1
mcgonagall and hermione: 1
a lot harder: 1
miss granger people: 1
she had a: 1
to make us: 1
would have just: 1
keep up with: 1
explain - hermione: 1
for and she: 1
just totally absolutely: 1
corridor forked and: 1
granger hermione nodded: 1
fighting that had: 1
space filled with: 1
asking for help: 1
never ever going: 1
up with something: 1
else in hogwarts: 1
he didn't he: 1
professor mcgonagall about: 1
didn't look quite: 1
and seeing what: 1
by following our: 1
will be time: 1
live in miss: 1
live their whole: 1
because it was: 1
had to shut: 1
classes except broomstick: 1
three of you: 1
am sorry hermione: 1
through her the: 1
massed finite incantatem: 1
went but right: 1
his dark side: 1
inside her mind: 1
sleep hex while: 1
office hours but: 1
feelings are there: 1
own response was: 1
course there are: 1
to suspect that: 1
he had his: 1
me like you're: 1
be stripped of: 1
one notes that: 1
right now she'd: 1
to say aloud: 1
granger walked away: 1
only never learned: 1
incantatem on general: 1
like that if: 1
habit of thought: 1
had grown sadder: 1
would be a: 1
go into his: 1
for a bit: 1
beating you then: 1
potter you will: 1
of them such: 1
hermione wince for: 1
her mouth and: 1
not if they: 1
to achieve their: 1
she didn't answer: 1
wizard shook his: 1
been thinking a: 1
hundred points a: 1
the flash of: 1
happening to harry: 1
if he didn't: 1
mr malfoy's own: 1
since the start: 1
guess that of: 1
it because she: 1
for that later: 1
i could pass: 1
is necessary to: 1
the point where: 1
beat you when: 1
awful to say: 1
tried against harry: 1
that passage went: 1
spells she should've: 1
there was an: 1
to do with: 1
so i used: 1
one else that: 1
into the corridors: 1
burst out again: 1
accept them or: 1
she glanced over: 1
head rapidly but: 1
much-loved ministry continues: 1
if i walk: 1
a friend is: 1
very very hard: 1
three armies to: 1
other drawers was: 1
and i am: 1
might accomplish everything: 1
her and put: 1
would a gryffindor: 1
in professor quirrell's: 1
because it would: 1
are placed in: 1
i who defeated: 1
and so you: 1
don't become who: 1
looking like it: 1
its rule the: 1
needing to beat: 1
when you told: 1
with her at: 1
the headmaster sighed: 1
trying to unravel: 1
know that but: 1
the headmaster and: 1
the headmaster cleared: 1
but that is: 1
it was the: 1
burning inside her: 1
among dragon army: 1
to be miss: 1
can do to: 1
turning the great: 1
to the challenge: 1
turning her around: 1
professor mcgonagall everything: 1
know miss granger: 1
most people are: 1
since the day: 1
even close and: 1
didn't violate some: 1
which had been: 1
flight of stairs: 1
been thinking she'd: 1
that - that: 1
game but -: 1
anger burning inside: 1
i cannot quite: 1
futile sleep hexes: 1
i am sorry: 1
her newfound resolution: 1
trained into them: 1
give it what: 1
hero the old: 1
granger the world: 1
else she couldn't: 1
only twelve that: 1
twelve harry's eleven: 1
it's not about: 1
nor professor mcgonagall: 1
suspicious mr potter: 1
my classes this: 1
not be counted: 1
sounding puzzled i: 1
fight anymore draco: 1
you outright that: 1
exhaustion professor quirrell: 1
a breath and: 1
to gentle his: 1
glanced over at: 1
of chainmail and: 1
were meant to: 1
headmaster what you: 1
for you in: 1
out by two: 1
said from up: 1
deny it would: 1
harry potter turn: 1
a gryffindor say: 1
noticed that they: 1
like one of: 1
harder that time: 1
term well-reasoned but: 1
needs friends then: 1
battle magic at: 1
reason i had: 1
and he would: 1
the thought came: 1
eyes chilled hermione's: 1
his voice got: 1
so the sunshine: 1
i thought once: 1
okay if i: 1
exercise your full: 1
told - you: 1
and above all: 1
unjust world we: 1
not being scared: 1
wasn't going to: 1
so you did: 1
she couldn't have: 1
the roof the: 1
hardest every time: 1
filled with the: 1
that better than: 1
that nearly all: 1
could just go: 1
right the old: 1
become who we: 1
quirrell's office the: 1
general potter is: 1
was just -: 1
the question is: 1
and his gaze: 1
to a standstill: 1
stumbled a little: 1
potter that the: 1
scared just doing: 1
you i really: 1
hard not to: 1
eyes reddened and: 1
black hermione said: 1
it a faded: 1
turn to ill: 1
it was while: 1
would term well-reasoned: 1
old wizard not: 1
hermione or a: 1
and how our: 1
thousand times happier: 1
draco malfoy that: 1
try a massed: 1
- and choosing: 1
fact frightened and: 1
malfoy said in: 1
slytherins did they: 1
able to find: 1
know to be: 1
used a whole: 1
she couldn't even: 1
there are ways: 1
eyes she would: 1
they lead perhaps: 1
hermione had cried: 1
habits of fighting: 1
are in every: 1
be afraid to: 1
indignant at the: 1
to you at: 1
they believed you: 1
but then one: 1
i'll i'll -: 1
with a larger: 1
why she thought: 1
when she was: 1
will think of: 1
to face the: 1
he had the: 1
away from professor: 1
had washed her: 1
squeezed hermione's shoulder: 1
not yet i: 1
was she couldn't: 1
frowned as his: 1
you are in: 1
people not only: 1
the man said: 1
true never will: 1
able to run: 1
house it didn't: 1
divided among dragon: 1
touched behind a: 1
then afterward had: 1
been a good: 1
she swallowed i'll: 1
no one can: 1
distracted by all: 1
anything i should: 1
but congratulations nonetheless: 1
voice sounding a: 1
harry said hermione: 1
death eaters dominated: 1
the stone as: 1
on almost defeating: 1
on an equal: 1
harry hermione began: 1
capacity as your: 1
little bug that: 1
points a fifth-year: 1
hermione shook her: 1
strong on her: 1
sharply on his: 1
are in your: 1
couldn't find words: 1
didn't you say: 1
professor mcgonagall the: 1
wondering if she: 1
everyone thinks the: 1
grow up there: 1
the headmaster is: 1
harry - you: 1
- maybe the: 1
worried or uncomfortable: 1
close the defense: 1
they repeat the: 1
real the corridor: 1
very short time: 1
of their general: 1
face looked like: 1
that was like: 1
the world are: 1
finally spoke and: 1
on top of: 1
friend alas but: 1
i was mistaken: 1
voice sounded like: 1
doing whatever and: 1
got no one: 1
the transfiguration professor's: 1
little hotter that: 1
miss granger by: 1
they might accomplish: 1
her that they: 1
like to be: 1
expected of you: 1
her around to: 1
saving up -: 1
appear annoyed with: 1
dark side hermione: 1
it in your: 1
just been squished: 1
that couldn't be: 1
rap-rap i would: 1
that way over: 1
she couldn't find: 1
if someone had: 1
than is usual: 1
face the oaken: 1
- she'd known: 1
terrible thing miss: 1
of hogwarts upon: 1
and she went: 1
demand that you: 1
you say something: 1
her lungs on: 1
sad one i: 1
about harry hermione: 1
by myself i'm: 1
as they turned: 1
times beneath the: 1
they must grow: 1
probably wasn't even: 1
time i know: 1
all blurry ran: 1
you were able: 1
dispelled mr potter's: 1
of it that: 1
or a sad: 1
hands mr malfoy's: 1
answer even though: 1
come out of: 1
saw that the: 1
she hadn't been: 1
would not even: 1
then another wondering: 1
she looked up: 1
hero too said: 1
chin on steepled: 1
i i let: 1
such fear is: 1
frightened should've been: 1
grinned mirthlessly one: 1
course miss granger: 1
throat again along: 1
and in latin: 1
had said inside: 1
be sharpened into: 1
know i said: 1
healthy as he: 1
cast the stunning: 1
were just no: 1
by myself right: 1
world around us: 1
much of their: 1
wasn't looking at: 1
why but that: 1
his mysterious old: 1
just doing whatever: 1
right said the: 1
corridors of hogwarts: 1
to harry back: 1
just harry she: 1
professor mcgonagall's door: 1
may know that: 1
wars do not: 1
whole world revolves: 1
healing but miss: 1
of things that: 1
stop you miss: 1
or good either: 1
from everyone else: 1
here if the: 1
from if you: 1
plugged an electrical: 1
and if you: 1
older students now: 1
it would all: 1
face suddenly looked: 1
army's hopes on: 1
miss granger i'm: 1
house name although: 1
have been more: 1
hogwarts who would: 1
i did not: 1
i'm so terribly: 1
quite the man: 1
hermione's eyes had: 1
never try anything: 1
a sad air: 1
the right choice: 1
seconds before she: 1
witch's voice was: 1
that no one: 1
spoke and she: 1
he moved a: 1
it's what i'll: 1
even if she: 1
his throat and: 1
whole army that: 1
prove worthy of: 1
side i'm just: 1
bellatrix black no: 1
a most terrible: 1
faded snake why: 1
potter and hermione: 1
almost had them: 1
i've got to: 1
gently turning her: 1
was pulling farther: 1
that people don't: 1
her throat again: 1
voice from behind: 1
old wizard the: 1
professor said the: 1
floor and she: 1
to recognize that: 1
to pretend otherwise: 1
in every battle: 1
talking about and: 1
told them before: 1
anything that can: 1
the level of: 1
you can try: 1
something and she: 1
my dark side: 1
but it was: 1
someone like harry: 1
then i only: 1
professor quirrell's office: 1
a professor she'd: 1
pursue mr potter: 1
ancient houses said: 1
the folly of: 1
level of performance: 1
dryly mr potter: 1
and he moved: 1
it looked it: 1
absolutely unacceptable and: 1
just a crying: 1
what you see: 1
hermione stood still: 1
stair she nodded: 1
granger the fact: 1
with just telling: 1
course i would: 1
seemed to see: 1
house for her: 1
held it and: 1
lost he would: 1
up knocking on: 1
think she left: 1
i mean i'm: 1
were hopeless they: 1
wasn't feeling very: 1
a chance to: 1
professor mcgonagall also: 1
away from everyone: 1
use for something: 1
flowing stone gargoyles: 1
down for a: 1
for around three: 1
your fault or: 1
it really mattered: 1
cheeks grew a: 1
of hogwarts professor: 1
other things and: 1
of myself i: 1
see her as: 1
of older students: 1
top of mount: 1
of what other: 1
i'd like to: 1
any more you're: 1
her feet pattering: 1
she wondered what: 1
ways you could: 1
for her to: 1
sterner stuff than: 1
you cannot imagine: 1
belongs to someone: 1
you're helping harry: 1
couldn't and then: 1
that harry potter: 1
suspend judgment you: 1
stair stopped turning: 1
we become who: 1
was invincible but: 1
what you said: 1
face in hopes: 1
misfortune to remember: 1
pleased indeed that: 1
wearing except his: 1
that her voice: 1
not something you: 1
miss granger hermione's: 1
them with the: 1
he was trying: 1
even know where: 1
she would be: 1
older - maybe: 1
harry potter she: 1
wizard sighed miss: 1
potter would never: 1
i have been: 1
blood even though: 1
me said hermione: 1
lead me i: 1
violate some kind: 1
dumbledore will be: 1
nearly all of: 1
fingers of course: 1
do better because: 1
even understand the: 1
all only serene: 1
granger said dumbledore: 1
because hogwarts was: 1
so ubiquitous that: 1
search your excellent: 1
began revolving around: 1
serene and with: 1
your own person: 1
things that could: 1
understand the difference: 1
their school year: 1
and she said: 1
least one chaotic: 1
you on an: 1
how it seemed: 1
what blurted hermione: 1
kept on trying: 1
is not something: 1
armies combined this: 1
when you fell: 1
the old wizard's: 1
don't think it's: 1
wands from their: 1
on trying sometimes: 1
knew about harry's: 1
those words that: 1
headmaster harry potter: 1
up said the: 1
matter you would: 1
- said hermione: 1
permitted to pretend: 1
professor mcgonagall spoke: 1
malfoy that was: 1
thought in every: 1
stairs turned around: 1
are twelve okay: 1
it was a: 1
circumscribed by crippling: 1
what seems to: 1
you're going to: 1
kind of crazy: 1
a very short: 1
have belonged to: 1
thought of it: 1
up there will: 1
it wasn't her: 1
order miss granger: 1
than for anything: 1
into tears and: 1
- so if: 1
a lot after: 1
you were fought: 1
- and i: 1
how long but: 1
too ah said: 1
he was going: 1
hermione is it: 1
she wondered if: 1
into her ear: 1
the moment the: 1
about it because: 1
she didn't even: 1
she went right: 1
were suddenly piercing: 1
opening the way: 1
could climb it: 1
mistake about other: 1
you would rather: 1
up close the: 1
off everything they: 1
comprehend what goes: 1
thing miss granger: 1
become the sort: 1
it what happened: 1
did not wholly: 1
classes this entire: 1
let either of: 1
- miss greengrass: 1
negative two hundred: 1
swallowed up and: 1
granger on almost: 1
i didn't run: 1
on general principles: 1
history books miss: 1
latin engraved words: 1
- and -: 1
professor sighed nonetheless: 1
malfoy united your: 1
kept on coming: 1
slowly for someone: 1
you in my: 1
she did in: 1
the day of: 1
discover that you: 1
potential you must: 1
the habits of: 1
her voice stuck: 1
all the fear: 1
yet and she: 1
would have been: 1
air of resignation: 1
to be me: 1
whole army being: 1
didn't run away: 1
outright that you: 1
you said that: 1
people become who: 1
hermione granger walked: 1
was distracted by: 1
hermione looked for: 1
a side of: 1
trembling because it: 1
about that you: 1
didn't know who: 1
dumbledore i was: 1
free transfiguration and: 1
great oaken door: 1
- her voice: 1
beat nearly everyone: 1
a ball with: 1
potentially killed someone: 1
revolves around him: 1
at all and: 1
door faded out: 1
where mr malfoy: 1
with an inquiring: 1
has won and: 1
how to cast: 1
blue eyes had: 1
in hogwarts who: 1
because she was: 1
they have their: 1
a friend will: 1
have to live: 1

she wasn't crying: 1
you did not: 1
he has won: 1
as much of: 1
but there was: 1
before no one: 1

he knew about: 1
and making hermione: 1
ubiquitous that hermione's: 1
you true never: 1
wizard's voice was: 1
looking for and: 1
about it some: 1
now that it: 1
the correct dueling: 1
might become fear: 1
it is unexpected: 1
harry's voice said: 1
one can stop: 1
a crisp voice: 1
that harry looked: 1
his shoulder he: 1
said hermione they: 1
in hopes it: 1
hermione said her: 1
that this might: 1
breath to stop: 1
and lack of: 1

all the world: 1
back with a: 1
speaking despite her: 1
that of the: 1

fortunate are those: 1
second floor and: 1
- she didn't: 1
and she felt: 1
who you are: 1
and when it: 1
world revolves around: 1
someone made of: 1
ever worried or: 1
glossed right over: 1
burden which you: 1
a quest -: 1
didn't have the: 1
harry potter wouldn't: 1

seconds later that: 1
with a renewed: 1
much older -: 1
said people become: 1

quirrell said with: 1
could help well: 1
dumbledore tapping his: 1
described how harry: 1
lion and snake: 1
is an astonishingly: 1
i don't think: 1
trying her hardest: 1
childish frets over: 1
which was inscribed: 1
rose from his: 1
tapped sharply on: 1
room some time: 1
everyone was expecting: 1
negotiation the words: 1
her head rapidly: 1
she could ask: 1
do to help: 1
be because they: 1
of sight behind: 1
almost gotten to: 1
could beat nearly: 1
of the headmaster: 1
think not dumbledore's: 1
stayed strong on: 1
if there is: 1
make the hard: 1
happier if i: 1
winning against harry: 1
i wasn't pretending: 1
potter she was: 1
only not really: 1
in those mild: 1

been scared of: 1
finite incantatem on: 1
when no muggles: 1
had them if: 1
whose point she'd: 1

stepped out into: 1
been indignant at: 1
staircase that climbed: 1
on his desk: 1
not really but: 1
and raven and: 1
to someone else: 1
in 1733 by: 1
such rules the: 1
some more is: 1
refuse to do: 1
right now if: 1
it was she: 1
certain similarities to: 1
any reason -: 1
words the old: 1
been nervous about: 1
was a little: 1
are not right: 1
she shouldn't have: 1
why was fawkes: 1
the thousand alternatives: 1
hold her breath: 1
said hermione i: 1
sometimes they believed: 1
their mere possessions: 1
make us chase: 1
she couldn't and: 1
couldn't answer it: 1
- you get: 1
too eager to: 1
vision all blurry: 1
- she wasn't: 1
help anyone become: 1
i knew such: 1
professor quirrell gazed: 1
so after hermione: 1
little enough miss: 1
over the transfiguration: 1
him with a: 1
head snapped around: 1
snake and badger: 1
on steepled hands: 1
being just harry: 1
around him and: 1
not only never: 1
could have had: 1
going over the: 1
fifth-year parchment with: 1
sight behind the: 1
was surprised that: 1
not grow up: 1
were distracted by: 1
continuously upward hermione: 1
and hermione granger: 1
look harry in: 1
memory for a: 1
duel wars do: 1
was not what: 1
it would do: 1
general potter against: 1
happened to him: 1
to draco malfoy: 1
some kind of: 1
angry hermione or: 1
necessary to achieve: 1
thought once that: 1
be making the: 1
voice said urgently: 1
though her memory: 1
hermione began speaking: 1
not subject to: 1
remember elizabeth beckett: 1
friend - and: 1
than i to: 1
saw the flash: 1
my decision as: 1
the faded snake: 1
students now she: 1
when a knock: 1
go if the: 1
on she would: 1
that was why: 1
way over some: 1
and pointed to: 1
slytherin dumbledore frowned: 1
perceives certain similarities: 1
tell you outright: 1
hand which had: 1
myself i'm sorry: 1
rapidly shook her: 1
to pursue mr: 1
a child hermione: 1
it only that: 1
your army including: 1
clever if she: 1
same sort of: 1
no one would: 1
beating you that: 1
up and crying: 1
said dumbledore tapping: 1
goes through people's: 1
crippling fear that: 1
she didn't say: 1
answer when a: 1
to lead me: 1
eyes had glossed: 1
been holding back: 1
didn't follow minerva: 1
would say such: 1
be i think: 1
dark wizards to: 1
and everything else: 1
when dumbledore's voice: 1
they continued to: 1
the wall so: 1
not your fault: 1
was how she'd: 1
and held it: 1
you said to: 1
eyes had grown: 1
to change what: 1
gotten to the: 1
wizard not her: 1
with an error: 1
first year of: 1
i do not: 1
repeat the same: 1
hermione that this: 1
blurry ran so: 1
crying yet not: 1
able to annihilate: 1
more seemed to: 1
was an important: 1
by doing what: 1
that - harry's: 1
for a quest: 1
headmaster she was: 1
the three armies: 1
was wearing armor: 1
quirrell said from: 1
in time the: 1
professor mcgonagall finally: 1
two of us: 1
old wizard more: 1
me alone she: 1
yet hermione granger: 1
hold back for: 1
tapping his finger: 1
door in front: 1
the stone walls: 1
he's got no: 1
did i call: 1
ear you're going: 1
by the habits: 1
while she was: 1
all your army's: 1
not invoke the: 1
malfoy or miss: 1
be harry's friend: 1
lack of thought: 1
badger and making: 1
nodded and i'll: 1
a moment to: 1
and force them: 1
defeating two chaotic: 1
potter's company hermione: 1
in the castle: 1
you to such: 1
mild half-glassed eyes: 1
then why was: 1
need to ask: 1
words she'd never: 1
around her and: 1
arram sabeti who'd: 1
then you will: 1
you get swallowed: 1
anything you can: 1
walked right past: 1
like harry potter: 1
her office hours: 1
professor mcgonagall rapidly: 1
always be afraid: 1
time there was: 1
and crying even: 1
tapped the faded: 1
hot ball of: 1
and hermione felt: 1
lion and then: 1
granger you are: 1
i have you: 1
her continuously upward: 1
a little too: 1
making hermione wince: 1
taken a very: 1
started wondering if: 1
mr potter i: 1
was wiped out: 1
anyone become the: 1
other spells she: 1
during her first: 1
blood flaming in: 1
a little heat: 1
hopes on your: 1
a word really: 1
shoulder reassuringly yes: 1
that you and: 1
over and over: 1
nodded slowly it: 1
that shield was: 1
of hogwarts do: 1
was - when: 1
of witchcraft and: 1
hero and a: 1
his fingers tapped: 1
to isolate miss: 1
a ravenclaw tapping: 1
i tried a: 1
you knew what: 1
opened without being: 1
just thought we'd: 1
her thoughts and: 1
bellatrix black hermione: 1
quite as healthy: 1
through established charms: 1
you are far: 1
today you beat: 1
harry looked as: 1
hermione's head snapped: 1
daphne did i: 1
even dream of: 1
around him he: 1
have done and: 1
a few seconds: 1
of walking away: 1
you to rise: 1
in the middle: 1
happened to her: 1
themselves because they: 1
is unfortunate but: 1
answer couldn't answer: 1
upon his throne: 1
he looked a: 1
asking me for: 1
a tightness in: 1
you see miss: 1
armies to present: 1
the way so: 1
phoenix had been: 1
now demonstrated twice: 1
helped him little: 1
is what heroes: 1
the castle excuse: 1
combined this leaves: 1
not - she'd: 1
bright and eager: 1
spoke that is: 1
urgently she wasn't: 1
when it reached: 1
in miss granger: 1
have the words: 1
walked away she: 1
lot like a: 1
was a hot: 1
through ignorance and: 1
live inside someone: 1
friend because he's: 1
could running as: 1
scare you i: 1
one of the: 1
stone gargoyles stepped: 1
be because they're: 1
saying or doing: 1
mr potter did: 1
and then turn: 1
been talking about: 1
couldn't be right: 1
before i was: 1
never let either: 1
away from if: 1
very nice right: 1
burning sensation was: 1
very lined you: 1
every time -: 1
dumbledore's finger tapped: 1
professor quirrell would: 1
that mr potter: 1
around us redunds: 1
companion i just: 1
as a professor: 1
glasses and she: 1
soldiers were distracted: 1
i cannot say: 1
accomplish everything they: 1
than both of: 1
and had slid: 1
people are afraid: 1
mr malfoy united: 1
your path yet: 1
and perhaps the: 1
was going over: 1
that was worth: 1
door have you: 1
as her while: 1
been a thousand: 1
had changed in: 1
i was invincible: 1
her memory insisted: 1
hermione they walked: 1
the whole world: 1
farther away from: 1
break loose if: 1
sees you any: 1
her while draco: 1
glance at professor: 1
hermione granger was: 1
she'd never been: 1
miss granger all: 1
go now please: 1
wouldn't show -: 1
will select eight: 1
beyond the point: 1
it some more: 1
was while she: 1
beside her sounding: 1
her footsteps stop: 1
to fight your: 1
usually use for: 1
faded out of: 1
felt that way: 1
the corridor forked: 1
old it looked: 1
badly things could: 1
to rebalance the: 1
but it is: 1
what you can: 1
the hero of: 1
and then there: 1
of the dark: 1
tears and from: 1
they needed to: 1
shouldn't have to: 1
girl started to: 1
much well professor: 1
to rise to: 1
granger all the: 1
witchcraft and wizardry: 1
like an angry: 1
that it is: 1
right now hermione: 1
fawkes had been: 1
with noble and: 1
chaos legion has: 1
and the two: 1
inside someone else's: 1
contest he lost: 1
other armies combined: 1
of losing their: 1
and when he: 1
once and that: 1
to be because: 1
and had just: 1
wizard and tell: 1
miss granger hermione: 1
of sterner stuff: 1
was a mysterious: 1
but it had: 1
all folk ignore: 1
was the silver-bearded: 1
you are harry's: 1
i'm twelve harry's: 1
i'm not saying: 1
nice right now: 1
were still precise: 1
i'll do -: 1
general malfoy for: 1
thought we'd slow: 1
started walking again: 1
mcgonagall the older: 1
girl to both: 1
alas but only: 1
that it had: 1
i'm just -: 1
tall order miss: 1
be through ignorance: 1
they were meant: 1
at them sharp: 1
would wound him: 1
to be far: 1
sighed miss granger: 1
defeat for you: 1
in its rule: 1
as she spoke: 1
us chase you: 1
won miss granger: 1
thinking a lot: 1
whatever he was: 1
to be like: 1
said with heavy: 1
guessed why i've: 1
i know i: 1
and tell you: 1
pattern as mr: 1
- he was: 1
the headmaster was: 1
said draco malfoy: 1
eyes seemed to: 1
died opening the: 1
mr malfoy did: 1
holding back harry: 1
snapped around and: 1
sabeti who'd lived: 1
now what happened: 1
didn't have any: 1
they must never: 1
or removed -: 1
she'd said ah: 1
else in their: 1
out sounding stern: 1
looked like an: 1
explodes with opportunities: 1
few weeks since: 1
stuff than i: 1
look in those: 1
even as the: 1
do mr potter: 1
to explain -: 1
of course it: 1
quirrell said dryly: 1
was a tightness: 1
to cry i: 1
did in fact: 1
the first corner: 1
front of them: 1
hexes governed by: 1
is stronger than: 1
would still be: 1
i call you: 1
and badger and: 1
companion if you: 1
she left the: 1
that but it: 1
glaring at harry: 1
was what she'd: 1
she wouldn't be: 1
and professor quirrell: 1
to reveal the: 1
face had grown: 1
an astonishingly rare: 1
harry i didn't: 1
by crippling fear: 1
but at least: 1
you beat my: 1
that he knew: 1
the faded badger: 1
that the defense: 1
the wall with: 1
am not harry's: 1
wizard smiled again: 1
mr malfoy had: 1
spoke on the: 1
but only his: 1
fear of death: 1
the hard decisions: 1
have no idea: 1
that he wouldn't: 1
penetrating his fingers: 1
to present him: 1
mr malfoy has: 1
most terrible thing: 1
if you knew: 1
like she was: 1
if you get: 1
rule the defense: 1
then the thought: 1
tears only not: 1
stone wall and: 1
like it had: 1
can stop you: 1
easier spells that: 1
walls i wasn't: 1
now a high: 1
that climbed to: 1
at him but: 1
legion has now: 1
they left hogwarts: 1
congratulations nonetheless miss: 1
swarm mr potter: 1
the dark wizards: 1
wasn't really expecting: 1
you choose to: 1
thousand hufflepuff bones: 1
didn't say anything: 1
to him you: 1
the wrong thing: 1
anymore draco malfoy: 1
learn to suspend: 1
granger i have: 1
sounding stern but: 1
to beat you: 1
come up with: 1
and snake and: 1
ever going to: 1
i think not: 1
right came a: 1
that's not -: 1
if daphne hadn't: 1
do maybe the: 1
i've decided to: 1
to such extremes: 1
his desk rap-rap: 1
all break loose: 1
fought to a: 1
possessions fear of: 1
person so they: 1
a thousand hufflepuff: 1
might have proved: 1
later that maybe: 1
quirrell points but: 1
like right now: 1
the fact remains: 1
blurted hermione we: 1
why professor mcgonagall: 1
the oaken door: 1
you were beating: 1
door disrupted her: 1
are those like: 1
better because i: 1
it looked like: 1
did i not: 1
stuck i'll i'll: 1
old wizard in: 1
present him with: 1
against the wall: 1
to negative two: 1
endless stair stopped: 1
like to go: 1
hero of this: 1
near harry -: 1
her a chance: 1
that nothing had: 1
terribly sorry miss: 1
twelve that was: 1
one would hear: 1
to help me: 1
hermione heard her: 1
do but -: 1
draco malfoy went: 1
be like that: 1
had changed since: 1
and you will: 1
set inside other: 1
astonishingly rare realization: 1
than socrates know: 1
her to learn: 1
up like he: 1
had your soldiers: 1
and her hand: 1
coming and ran: 1
harry potter someone: 1
afterward had washed: 1
wasn't holding back: 1
happened the girl: 1
and how it: 1
wondering if there: 1
hard question a: 1
think you would: 1
her face in: 1
to become there: 1
friends then can: 1
direction looking like: 1
way down when: 1
they should be: 1
being scary how: 1
to cast their: 1
a bit excuse: 1
he probably couldn't: 1
company hermione shook: 1
hear her and: 1
what she'd said: 1
were fought to: 1
voice was shaking: 1
dozen easier spells: 1
select eight soldiers: 1
ended up knocking: 1
and i'll she: 1
was gentle and: 1
to annihilate just: 1
around to face: 1
worthy to lead: 1
difference she had: 1
precision your contest: 1
out that boy: 1
resigned some people: 1
remembered as his: 1
resigned general potter: 1
wizard arram sabeti: 1
stone as fast: 1
it would require: 1
was much older: 1
when they are: 1
reassuringly on hermione's: 1
general flying into: 1
mcgonagall about how: 1
granger i'm not: 1
miss granger can: 1
of crazy law: 1
if i could: 1
i never let: 1
granger but you're: 1
and cheeks puffed: 1
and that he: 1
was anyone else: 1
army and the: 1
opened them he: 1
to hermione that: 1
hufflepuff bones waiting: 1
fair she said: 1
things and that: 1
socrates know thyself: 1
a symbol on: 1
asking him would: 1
both of you: 1
voice stopped it: 1
- hermione stood: 1
his friends there: 1
her legs drawn: 1
dominated all of: 1
be - her: 1
in the eyes: 1
two chaotic legionnaires: 1
be just a: 1
right now or: 1
question is what: 1
of hero that: 1
with its eyes: 1
her from over: 1
stair began revolving: 1
once - yes: 1
it had drawers: 1
would burst into: 1
right now of: 1
professor couldn't help: 1
other people will: 1
we be equal: 1
have read history: 1
all my classes: 1
i can keep: 1
hufflepuff would say: 1
for the third: 1
tasks and they: 1
came out sounding: 1
not what godric: 1
you like the: 1
this might be: 1
i still want: 1
i think he: 1
like you compared: 1
eyes when he: 1
tricks i'd been: 1
going to make: 1
irony since miss: 1
you can truly: 1
it was worth: 1
around with a: 1
people's minds when: 1
hermione i mean: 1
not at her: 1
was stupid that: 1
it had only: 1
from coming out: 1
is a hero's: 1
your full abilities: 1
one perceives certain: 1
voice didn't break: 1
the same sort: 1
lead perhaps he: 1
why he needs: 1
chilly stone wall: 1
very clear what: 1
knocker opened without: 1
is what you: 1
calm precision your: 1
had his head: 1
because quirrell's right: 1
just - if: 1
must exercise your: 1
of mistake about: 1
how our much-loved: 1
she wasn't looking: 1
probably couldn't help: 1
old wizard nodded: 1
seem like a: 1
a pattering of: 1
is not entitled: 1
notes that nearly: 1
mcgonagall spoke on: 1
she described how: 1
professor leaned forward: 1
his shoulder when: 1
plans she could: 1
anyone you understand: 1
being - something: 1
force as you: 1
she said it: 1
you were hermione: 1
you down for: 1
shaking but she: 1
sitting upright had: 1
added or removed: 1
looked a little: 1
here general potter: 1
you would not: 1
mr malfoy and: 1
girl who entered: 1
harry from beside: 1
lost spirit when: 1
be forced to: 1
it wouldn't show: 1
- what's right: 1
what answer the: 1
special said the: 1
did not think: 1
the number of: 1
over but apparently: 1
would come up: 1
worth trying to: 1
i shall be: 1
in succession military: 1
- her whole: 1
had only taken: 1
slower his expression: 1
would hear her: 1
by firing on: 1
two soldiers had: 1
old wizard they: 1
and that is: 1
like the right: 1
would have to: 1
a revolving helix: 1
her head and: 1
her it couldn't: 1
they were hopeless: 1
not quite realize: 1
they live their: 1
granger they have: 1
are far beyond: 1
i should come: 1
but - her: 1
had thought to: 1
didn't even know: 1
of you only: 1
someone during her: 1
got a little: 1
perhaps beyond healing: 1
wizard in the: 1
and they must: 1
any further and: 1
now hermione didn't: 1
potter and mr: 1
quirrell had praised: 1
you can do: 1
be lost in: 1
to find words: 1
short time as: 1
terribly perhaps beyond: 1
friends there was: 1
if i was: 1
violate a habit: 1
dared with her: 1
decided not to: 1
yes said professor: 1
being touched behind: 1
hermione's shoulder please: 1
not sure -: 1
she nodded and: 1
that had seemed: 1
him but his: 1
she'd been told: 1
right past him: 1
time i have: 1
at the folly: 1
tapped the lion: 1
elizabeth beckett who: 1
harry's friend -: 1
are not if: 1
she was reminded: 1
someone had plugged: 1
invoke the correct: 1
both other armies: 1
to winning against: 1
griffin knocker opened: 1
sure now that: 1
fear is a: 1
as head of: 1
my capacity as: 1
roof the chaos: 1
hard decisions and: 1
maybe the thought: 1
- yes said: 1
with dozens of: 1
rebalance the three: 1
middle of trying: 1
gazed at her: 1
but that was: 1
brought her here: 1
older than before: 1
the defense professor's: 1
to violate a: 1
occurred to hermione: 1
in your day: 1
so terribly sorry: 1
was losing something: 1
been told after: 1
have seen what: 1
they never noticed: 1
thought she could: 1
just exactly as: 1
seen what you: 1
grindelwald and fewer: 1
voice trembling that: 1
once that i: 1
level and you: 1
friends might think: 1
if there was: 1
no muggles could: 1
trying very very: 1
with nervousness as: 1
defense professor's office: 1
path leads that: 1
something else and: 1
to discover that: 1
man said with: 1
a knock at: 1
i'm only twelve: 1
sad little bug: 1
important reason i: 1
all the other: 1
your friends might: 1
the words the: 1
she was distracted: 1
well-reasoned but at: 1
brian dumbledore into: 1

even though he: 1
her face looked: 1
wiped out by: 1

the world around: 1

only you can: 1
house points afterward: 1
silly little game: 1

as stern as: 1
paler and he: 1
and so the: 1
the last time: 1
washed her face: 1
in all my: 1
though sitting upright: 1
though it probably: 1
little with nervousness: 1
felt a little: 1
i'm sorry it's: 1
mcgonagall's face it: 1
that it of: 1
after she woke: 1
the wizard arram: 1
people will think: 1
his shoulder and: 1
harry potter's mysterious: 1
lips together tightly: 1
mcgonagall it had: 1
and hold her: 1
too near harry: 1
that was how: 1
time - and: 1
climbed a flight: 1
drive you to: 1
to shut her: 1
and then afterward: 1
this whole time: 1
with anyone you: 1
eyes blinked several: 1
i could have: 1
with a mere: 1
you are meant: 1
then one notes: 1
the room some: 1

hermione burst out: 1
you could always: 1
to harry if: 1
yet worthy to: 1
to do it: 1

twice in succession: 1
him and she: 1
by two soldiers: 1

defense class -: 1
against harry when: 1
what contest he: 1

hermione i'm not: 1
though he was: 1
mr potter that: 1
bore her continuously: 1
you who or: 1
mr potter's suit: 1
was never ever: 1
and even if: 1
then it meant: 1
it probably wasn't: 1
be the hero: 1
together professor quirrell: 1
moment the wooden: 1
had been trained: 1
that is the: 1
the girl started: 1
- she'd always: 1
the moment you: 1
looking at him: 1
convoluted answer when: 1
she curled up: 1
no matter what: 1
full potential you: 1
grew a little: 1
wizard they live: 1
muggles could climb: 1
potter would have: 1
original that people: 1
professor's office with: 1
learn to your: 1
with helplessness she: 1
could go if: 1
to explain it's: 1
potter turn to: 1
- the old: 1
what she thought: 1
hogwarts do not: 1
- particularly not: 1
it would wound: 1
i ween that: 1
got close to: 1
boy just kept: 1
her hand still: 1
can decide that: 1
third time and: 1
afraid to do: 1
oaken desk with: 1
a gryffindor would: 1
bug that had: 1
that had just: 1
even if he: 1
you're just something: 1
and draco malfoy: 1
wearing armor -: 1
her lips together: 1
more glory on: 1
miss granger but: 1
and trying very: 1
win she didn't: 1
about how harry: 1
of their united: 1
through and yet: 1
would require them: 1
around behind her: 1
of drawers facing: 1
thought to try: 1
this was something: 1
friends can i: 1
not what i: 1
with a sad: 1
looked like right: 1
it that had: 1
something you can: 1
shall be less: 1
my whole army: 1
same failed strategy: 1
their tasks and: 1
in latin engraved: 1
ran so that: 1
i've asked you: 1
of the day: 1
of course i: 1
raven would repeat: 1
wooden door faded: 1
roof you were: 1
fear of what: 1
become fear of: 1
still stumbled a: 1
be a bad: 1
his voice sounded: 1
and not hold: 1
up - and: 1
why and harry: 1
behind her even: 1
no one it's: 1
cheeks puffed what: 1
not dumbledore's finger: 1
just no one: 1
dragon army and: 1
just barged ahead: 1
harry back then: 1
fight someone i: 1
compared to heroes: 1
not right said: 1
excuse me said: 1
i that -: 1
professor mcgonagall it: 1
engraved words whose: 1
stop and then: 1
grindelwald you have: 1
a man but: 1
contest is over: 1
mcgonagall also wasn't: 1
footsteps behind her: 1
else's shadow like: 1
close to winning: 1
her was that: 1
she should've tried: 1
up because of: 1
without being touched: 1
question a gryffindor: 1
done to gentle: 1
both our armies: 1
albus dumbledore's voice: 1
you win she: 1
a hard question: 1
invented in 1733: 1
play miss granger: 1
sorry hermione granger: 1
what she'd been: 1
all the work: 1
wizard that is: 1
never will you: 1
them and that: 1
hadn't fainted -: 1
unravel a particularly: 1
changed in the: 1
to do maybe: 1
the middle of: 1
anything else i: 1
who they should: 1
was reminded of: 1
forced to miss: 1
neither she nor: 1
by the wizard: 1
not to change: 1
challenge if you: 1
you told them: 1
to stop it: 1
as mr malfoy: 1
mount everest in: 1
clearly been crying: 1
rather be the: 1
she was never: 1
shouldn't have taken: 1
the phoenix had: 1
her breath to: 1
had stayed strong: 1
them to chase: 1
told her that: 1
quirrell gazed at: 1
who died opening: 1
bit - she: 1
wasn't sure how: 1
old wizard i: 1
castle excuse me: 1
an equal level: 1
out again she: 1
fair hermione said: 1
own than in: 1
she decided not: 1
a little hoarse: 1
trembling that i've: 1
in a wavering: 1
it couldn't really: 1
opposed grindelwald you: 1
a dozen easier: 1
more and more: 1
think the headmaster: 1
around her once: 1
killed someone during: 1
it and ran: 1
who entered her: 1
his head i: 1
less dignity and: 1
extremes she couldn't: 1
their hands mr: 1
maybe she did: 1
- professor quirrell: 1
ambitions but then: 1
it is terribly: 1
marked down to: 1
make harry fight: 1
tightness in her: 1
i shouldn't have: 1
has guessed why: 1
rather wryly miss: 1
school year and: 1
up to her: 1
no choice general: 1
to him and: 1
telling professor mcgonagall: 1
shoulder gently turning: 1
potter wouldn't have: 1
his everyone thinks: 1
last few weeks: 1
before they left: 1
know that better: 1
stunning hex and: 1
not asking for: 1
one sees you: 1
used up enough: 1
how she'd ended: 1
who or why: 1
himself in front: 1
on professor mcgonagall's: 1
her even as: 1
had brought her: 1
have potentially killed: 1
his throne stepped: 1
and hermione had: 1
in grownup situations: 1
as they could: 1
she climbed a: 1
right for you: 1
wouldn't usually use: 1
law by firing: 1
of trying to: 1
the three of: 1
began speaking despite: 1
larger army and: 1
eager to grow: 1
is there any: 1
crush her was: 1
the stunning hex: 1
albus dumbledore will: 1
too lazy to: 1
fast as they: 1
i to make: 1
she'd been in: 1
seemed like the: 1
can i be: 1
hero's companion i: 1
the difference she: 1
needed to talk: 1
what quest said: 1
continues in its: 1
still had that: 1
in every lost: 1
getting the same: 1
malfoy for not: 1
the original that: 1
desperate whisper from: 1
her because he: 1
granger if you: 1
sharpened into spears: 1
with harry said: 1
were able to: 1
front of her: 1
like professor mcgonagall: 1
do not grow: 1
and crush her: 1
her hand and: 1
defense professor couldn't: 1
potter did not: 1
what happened professor: 1
since fawkes had: 1
then there was: 1
wizard as you: 1
not getting the: 1
it meant everyone: 1
said albus dumbledore's: 1
was told that: 1
of stairs and: 1
a little older: 1
as for what: 1
be able to: 1
try anything unusual: 1
sounded like he: 1
because when she'd: 1
desperate whisper i: 1
when it really: 1
rather be lost: 1
to put in: 1
despite her newfound: 1
she is remembered: 1
standstill so that: 1
against harry and: 1
this mr potter: 1
them he looked: 1
army two soldiers: 1
said hermione her: 1
something of his: 1
quest said hermione: 1
drawers set inside: 1
are there you: 1
and physically wrest: 1
up nervously at: 1
harry and neville: 1
his eyes and: 1
dumbledore that is: 1
said with calm: 1
to her and: 1
hermione didn't have: 1
their way and: 1
his companion if: 1
would all break: 1
into his dark: 1
challenge professor quirrell: 1
why did i: 1
gryffindor would say: 1
trying to do: 1
folly of older: 1
a bad idea: 1
drawn up and: 1
change what she'd: 1
on fire thinking: 1
folk ignore because: 1
on the faded: 1
invincible but that: 1
else i have: 1
her shoulder gently: 1
in her face: 1
be worse the: 1
you are not: 1
hermione said professor: 1
they didn't she: 1
that i've got: 1
facing in every: 1
stern but then: 1
going to lose: 1
reason - particularly: 1
not sure the: 1
that - doesn't: 1
piercing beneath the: 1
into spears if: 1
black oaken desk: 1
was mistaken miss: 1
i walk back: 1
so they lost: 1
her and i: 1
saying it's what: 1
not have permitted: 1
what goes through: 1
looked as shocked: 1
i'd only figured: 1
unacceptable and professor: 1
- something that: 1
behind her if: 1
done and perhaps: 1
gryffindor would have: 1
old wizard sighed: 1
isn't a fair: 1
is anything that: 1
a fifth-year parchment: 1
said harry's voice: 1
harry's friend as: 1
about glory it's: 1
grown sadder as: 1
that professor quirrell: 1
little lower i: 1
removed - the: 1
now of course: 1
wall but congratulations: 1
dark side once: 1
i - harry: 1
is not subject: 1
but right now: 1
potter was beating: 1
a hero myself: 1
is it okay: 1
then can we: 1
he did not: 1
precise but the: 1
older witch's voice: 1
been trying her: 1
quirrell said harry: 1
behind her hermione: 1
the last few: 1
and put himself: 1
are asking me: 1
knocking on professor: 1
anything i just: 1
the one to: 1
with the brass: 1
to suspend judgment: 1
choice general potter: 1
longbottom and physically: 1
he was losing: 1
the professor of: 1
because he's got: 1
her face that: 1
i let out: 1
wryly miss granger: 1
in the last: 1
holding back in: 1
did not quite: 1
worse the endless: 1
and hermione heard: 1
eyes were suddenly: 1
even look harry: 1
force them to: 1
whose gently twinkling: 1
as she described: 1
very hard not: 1
just go into: 1
the corridors of: 1
that time i: 1
tired him his: 1
lower i wasn't: 1
was a long: 1
in fact frightened: 1
already tired him: 1
wasn't even close: 1
worthy of it: 1
toward a staircase: 1
to be harry's: 1
miss granger there: 1
them if daphne: 1
day of the: 1
feeling was creeping: 1
the stairs turned: 1
is right the: 1
with her lungs: 1
smile but you: 1
our much-loved ministry: 1
of performance i: 1
must grow strong: 1
time the name: 1
how badly things: 1
every direction looking: 1
beaten her whole: 1
you were just: 1
chainmail and everything: 1
an unjust world: 1
i'm only -: 1
above all the: 1
a staircase that: 1
soldiers swarm mr: 1
if she lost: 1
two of them: 1
you prove worthy: 1
you have no: 1
made of sterner: 1
quirrell's eyes chilled: 1
is right for: 1
only serene and: 1
he would say: 1
at least one: 1
things could go: 1
- you are: 1
pause and then: 1
soon as you: 1
physically wrest the: 1
so that no: 1
feet pattering across: 1
desk rap-rap i: 1
say such things: 1
said i was: 1
frightened and nervous: 1
tell the headmaster: 1
how had she: 1
for what it: 1
of course said: 1
a hero and: 1
to say a: 1
said urgently she: 1
high desperate whisper: 1
instead she didn't: 1
it's suspicious that: 1
didn't understand and: 1
though her hand: 1
did i cannot: 1
puffed what happened: 1
and most ancient: 1
- i tried: 1
1733 by the: 1
a sad one: 1
had a feeling: 1
that later i'm: 1
him you may: 1
deny them you: 1
in the back: 1
hours but it: 1
a habit of: 1
she had almost: 1
seemed to look: 1
smiled only you: 1
at professor mcgonagall: 1
you know it's: 1
any way i: 1
well said dumbledore: 1
twelve okay said: 1
no one else: 1
she was a: 1
after she hadn't: 1
on the way: 1
out of sight: 1
stop being harry's: 1
up free transfiguration: 1
this year and: 1
went around with: 1
glory on your: 1
for anything else: 1
was like that: 1
as he had: 1
on the wall: 1
too awful to: 1
hotter that -: 1
her cheeks grew: 1
and desperate whisper: 1
as harry potter's: 1
them or deny: 1
that asking him: 1
insisted that nothing: 1
it's not fair: 1
united force as: 1
around three seconds: 1
a larger army: 1
professor mcgonagall her: 1
dementor when dumbledore's: 1
and professor mcgonagall: 1
monday and had: 1
never been able: 1
fifty death eaters: 1
cry i wasn't: 1
them to violate: 1
time she'd been: 1
crazy law by: 1
whole lives circumscribed: 1
of your house: 1
yes said dumbledore: 1
military strength equal: 1
that shouldn't have: 1
error that could: 1
eager and kept: 1
making the same: 1
respect such rules: 1
looked it suddenly: 1
what other people: 1
had felt worried: 1
about and she'd: 1
afterward they continued: 1
who you truly: 1
okay said hermione: 1
she was trying: 1
so today you: 1
aloud dumbledore closed: 1
be by myself: 1
for that is: 1
his throne albus: 1
leave me alone: 1
granger i did: 1
was something like: 1
said as soon: 1
lose to draco: 1
didn't answer couldn't: 1
me about harry: 1
right - she: 1
perhaps the name: 1
ahead doing whatever: 1
out into the: 1
someone to have: 1
she nor professor: 1
this play miss: 1
and not at: 1
a pause bellatrix: 1
inside other drawers: 1
at least he: 1
me to suspect: 1
so if she: 1
surprised that her: 1
stone walls i: 1
help me like: 1
something that belongs: 1
come in she: 1
a hero professor: 1
flying into a: 1
right through her: 1
you get too: 1
her hermione granger: 1
your house name: 1
a good idea: 1
mcgonagall had brought: 1
from beside her: 1
she didn't want: 1
slowly it is: 1
put up her: 1
soldiers the blood: 1
whisper i didn't: 1
thousand alternatives and: 1
not quite the: 1
our desires wherever: 1
she passed harry's: 1
voice got a: 1
tightly and hold: 1
be equal friends: 1
and you pinned: 1
you find more: 1
myself i wouldn't: 1
as she passed: 1
noble and most: 1
hopes it wouldn't: 1
stop it all: 1
oaken door have: 1
beyond healing but: 1
was worth trying: 1
trying sometimes they: 1
fact want to: 1
taken her anywhere: 1
as you know: 1
including at least: 1
either there was: 1
cry is professor: 1
it suddenly occurred: 1
a formal duel: 1
waiting to be: 1
figured out he: 1
still squeezed hermione's: 1
why he said: 1
down when the: 1
mean i'm not: 1
there you can: 1
and as she: 1
are and wherever: 1
better than i: 1
rise to the: 1
on daphne did: 1
does revolve around: 1
or doing the: 1
could not be: 1
miss granger if: 1
harry's friend alas: 1
afterward come in: 1
sardonic smile but: 1
and wizardry and: 1
him for real: 1
the misfortune to: 1
crisp voice the: 1
took a breath: 1
or you could: 1
only hermione granger: 1
now or good: 1
to give it: 1
granger i shall: 1
was a ravenclaw: 1
the start of: 1
but she wasn't: 1
the words were: 1
could have potentially: 1
who defeated grindelwald: 1
i would have: 1
from magical exhaustion: 1
been crying and: 1
would guess that: 1
as the door: 1
just resigned some: 1
i'll do but: 1
mind that he: 1
into a wall: 1
with her back: 1
if they are: 1
to scare you: 1
mcgonagall rapidly shook: 1
when he opened: 1
professor grinned mirthlessly: 1
is a most: 1
sight of their: 1
that the transfiguration: 1
a sleep hex: 1
praised general malfoy: 1
said that if: 1
voice was trembling: 1
professor flitwick would: 1
scary how had: 1
truly do mr: 1
course said professor: 1
of battle magic: 1
said she was: 1
one chaotic lieutenant: 1
to grow up: 1
desk with dozens: 1
were fighting for: 1
to cry is: 1
mr potter you: 1
again neither she: 1
i am annoyed: 1
granger was beating: 1
stopped turning the: 1
lungs on fire: 1
of course miss: 1
lived on top: 1
forces and yet: 1
an angry hermione: 1
professor for you: 1
was being scary: 1
hat offered you: 1
say said dumbledore: 1
young girl in: 1
her a few: 1
then she had: 1
that they must: 1
asked you here: 1
follow minerva was: 1
sounds of things: 1
came a high: 1
electrical cord into: 1
see a hero: 1
could always deduct: 1
her voice sounding: 1
they lost spirit: 1
granger said albus: 1
had beaten her: 1
the door slowly: 1
never noticed that: 1
him terribly perhaps: 1
that you have: 1
if i'd only: 1
remains that this: 1
won and it: 1
harry's dark side: 1
wall and her: 1
at professor mcgonagall's: 1
and from a: 1
a particularly convoluted: 1
than i that: 1
harry the old: 1
if you prove: 1
her at all: 1
heard her footsteps: 1
tower when she: 1
not to cry: 1
previous battle you: 1
and how old: 1
what her face: 1
curled up in: 1
did not search: 1
words whose point: 1
had seemed like: 1
their futile sleep: 1
work involved a: 1
the older witch's: 1
not childish frets: 1
potter and draco: 1
and his face: 1
this is my: 1
your professor for: 1
her and this: 1
that they were: 1
decide that miss: 1
who i cannot: 1
be too eager: 1
further and had: 1
harry was pulling: 1
wouldn't have been: 1
just to try: 1
quirrell's right you: 1
do anymore and: 1
godric gryffindor would: 1
been added or: 1
crying and then: 1
the wooden door: 1
say the same: 1
real the burning: 1
is usual for: 1
to be -: 1
brass griffin knocker: 1
minerva was going: 1
that belongs to: 1
hand still squeezed: 1
malfoy the dragon: 1
our armies as: 1
- she swallowed: 1
walking again walked: 1
rested his chin: 1
look in professor: 1
heavy irony since: 1
still not getting: 1
response was not: 1
you only mr: 1
that this is: 1
that professor mcgonagall: 1
number of things: 1
soldiers from your: 1
couldn't help anyone: 1
her and she: 1
at her from: 1

hogwarts professor mcgonagall: 1
a thousand times: 1
granger you have: 1
behind her leave: 1
the wise know: 1
a long space: 1

enough miss granger: 1
potter shot her: 1

little girl to: 1
granger can fight: 1
feeling that asking: 1

to be divided: 1
lives circumscribed by: 1
the hogwarts school: 1

door slowly creaked: 1
myself once before: 1
thinking while she: 1
the sort of: 1
after hermione had: 1
upright had already: 1
still and the: 1
a quiet voice: 1
his pathway then: 1
back then why: 1
hero professor flitwick: 1
that i knew: 1

you at once: 1
looked up nervously: 1
from his throne: 1
there any way: 1

open to reveal: 1
help and from: 1
old wizard that: 1
an electrical cord: 1
shield was and: 1
she started walking: 1
from then on: 1
one it's not: 1
while she curled: 1
let out a: 1
time later -: 1
thing as professor: 1
a hero but: 1
sorting hat offered: 1
than in harry: 1

in a crisp: 1
army including at: 1
as healthy as: 1

nervously at professor: 1
achieve their ambitions: 1
shoulder please tell: 1
i find it: 1
to demand that: 1
looked like she: 1
year and i: 1
hermione she took: 1
crying even if: 1
her hardest every: 1
didn't she was: 1
them before they: 1
right hermione said: 1
the same failed: 1
it is an: 1
him would be: 1
had been talking: 1
but that's not: 1
see happening to: 1
breath and held: 1
myself right now: 1
words were still: 1
a crying little: 1
the dementor when: 1
you will not: 1
me i thought: 1
that might have: 1
mcgonagall and even: 1
and wherever that: 1
office had clearly: 1
hermione her voice: 1
pretending i never: 1
two soldiers the: 1
everyone else in: 1
came to her: 1
voice stuck i'll: 1
badger and raven: 1
should be because: 1
yet not yet: 1
nodded well said: 1
or why she: 1
always deduct house: 1
she ever got: 1
charms and sometimes: 1
thinks the whole: 1
harry had changed: 1
is over he: 1
man but i: 1
desk and pointed: 1
another wondering if: 1
of thought in: 1
it of course: 1
i'll - she: 1
not harry's friend: 1
cuts off everything: 1
alternatives that professor: 1
you pleased indeed: 1
want to give: 1
her tell me: 1
by the sight: 1
like harry's darkness: 1
frets over what: 1
a whisper i'm: 1
glasses and his: 1
has forgotten what: 1
harry's friend because: 1
was in fact: 1
granger and if: 1
some people not: 1
annoyed to discover: 1
least he did: 1
so tell me: 1
seemed like harry: 1
professor mcgonagall's hand: 1
granger and it: 1
in your first: 1
thousand alternatives a: 1
with opportunities which: 1
was what she: 1
from their hands: 1
said dumbledore those: 1
a mere twenty-four: 1
had to pursue: 1
do to him: 1
draco said harry's: 1
i was ever: 1
several times beneath: 1
events surrounding harry: 1
chaotic lieutenant to: 1

harry when it: 1
pulling farther and: 1
a flight of: 1
friend as for: 1
strength equal to: 1

she had to: 1
your own than: 1
would say said: 1

answer the headmaster: 1
a lot like: 1
potter about us: 1
can be forced: 1
granger i don't: 1
quite realize his: 1

spears if you: 1
as she dared: 1
you here general: 1
as you wanted: 1
trying to count: 1

to ask whether: 1
the blood flaming: 1

he grew up: 1
uncomfortable about anything: 1

expecting you to: 1
and yet she: 1
not entitled to: 1

she tried to: 1
yet she is: 1
established charms and: 1
which you see: 1
him and as: 1
i want to: 1
like harry was: 1
would repeat those: 1
in all the: 1
principles you would: 1
thought and salazar: 1
general malfoy why: 1
army and less: 1
told that he: 1
looked very lined: 1
she'd known she: 1
was just totally: 1
to come out: 1
had glossed right: 1
of her because: 1
houses said harry: 1
in his office: 1

his head turned: 1
ran around her: 1
only taken a: 1
that not being: 1
bad idea -: 1
point she'd never: 1
ask for help: 1
had been a: 1
wizard nodded slowly: 1
the eyes when: 1
mr potter and: 1
hermione granger and: 1
lost to harry: 1
do not respect: 1
have won miss: 1
to be through: 1
where that shield: 1
remembered as harry: 1
harry's darkness though: 1
had almost gotten: 1
use the art: 1
- what hermione: 1
hopeless they stayed: 1
mouth and press: 1
even though her: 1
her it was: 1
stepped out of: 1
know who could: 1
said hermione she: 1
only used my: 1
defense professor didn't: 1
the way down: 1
cast their futile: 1
no idea at: 1
- harry said: 1
had been invented: 1
lot after she: 1
fair hermione she: 1
she is not: 1
she took a: 1
again she glanced: 1
granger dumbledore rose: 1
find words if: 1
sometimes like he: 1
afraid miss granger: 1
was just to: 1
quirrell had been: 1
can truly do: 1
had praised general: 1
a leader and: 1
your soldiers swarm: 1
me no choice: 1
his quest is: 1
flaming in her: 1
dragon general still: 1
except broomstick riding: 1
the headmaster what: 1
how harry potter: 1
as penetrating his: 1
alternatives a sardonic: 1
and - she'd: 1
as professor mcgonagall: 1
helplessness she didn't: 1
them hermione granger: 1
leads me to: 1
leaned forward and: 1
some time later: 1
chosen your path: 1
to miss granger: 1
malfoy only looked: 1
be right because: 1
a little with: 1
fault or anything: 1
then the endless: 1
own vulnerability or: 1
on hermione's shoulder: 1
help right now: 1
minds when they: 1
britain and how: 1
all how fortunate: 1
anywhere at all: 1
she'd been thinking: 1
a glance at: 1
nearly all folk: 1
whole time and: 1
legionnaires with a: 1
good idea i: 1
of thought and: 1
run away when: 1
really just thought: 1
transfiguration parchment due: 1
general principles you: 1
and this time: 1
fast as she: 1
professor of battle: 1
you fell afterward: 1
potter is special: 1
wouldn't even understand: 1
should've been frightened: 1

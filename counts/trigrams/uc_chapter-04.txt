potter-evans-verres no said: 1
hopefully mcgonagall's gaze: 1
why act part: 1
their way is: 1
i'll want one: 1
fraction the wealth: 1
get use it: 1
than metal making: 1
million british pounds: 1
gazes mcgonagall engaging: 1
didn't think was: 1

would cheaper rule: 1
finer points arbitraging: 1
it would make: 1
gold-to-silver ratio got: 1
some the books: 1
bring if think: 1
pants-leg that makes: 1
and looked like: 1
ten thousand british: 1
ever ran out: 1
week harry filed: 1
top three books: 1
arbitraging away market: 1
or had week: 1
teeth only fool: 1
possible mcgonagall hesitated: 1
than their outsides: 1
a monopoly thereby: 1
suppose i came: 1
mr potter yes: 1
hissed goblin griphook: 1
there were around: 1
metal making them: 1
saying hogwarts can: 1
fifty one harry: 1

stacks gold coins: 1
it's also possible: 1
is a sense: 1
within potter vault: 1
between worlds the: 1
be expecting lay: 1
only fool would: 1
a decent math: 1
tapped against his: 1
pounds even starbucks: 1
potter it's also: 1
one hand dumping: 1
which would constitute: 1
free meanwhile giant: 1
whoever might defeat: 1
some sort snide: 1
could smile remember: 1
j k rowling: 1
any them would: 1
when died is: 1
than enough pay: 1
pounds kilogram so: 1
he'd been tempted: 1
i won't hold: 1
good enough i: 1
blankly griphook grinned: 1
okay bribe people: 1
just no idea: 1
whole body seemed: 1
old textbooks so: 1
questions didn't know: 1
tradition yes exactly: 1
intent well made: 1
rough numbers very: 1
know i am: 1
silent staring contest: 1
one it would: 1
would find ton: 1
about sixty coins: 1
out the bargain: 1
eyes intent well: 1
father was last: 1
awesomeness batman's utility: 1
when instead could: 1
don't remember occasion: 1
sickles galleons take: 1
also possible mcgonagall: 1
are very expensive: 1
some this really: 1
using an insignificant: 1
books i was: 1
known that i'm: 1
gold coins guarded: 1
money or had: 1
grim satisfaction it: 1
terrible harry squeaked: 1
buy few toys: 1
your head twenty: 1
it's okay bribe: 1
seeing one or: 1
seeming lean casually: 1
vault ought suit: 1
i could the: 1
his mind elsewhere: 1
harry squeaked stepped: 1
few toys using: 1
either way i: 1
board fiscal prudence: 1
into other when: 1
i am all: 1
requirements harry stumped: 1
mr potter it's: 1
will only allowed: 1
than gold coins: 1
other things i: 1
stored your money: 1
very quickly your: 1
him seeming lean: 1
other hand one: 1
i ever mow: 1
here cost five: 1
front a giant: 1
tempted make some: 1
not bad harry: 1
locked gazes mcgonagall: 1
so galleon would: 1
remember occasion harry's: 1
much would charge: 1
professor mcgonagall i: 1
bounties had been: 1
i'm picking consistent: 1
two other things: 1
could just carry: 1
defeating most terrible: 1
more than enough: 1
waits eternally the: 1
young face as: 1
items until are: 1
i'm asking if: 1
one harry didn't: 1
i'm doing fermi: 1
very much wish: 1
mcgonagall you should: 1
days frantically hitting: 1
going be getting: 1
discovering amazing new: 1
like i'm saying: 1
can't eat money: 1
fearsome terrible harry: 1
would keep a: 1
a retrieval charm: 1
starbucks would cheaper: 1
impossible maintain exchange: 1
weight griphook's eyes: 1
- mr potter: 1
getting rough numbers: 1
general are made: 1
whole tool set: 1
bad he was: 1
definitely need one: 1
who was waiting: 1
as much sense: 1
full gold coins: 1
yes exactly mcgonagall's: 1
seemed relax slightly: 1
griphook sighed put: 1
these coins pure: 1
away wouldn't it's: 1
every time muggle: 1
own whole wizarding: 1
wrong sir i: 1
am all about: 1
size so forty: 1
doing great service: 1
the galleon that: 1
ton sickles made: 1
galleons general are: 1
reading me all: 1
the wizarding economy: 1
made it for: 1
supposed be worth: 1
me sort possibly: 1
the goblin watched: 1
thousand galleons or: 1
that's - family: 1
as i buy: 1
wonder surely would: 1
so would around: 1
said puzzled perhaps: 1
vault whenever wanted: 1
i am totally: 1
been collected yet: 1
her head your: 1
anyway and looked: 1
locked in vault: 1
i can afford: 1
what you say: 1
more than their: 1
certain grim satisfaction: 1
possibly even outright: 1
contest like what: 1
gold was what: 1
him glittering eyes: 1
said finally what: 1
fermi estimate said: 1
either dimension the: 1
guilty about spending: 1
now my father: 1
he had so: 1
possibly even if: 1
textbooks so i: 1
books right that's: 1
pound harry wheeled: 1
metal would well: 1
a suggested revision: 1
your words though: 1
a giant heap: 1
harry said coins: 1
which quick fermi: 1
glittering eyes for: 1
here and left: 1
i would doing: 1
insignificant fraction the: 1
know rowling said: 1
said was roughly: 1
trunk like mr: 1
supplies mr potter: 1
make deal little: 1
cannot deny logic: 1
using hand-me-down wands: 1
and little spending: 1
holding never mind: 1
i wonder surely: 1
the family vault: 1
emplaced them yes: 1
now any rate: 1
take out coins: 1
push mr potter: 1
like mr potter: 1
weight seventeen sickles: 1
as fraction the: 1
withdraw an additional: 1
words harry said: 1
is watching from: 1
harry said finally: 1
start from just: 1
the larger muggle: 1
give me wild: 1
fundie could probably: 1
sure when i'm: 1
middle discovering amazing: 1
the library i'm: 1
literally stored your: 1
archetypal are these: 1
inefficiencies might well: 1
idea all how: 1
explore amazing new: 1
vault the wizarding: 1
just outside door: 1
i'm sure interesting: 1
- maybe mini: 1
one who emplaced: 1
out coins out: 1
rate so how: 1
metal harry said: 1
feel less guilty: 1
five heaps that: 1
galleons a wand: 1
had been taut: 1
i bring if: 1
one lousy pound: 1
one here has: 1
again harry was: 1
i get ton: 1
books i bring: 1

being rich which: 1
per heap roughly: 1
but i did: 1
one those too: 1
could the top: 1
- i am: 1
implied five british: 1
to waste another: 1
a young couple: 1
shook her head: 1
afford them now: 1
take time out: 1
somewhere or other: 1
used bookstores old: 1
galleon either gold: 1
ratio somewhere around: 1
so some this: 1
dragons where had: 1
face i would: 1
hand-me-down wands thanks: 1
about reasonable i: 1
five thousand pounds: 1
somewhat alarmed it's: 1
then said goblin: 1
which had been: 1
harry locked gazes: 1
sixty coins high: 1
lawn one lousy: 1
them up griphook: 1
all sorry if: 1
i'm accusing of: 1
money like mentioned: 1
bring a ton: 1
part the metal: 1
griphook hissed mcgonagall: 1
i can remember: 1
ratio got more: 1
wouldn't it's same: 1
wouldn't to just: 1
expecting lay your: 1
impulse control but: 1
thereby collects seigniorage: 1
decent out the: 1
take gold the: 1
like what mcgonagall: 1
silver could i: 1
about spending very: 1
griphook so only: 1
math science library: 1
time out explore: 1
i'm sure when: 1
him or those: 1
sickles made it: 1
when i'm an: 1
smile remember your: 1
coffee here cost: 1
entire world if: 1

mr potter hm: 1
sprawling backward into: 1
them around somewhere: 1
just pull one: 1
purchases harry locked: 1
outright admiration and: 1
dumping them into: 1
twentieth part the: 1
never mind swiss: 1
eight thousand galleons: 1
mcgonagall engaging a: 1
money the finer: 1
those too it's: 1
rowling said something: 1
keep some the: 1
say professor mcgonagall: 1
harry filed away: 1
potter vault ought: 1
money griphook sighed: 1
either gold or: 1
anyway that's spirit: 1
purchasing power a: 1
will more than: 1
instead could smile: 1
or other it's: 1
growled there was: 1
fear i cannot: 1
calculation a what: 1
me what no: 1
hold gringotts it: 1
heaps gold galleons: 1
if cup coffee: 1
looked bemused i: 1
all times just: 1
sticking it i: 1
never to waste: 1
gold the muggle: 1
ton silver i: 1
would doing great: 1
decoupled the muggle: 1
apparent purchasing power: 1
mcgonagall said finally: 1
in vault left: 1
around somewhere or: 1
potter perhaps entire: 1
taut seemed relax: 1
world if cup: 1
numbers very quickly: 1
sweeter you okay: 1
galleon as others: 1
muggle gold-to-silver ratio: 1
other when had: 1
it's the best: 1
admiration and little: 1
much mr griphook: 1
face as i: 1
2 million british: 1
vaults full gold: 1
as others noted: 1
swallowed word to: 1
find ton silver: 1
goblin coin in: 1
said finally trunks: 1
right that's -: 1
watching look delight: 1
it was too: 1
face grew stern: 1
value sticking it: 1
well pay the: 1
anyone coin them: 1
science library me: 1
left here and: 1
bribe people books: 1
the coining harry: 1
where start from: 1
others noted i'm: 1
other words harry: 1
bribe me what: 1
extension charm can: 1
meanwhile giant heaps: 1
will allow to: 1
them would make: 1
toys compared that: 1
galleons per heap: 1
i am going: 1
would well pay: 1
don't panic professor: 1
and just what: 1
eternally the void: 1
pounds not bad: 1
trunks whose insides: 1
mcgonagall mr potter: 1
mr potter-evans-verres the: 1
a sense mine: 1
eat money mcgonagall: 1
even outright admiration: 1
noted i'm picking: 1
got more than: 1
still that's last: 1
fifty british pounds: 1
hissed mcgonagall a: 1
than started repeat: 1
you say professor: 1
said for now: 1
lay your hands: 1
disclaimer j k: 1
you mcgonagall growled: 1
an insignificant fraction: 1
crudity their financial: 1
started repeat wasn't: 1
spirit and does: 1
mouth open the: 1
asking if galleons: 1
coins guarded dragons: 1
harry stood there: 1
completely decoupled the: 1
ought suit his: 1
could probably own: 1
the books i: 1
whole wizarding world: 1
pure gold of: 1
to whoever might: 1
made sense being: 1
i think i: 1
respect possibly even: 1
what are few: 1
my superiors give: 1
as much as: 1
mcgonagall why rain: 1
sickles one galleon: 1
gaze frank respect: 1
i very much: 1
coins were actually: 1
forth the one: 1
harry a gaze: 1
i buy few: 1
gold silver so: 1
out anywhere i'll: 1
might have been: 1
until became impossible: 1
would make good: 1
probably own whole: 1
not like i'm: 1
pyramidal so would: 1
gaze didn't waver: 1
then again harry: 1
an adult i'll: 1
usual amount money: 1
reluctantly a mokeskin: 1
old family mr: 1
am totally board: 1
two days frantically: 1
came here a: 1
his face i: 1
world domination is: 1
larger muggle economy: 1
is earned me: 1
vault left here: 1
make reasonable withdrawals: 1
her face so: 1
worth about fifty: 1
sir i just: 1
spending money like: 1
their financial system: 1
mcgonagall said sounding: 1
was archetypal are: 1
school supplies mr: 1
said coins aren't: 1
was too bad: 1
fool would trust: 1
square seven galleons: 1
jingling noise sprawling: 1
change sickles pay: 1
muggle economy no: 1
silver i wonder: 1
a kilogram maybe: 1
surely would be: 1
gold coins a: 1
tiny fraction it: 1
panic professor mcgonagall: 1
reasonable i am: 1
what ten thousand: 1
test character so: 1
okay just let: 1
and left without: 1
can hold number: 1
i wouldn't to: 1
couldn't take time: 1
pull one out: 1
enough pay your: 1
harry was standing: 1
the top three: 1
might want store: 1
additional hundred galleons: 1
have their vault: 1
less interesting still: 1
one or two: 1
potter you think: 1
professor mcgonagall it's: 1
reasonable withdrawals -: 1
be worth any: 1
sorry if came: 1
seigniorage what said: 1
the vault mcgonagall: 1
i know i: 1
was standing a: 1
happy day when: 1
make some sort: 1
system works i'm: 1
world optimization heaps: 1
i just no: 1
harry smiled a: 1
charm can hold: 1
did see some: 1
actually smaller than: 1
fraction the whole: 1
i cannot deny: 1
reached twenty mcgonagall: 1
see some things: 1
family mr potter: 1
coins out your: 1
that's spirit and: 1
or 2 million: 1
interesting harry said: 1
sense buy now: 1
system but sad: 1
wheeled the giant: 1
three books i: 1
is happy day: 1
wide either dimension: 1
pouch' what i: 1
didn't waver and: 1
it right away: 1
waiting near door: 1
little sweeter you: 1
i was reading: 1
placed you-know-who payable: 1
i are going: 1
assemble something decent: 1
sickles piles bronze: 1
sense mine that: 1
might well lost: 1
enough i wouldn't: 1
philosopher's stone harry: 1
it a twentieth: 1
possible causes fine: 1
thousand pounds even: 1
mr potter -: 1
philosopher's stone griphook: 1
the base was: 1
amount money a: 1
i know rowling: 1
fraction it don't: 1
out explore amazing: 1
act part the: 1
trailed off hopefully: 1
heaps that size: 1
as such will: 1
bronze knuts harry: 1
harry mcgonagall looked: 1
mr potter i: 1
word to whoever: 1
suit his near-term: 1
things existed and: 1
one galleon either: 1
pure metal harry: 1
expensive mr potter: 1
a way getting: 1
library me hogwarts: 1
one and i: 1
batman's utility belt: 1
that i'm accusing: 1
little spending money: 1
make good additions: 1
piles bronze knuts: 1
harry said his: 1
yet i'm sure: 1
mcgonagall's face grew: 1
your financial system: 1
sharp teeth only: 1
very sharp teeth: 1
phrase i prefer: 1
fee where would: 1
those bounties might: 1
mcgonagall growled there: 1
mean i would: 1
it for fee: 1
things the way: 1
twenty coins wide: 1
world being rich: 1
the muggle world: 1
the metal would: 1
things wizarding the: 1
knuts harry stood: 1
ugly phrase i: 1
pure was archetypal: 1
some things the: 1
collects seigniorage what: 1
add another ten: 1
weighed tenth a: 1
insides hold more: 1
against his pants-leg: 1
is their way: 1
all about reasonable: 1
slightly i was: 1
superiors give me: 1
away notion case: 1
if galleons general: 1
regret i am: 1
stood there stared: 1
hogwarts can keep: 1
being ungrateful or: 1
spend next two: 1
engaging a silent: 1
case ever ran: 1
their vault the: 1
a wand children: 1
lean casually against: 1
this really is: 1
instead later get: 1
adult i'll want: 1
think was seventeen: 1
that doesn't square: 1
door the vault: 1
trading range gold: 1
i did see: 1
or two other: 1
know where start: 1
money may from: 1
anything still what: 1
making them up: 1
like silver coins: 1
good one lots: 1
said slowly so: 1
it can't as: 1
squeaked stepped back: 1
snide remark about: 1
well made sense: 1
near-term requirements harry: 1
a philosopher's stone: 1
but oh professor: 1
points arbitraging away: 1
harry didn't think: 1
than 5 away: 1
only is wizarding: 1
coins pure metal: 1
pile gold coins: 1
heap money griphook: 1
have spend next: 1
elsewhere hold i'm: 1
standing a bank: 1
the void between: 1
of course sighed: 1
think will more: 1
giant heap gold: 1
better yet i'll: 1
amp f collection: 1
watched him glittering: 1
or anything still: 1
can keep some: 1
be about sixty: 1
hypothetically harry said: 1
the giant heap: 1
your father was: 1
somewhere around fifty: 1
yes i definitely: 1
wizarding the first: 1
seventeen sickles one: 1
sure interesting harry: 1
the apparent purchasing: 1
said sounding somewhat: 1
heaps gold coins: 1
deal little sweeter: 1
british pounds kilogram: 1
your money vaults: 1
math thing named: 1
a trunk like: 1
waver and just: 1
any rate so: 1
maintain exchange rate: 1
course said griphook: 1
arbitrage the larger: 1
grownup when instead: 1
from just outside: 1
twenty mcgonagall coughed: 1
things i might: 1
i would to: 1
way i mean: 1
hedge fundie could: 1
childhood watching look: 1
put palm over: 1
hold more than: 1
so many questions: 1
after enrico fermi: 1
bemused i mean: 1
mini sf amp: 1
afford one it: 1
silver should drained: 1
was reading me: 1
sounding somewhat alarmed: 1
without any more: 1
deny logic your: 1
too bad he: 1
my parents were: 1
i discover all: 1
the middle discovering: 1
when i discover: 1
one later harry: 1
the finer points: 1
off hopefully mcgonagall's: 1
consult my superiors: 1
filed away notion: 1
whenever wanted spend: 1
at all sorry: 1
when had reached: 1
should told me: 1
was favoring harry: 1
worlds the novels: 1
items or books: 1
stone griphook hissed: 1
me buy -: 1
ten galleons griphook: 1
said reluctantly a: 1
want good one: 1
i just want: 1
had week free: 1
roughly billion times: 1
world magic couldn't: 1
look her face: 1
really is a: 1
beltpack ultimate awesomeness: 1
be getting them: 1
coin them or: 1
looked like silver: 1
parade surely is: 1
finally what hissed: 1
griphook who was: 1
over whole pile: 1
ever known that: 1
whole weight griphook's: 1
watched him seeming: 1
so every time: 1
said griphook and: 1
seven galleons a: 1
i'm an adult: 1
galleon that doesn't: 1
gold silver ratio: 1
alarmed it's math: 1
heard arbitrage the: 1
can assemble something: 1
library i'm going: 1
think does it: 1
- harry pleaded: 1
mr potter but: 1
gold coins was: 1
about fifty british: 1
maybe mini sf: 1
the wealth i: 1
i understand my: 1
mcgonagall's gaze didn't: 1
enrico fermi a: 1
5 change sickles: 1
novels seem inconsistent: 1
bookstores old textbooks: 1
grumpy grownup when: 1
you okay just: 1
i can assemble: 1
mcgonagall coughed i: 1
allowed make reasonable: 1
earned me sort: 1
so only is: 1
seemed slump i: 1
grown-up purchases harry: 1
wanted spend money: 1
speaking hypothetically harry: 1
- family tradition: 1
harry said for: 1
causes fine you: 1
galleons stacks silver: 1
an ugly phrase: 1
a bank literally: 1
earlier i think: 1
where waits eternally: 1
potter you are: 1
utility belt holding: 1
- books of: 1
think any them: 1
young couple have: 1
books i could: 1
mcgonagall i understand: 1
quick fermi estimate: 1
rain my parade: 1
said his mind: 1
my young face: 1
money either way: 1
fee mr potter-evans-verres: 1
out wrong sir: 1
i mean suppose: 1
the weight seventeen: 1
within week harry: 1
fluctuating trading range: 1
the cube eight: 1

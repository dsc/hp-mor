dean in a: 1
finding exactly the: 1
compulsion was killing: 1
insolence was to: 1
moved breaking gaze: 1
chewed with a: 1
react are you: 1
single response stored: 1
in another flash: 1
piercing - words: 1
fully the thought: 1
and vanished another: 1
does the headmaster: 1

professor flitwick's voice: 1
any closer than: 1
berserk he'd kill: 1
for her hermione: 1
harry sees that: 1
of shock that: 1
chocolate floated into: 1
then being exposed: 1
yourself so as: 1

they were probably: 1
it seemed between: 1
minerva tell her: 1
voice of professor: 1
quizzically and it: 1
which there was: 1
that seriously it: 1
if that person: 1
vanished another piece: 1

a chance there: 1
chocolate albus dumbledore: 1
wasn't meant for: 1
of those two: 1
mean it does: 1
the headmaster's voice: 1
that belonged to: 1
halted all movements: 1
that will work: 1
strange something that: 1
you ready good: 1
of red-gold shuffled: 1
elsewhere and when: 1
is lost what: 1
evil person inside: 1
looking around with: 1
shut up before: 1
dark side harry: 1
shock that crossed: 1
all to kill: 1
new evil person: 1

since none of: 1
about his dark: 1
where the headmaster: 1
when albus dumbledore: 1
were useful killing: 1
is beyond even: 1
will be able: 1

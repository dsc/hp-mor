through the corridors: 2
but she was: 2

high reaches of: 2
a muggle artifact: 2
and she saw: 2
down a peg: 2
the chaos legion: 2
she saw that: 2
the sleep hex: 2
a moment later: 2
ran into someone: 2
said somnium and: 2
harry's voice from: 2
make sure that: 2
harry's voice i: 2
that had been: 2
her but she: 2
and the other: 2
managed to say: 2
of the noble: 2
a few seconds: 2
of dragon army: 2
with captain goldstein: 2
that was the: 2
most ancient blade: 2
and not to: 2
a lot of: 2
to make sure: 2
of her mind: 2
raised her left: 2
by a dozen: 2
the spell was: 2
held in either: 2

and theodore was: 2
the corner of: 2
harry and neville: 2
house of greengrass: 2
there was the: 2
he held in: 2
compasses he held: 2
of the way: 2
the high reaches: 2
all she could: 2
and as she: 2
in either hand: 2
in the high: 2
the air and: 2
of the sunshine: 2
out of her: 2
voice from beneath: 2
you had to: 2
cried somnium and: 2
she couldn't see: 2
but draco was: 2
rooms and corridors: 2
had been a: 2
at each other: 2
even while people: 1
both armies in: 1
parvati patil and: 1
they might figure: 1
contego shields sprung: 1
a tantrum that: 1
his face her: 1
might have searched: 1
spell was too: 1
understand and she: 1
said anthony yeah: 1
from the ground: 1
there was nowhere: 1
stupidity is doing: 1
forms had gone: 1
they were just: 1
- that was: 1
cloth stretched over: 1
hogwarts statues so: 1
time and check: 1
they were both: 1
wands out and: 1
gryffindor boy laughed: 1
about the boy-who-lived: 1
case neville hadn't: 1
up to point: 1
yet - that: 1
back hit the: 1
iridescent compasses he: 1
where sunshine would: 1
the thud of: 1
wouldn't change even: 1
wand on her: 1
the tip of: 1
but - stupidity: 1
architectural style or: 1
to the noble: 1
were a muggleborn: 1
like the sort: 1
prismatic shield while: 1
in audible gasps: 1
you had us: 1
a compass that: 1
dueling-grade stunner blasted: 1
general chaos you: 1
ravum calvaria and: 1
touches you know: 1
- her lady: 1
good idea in: 1
of greengrass daphne's: 1
a lot less: 1
that if he: 1
the last word: 1
boys went in: 1
the right way: 1
recognized as a: 1
falling in slow: 1
potter had changed: 1
was practically conceding: 1
too angry and: 1
scion of longbottom: 1
soon and hit: 1
that his place: 1
this weighs more: 1
nope harry said: 1
either hand one: 1
her arm as: 1
moments later neville's: 1
when dragon army: 1
battles once more: 1
interesting lately as: 1
not really your: 1
your own spell: 1
compasses they might: 1
it and then: 1
of fighting in: 1
yes i do: 1
settle for merely: 1
slytherin boy gave: 1
were striding through: 1
of strength out: 1
all it seemed: 1
you're - like: 1
his side that: 1
clearly as he: 1
to resent this: 1
but he was: 1
her wand came: 1
harry watching the: 1
and this time: 1
stupefy the dueling-grade: 1
than her so: 1
on harry nodded: 1
dueling sword looked: 1
prismatic sphere the: 1
to go when: 1
no it's the: 1
position of wealth: 1
them separately the: 1
given all she: 1
about what would: 1
ernie we getting: 1
hermione granger i: 1
could but hermione: 1
general potter she: 1
that she couldn't: 1
that would happen: 1
invincible the two: 1
attacking malfoy now: 1
like the better: 1
at him they: 1
way to take: 1
myself then she: 1
last stunning hex: 1
wasn't bothering to: 1
crazy he had: 1
neville's voice we're: 1
light went past: 1
wonder if i: 1
trying to maneuver: 1
be the last: 1
about the obvious: 1
said somnium but: 1
were currently maintaining: 1
be your opponents: 1
if i can: 1
blew straight out: 1
angry and confused: 1
rose she saw: 1
she could before: 1
you said hermione: 1
draco had a: 1
sleep hex it: 1
they started whacking: 1
in red light: 1
days and never: 1
made way for: 1
rumors about what: 1
chaos from us: 1
direct intercept course: 1
they couldn't use: 1
reach of hogwarts: 1
how she wanted: 1
understood things like: 1
out what theory: 1
another lord was: 1
then a few: 1
meant to help: 1
effort new contego: 1
as theodore laughed: 1
what seemed like: 1
harry's voice high: 1
practiced at all: 1
to fight with: 1
neville's voice we'll: 1
them extra credit: 1
the boy shouted: 1
malfoy tradition which: 1
and so there: 1
maintained their influence: 1
you interesting theory: 1
close i didn't: 1
be pointing their: 1
lecturing her soldiers: 1
lucis gladius for: 1
compass that pointed: 1
lot of strength: 1
we'll beat you: 1
where he'd been: 1
she imagined touching: 1
difficult feat even: 1
was suddenly a: 1
at harry there: 1
evilly as his: 1
she believed and: 1
striding through a: 1
the prismatic shield: 1
she couldn't afford: 1
gladius the huge: 1
as the too-powerful: 1
of people but: 1
know the defense: 1
up and managed: 1
demure demeanors and: 1
it and not: 1
kind of god: 1
it wasn't really: 1
barely managed to: 1
not try to: 1
that kind of: 1
daphne's wand swung: 1
the most ancient: 1
enveloped in grey: 1
already lost too: 1
padma's voice and: 1
lot better with: 1
professor had said: 1
long that everyone: 1
moving slowly and: 1
- draco managed: 1
was as harry: 1
being his foremost: 1
he was hitting: 1
flying that had: 1
if you listened: 1
hearing people talk: 1
of thoughts that: 1
style or apparent: 1
in the book: 1
see his face: 1
still visibly sweaty: 1
promote me back: 1
word that hermione: 1
impressive by comparison: 1
a little numbness: 1
too weak -: 1
of the upper: 1
wand made a: 1
in her army: 1
girl had given: 1
like he was: 1
us said blaise: 1
would have been: 1
dragon army so: 1
fist it was: 1
yellow-golden compass that: 1
boys in their: 1
the corridor flew: 1
while people looked: 1
both hands and: 1
the occasional wizard-knight: 1
smashed right through: 1
battle and a: 1
in advance you: 1
the largest one: 1
shrieked the voice: 1
parted and the: 1
with the enemy: 1
looked directly at: 1
look on his: 1
prismatic sphere protecting: 1
in grey cloaks: 1
flight stopped and: 1
take them on: 1
began to shuffle: 1
mix directly in: 1
peg general chaos: 1
said hermione a: 1
was all she: 1
herself to her: 1
professor quirrell known: 1
extra muscle said: 1
a dozen generations: 1
away good ideas: 1
a bit thumpy: 1
the incandescent sword: 1
only grinned as: 1
somehow it couldn't: 1
was a good: 1
sunshine regiment and: 1
a different result: 1
through daphne's mind: 1
what you got: 1
belonged to the: 1
shape had fully: 1
had thoroughly explained: 1
and the balance: 1
soldiers or potter: 1
reflections like fire: 1
bother working out: 1
they were all: 1
they'd gone but: 1
centuries of experience: 1
seen enough plays: 1
what harry and: 1
territorial hazard of: 1
and neville walked: 1
that you couldn't: 1
corridors to signal: 1
y-intersection an annoying: 1
face of the: 1
said harry yes: 1
and knees but: 1
people talk about: 1
in case they: 1
leaped forward to: 1
for this so: 1
of the hover: 1
obviously stronger than: 1
here's super hermione: 1
using weak spells: 1
that's weird captain: 1
surprisingly loud and: 1
cool and something: 1
thinks he can: 1
as harry's voice: 1
goldstein who understood: 1
very impressive by: 1
was still in: 1
theodore's face instead: 1
stunning hex and: 1
- hermione stopped: 1
who looked like: 1
army would be: 1
so there was: 1
theodore was rushing: 1
the faces beneath: 1
maneuver out from: 1
had been getting: 1
corridors all over: 1
traitors if you: 1
of anthony and: 1
say somnium and: 1
jumble of thoughts: 1
anthony's voice followed: 1
boy and a: 1
and yet still: 1
hand into the: 1
of the lord: 1
hex - doesn't: 1
was appropriate for: 1
tactic for the: 1
she wanted to: 1
feel as the: 1
had a multicolored: 1
of so many: 1
running it would: 1
getting tired of: 1
of a prismatic: 1
soldiers were striding: 1
were getting close: 1
i do some: 1
effort screamed the: 1
tantrum that could: 1
circle and she: 1
sunday the first: 1
of his eye: 1
inside her and: 1
woke up inside: 1
watching the yellow-golden: 1
the sun the: 1
still get you: 1
like the sleep: 1
and parvati even: 1
though she'd had: 1
chaos legion harry: 1
constant observation the: 1
sphere protecting the: 1
her mother had: 1
was a beater's: 1
gotten this lecture: 1
eye where gregory: 1
boy laughed evilly: 1
her and said: 1
soldiers it would: 1
soon be fought: 1
harry said equably: 1
jenny rustad were: 1
compasses and try: 1
all jogged to: 1
use somnium on: 1
know they all: 1
screamed stupefy the: 1
fire they'd only: 1
recharging his own: 1
up with us: 1
separately the slytherin: 1
through the contego: 1
castle began to: 1
the sound of: 1
think in words: 1
nodded and then: 1
padma was still: 1
but they wouldn't: 1
up on the: 1
had said the: 1
they ran into: 1
to all do: 1
dragon and sunshine: 1
to her feet: 1
her cast by: 1
charm of the: 1
what theory he: 1
at the huge: 1
could if the: 1
turn seemed to: 1
eight centuries hogwarts: 1
busy frantically dodging: 1
guess where they'd: 1
all by themselves: 1
having practiced among: 1
was the sound: 1
and harry and: 1
on malfoy prismatis: 1
a muggleborn and: 1
check every closet: 1
his soldiers it: 1
had to settle: 1
red light dulak: 1
why as he: 1
designated to hold: 1
happen when dragon: 1
barely dodged there: 1
the upper levels: 1
toward her she: 1
grey hood rather: 1
fact right now: 1
a tingle on: 1
thinks we're allied: 1
to say somnium: 1
as theodore said: 1
the stunbolt had: 1
talking and looked: 1
be to mix: 1
own spell back: 1
to point at: 1
she was breathing: 1
pointed his wand: 1
the slytherin boy: 1
confront neville with: 1
to put on: 1
her she was: 1
spell right on: 1
too once hermione: 1
beneath his hood: 1
stupidly proud and: 1
the upper reaches: 1
without saying i: 1
was rushing toward: 1
gladius for a: 1
trudged on through: 1
toward the ground: 1
into positions where: 1
no hermione said: 1
it'll only stun: 1
one he'd ever: 1
and theodore's wand: 1
her crush and: 1
at a leisurely: 1
in four hours: 1
know whether they'll: 1
time by dint: 1
seconds to recharge: 1
from us first: 1
of the castle: 1
couldn't delay the: 1
ancient houses to: 1
corridors harry watching: 1
this lecture from: 1
if the sleep: 1
could build up: 1
had given up: 1
a circle and: 1
still had to: 1
up - -: 1
to cast anyway: 1
fell in an: 1
iridescent sheen to: 1
would be pointing: 1
on her i: 1
neville keeping a: 1
frantically pushed herself: 1
generation's power structure: 1
her and when: 1
granger i understand: 1
sometimes another lord: 1
troops would already: 1
harry and she: 1
the huge black-wooden: 1
direction started to: 1
began making small: 1
tonare the wand: 1
harry potter had: 1
and shrieked lucis: 1
mouth we still: 1
cried greengrass of: 1
where the territory: 1
for too long: 1
case they ran: 1
as she realized: 1
would be recharging: 1
as harry spoke: 1
sad how people: 1
something same here: 1
had lasted longer: 1
you're not invincible: 1
long wide corridor: 1
try she couldn't: 1
the two boys: 1
neville's voice calmly: 1
pushed forward and: 1
move until almost: 1
dragged down with: 1
themselves and the: 1
draco with his: 1
into someone who: 1
you know that: 1
ground anew each: 1
all over again: 1
other and get: 1
head and she: 1
he looked up: 1
after a while: 1
when the huge: 1
and so father: 1
they actually hit: 1
no way they: 1
you couldn't see: 1
gregory and vincent: 1
eyes on the: 1
who would be: 1
a dozen sleep: 1
recharge somnium curse: 1
led to sunshine: 1
would hold a: 1
fray into dreams: 1
wished that daphne: 1
face instead of: 1
as four chaotic: 1
into noticing that: 1
faces of anthony: 1
but it was: 1
still she had: 1
father and leveled: 1
four hours practice: 1
like you're -: 1
believe she'd managed: 1
of hogwarts a: 1
most ancient houses: 1
a high ringing: 1
you lot are: 1
it's sad how: 1
violating the agreement: 1
me now except: 1
spell had sent: 1
as possible -: 1
go as they: 1
casting that fifth: 1
should have leaped: 1
after having practiced: 1
chest theodore dodged: 1
harry's grey hood: 1
of the game: 1
later draco shouted: 1
for a few: 1
which in turn: 1
the other two: 1
that they cast: 1
crashed into a: 1
wasn't even trying: 1
lightsabers at all: 1
tradition which centuries: 1
she could do: 1
cast it so: 1
been in one: 1
pretty interesting lately: 1
her eye susan: 1
longbottom that everyone: 1
they were getting: 1
and check every: 1
barrier we'll beat: 1
up all the: 1
soldiers in her: 1
march professor quirrell: 1
dulak and it: 1
neville's voice from: 1
each other straight: 1
just - luminos: 1
much as she: 1
the face of: 1
apparent solidity -: 1
remember death challenges: 1
way they all: 1
hermione still wished: 1
first targets of: 1
it so it'll: 1
laughed evilly he: 1
she raised her: 1
she was so: 1
each other they: 1
still wished that: 1
help the other: 1
stunbolt had gotten: 1
slow motion toward: 1
call that arrogant: 1
spoke up suddenly: 1
house of longbottom: 1
of those figures: 1
on the faces: 1
is watching but: 1
beside her and: 1
bothering to dodge: 1
this was crazy: 1
a dozen voices: 1
figures already raising: 1
could defeat invincible: 1
fire pointing always: 1
else their footsteps: 1
potter herself she'd: 1
apparently had never: 1
whacking at each: 1
and talked with: 1
he aimed for: 1
many students would: 1
air and the: 1
weak spells like: 1
equably his feet: 1
fought the presence: 1
air toward harry: 1
lightsabers of course: 1
lieutenant you could: 1
all their forces: 1
her left fist: 1
right way to: 1
pushed herself to: 1
it touches you: 1
inside of hallways: 1
was when the: 1
her soldiers they'd: 1
had a military: 1
daphne hit your: 1
potential position but: 1
things like troop: 1
extra credit for: 1
can just use: 1
almost too late: 1
the dragons started: 1
point at harry: 1
but despite that: 1
their breath but: 1
on through the: 1
nodded keeping his: 1
completely enveloped in: 1
fast as possible: 1
stuff when we: 1
a territorial hazard: 1
to cast the: 1
if he attacks: 1
noisy they might: 1
idea the magical: 1
was testing or: 1
way said neville's: 1
sure that dragon: 1
the better of: 1
from the corner: 1
own lips parted: 1
the chaotic lieutenant: 1
they hadn't practiced: 1
to help the: 1
the ground and: 1
draco could see: 1
right through the: 1
gave a condescending: 1
of soldiers or: 1
could sabotage his: 1
actually used it: 1
had gone completely: 1
practice but she: 1
toward draco with: 1
are hopeless without: 1
aid against general: 1
somnium on you: 1
taking a lot: 1
parvati even as: 1
right on the: 1
of hogwarts draco: 1
sounded like he: 1
without me you: 1
past her and: 1
somnium bellowed anthony's: 1
she saw the: 1
her wand in: 1
he was too: 1
about her ears: 1
be fought the: 1
her twenty-three sunshine: 1
draco could guess: 1
better not try: 1
rehearsing the diamond: 1
she knew it: 1
aimed for theodore's: 1
notice how awesome: 1
fast enough and: 1
energy you know: 1
they got on: 1
believed and yet: 1
books though she'd: 1
battle she and: 1
build up quite: 1
she saw similar: 1
gone but two: 1
point to her: 1
we're invincible the: 1
there sunshine said: 1
said neville and: 1
out and pointed: 1
and power over: 1
house be dragged: 1
on the compass: 1
as nearby a: 1
learning to do: 1
ron not yet: 1
god or something: 1
for secret corridors: 1
confused and not: 1
neville and daphne: 1
late as the: 1
you down a: 1
the look on: 1
theodore wasn't bothering: 1
nowhere to go: 1
the stunbolt back: 1
witch but not: 1
seven on malfoy: 1
keep this up: 1
their tactic for: 1
was still a: 1
part of her: 1
but he looked: 1
centuries by understanding: 1
sustaining the prismatic: 1
of greengrass she: 1
the red light: 1
have felt a: 1
dragon general draco: 1
boy-who-lived like you're: 1
captain goldstein who: 1
shampoo blew straight: 1
would be to: 1
still in denial: 1
and yelled let's: 1
on when she: 1
chaos legion following: 1
off and talked: 1
grey knights of: 1
sounded a bit: 1
visibly sweaty from: 1
again so theodore: 1
the evil laughter: 1
as well as: 1
had enough strength: 1
but a couple: 1
live wire would: 1
couldn't use the: 1
were doing i: 1
like you're some: 1
it but theodore: 1
sunshine if the: 1
better with hermione: 1
his hood we're: 1
and looked at: 1
once more and: 1
just wasn't enough: 1
courtship to go: 1
ground hello there: 1
knew even as: 1
that time as: 1
own compasses only: 1
not to know: 1
of longbottom ravum: 1
watched two compasses: 1
evilly he did: 1
of wealth and: 1
this and not: 1
hermione guessed that: 1
face her wand: 1
or stained glass: 1
saying i hight: 1
her soldiers and: 1
curse you he: 1
hogwarts was still: 1
course harry said: 1
little less still: 1
granger got here: 1
being fashionable for: 1
say anything in: 1
of malfoy had: 1
looked at harry: 1
i'm getting tired: 1
foremost lieutenant you: 1
into position the: 1
be careful each: 1
laughed and shot: 1
of order said: 1
fifth spell had: 1
bellowed anthony's voice: 1
feet were abruptly: 1
someone else their: 1
chaos it wasn't: 1
try to figure: 1
her so draco: 1
calvaria and finally: 1
- like you're: 1
was already scrambling: 1
a position of: 1
given up on: 1
against traitors you: 1
just had to: 1
voice and there: 1
he's attacking malfoy: 1
only legal for: 1
a very very: 1
peg you and: 1
and she spoke: 1
theodore dodged he: 1
beat both armies: 1
lower than second: 1
frowns on the: 1
movies but you: 1
but now it: 1
hadn't actually used: 1
the other boy's: 1
checked that in: 1
draco managed to: 1
hands and knees: 1
her to her: 1
instructions right her: 1
need taking down: 1
hit - no: 1
tired of hearing: 1
perfectly formed harry: 1
about changing in: 1
ambush their tactic: 1
could never quite: 1
interesting theory said: 1
they'd all jogged: 1
with this for: 1
and neville were: 1
other straight out: 1
mr potter i'm: 1
four spells in: 1
one he really: 1
of any ambush: 1
possible - after: 1
opponents for this: 1
even as she: 1
moving in the: 1
she'd seen enough: 1
a circle rehearsing: 1
front of the: 1
were all catching: 1
theodore said somnium: 1
the larger threat: 1
she and her: 1
she bore it: 1
about demure demeanors: 1
said ron not: 1
their forces fighting: 1
the last scion: 1
ground with a: 1
had fully formed: 1
wear it even: 1
incandescent sword toward: 1
but she bore: 1
by jenny and: 1
that everyone was: 1
seconds no one: 1
twisted out of: 1
in turn seemed: 1
mother had ever: 1
suggestion tried giving: 1
she had a: 1
downright cool and: 1
that was orange-red: 1
over a dozen: 1
that in point: 1
so she just: 1
about the stunning: 1
the other girl: 1
the red bolt: 1
of hermione's own: 1
gone completely out: 1
hard still visibly: 1
compasses only hermione: 1
the whole sunshine: 1
as they followed: 1
through what she: 1
so some wizards: 1
hermione granger standing: 1
through her when: 1
do their best: 1
desperately twisted out: 1
of constant observation: 1
knew he was: 1
chaos is moving: 1
straight out of: 1
being affected by: 1
and later on: 1

of another of: 1
revealing two figures: 1
quick silencing charm: 1
forward to confront: 1
spells like the: 1
high and strained: 1
seen her cast: 1
enemy soldiers as: 1
military realism you: 1
idea in case: 1
looked at the: 1
signal the start: 1
voice i know: 1
or something same: 1
the scion of: 1
talking noises coming: 1
while that's why: 1
power structure wasn't: 1
general draco malfoy: 1
kept rehearsing the: 1
thing and expecting: 1
watched certain movies: 1
and said somnium: 1
the balance is: 1
starting to think: 1
- after having: 1
a lot better: 1
like fire pointing: 1
keeping a lookout: 1
faces stood facing: 1
fact that harry: 1
- i think: 1
harry said leveling: 1
and theodore's back: 1
arms outstretched to: 1
she could but: 1
chaos would use: 1
she thought her: 1
and robes grey: 1
neville longbottom that: 1
hogwarts where rooms: 1
giving away good: 1
fighting first-year students: 1
recovered enough to: 1
the heir of: 1

into existence in: 1

only gotten in: 1
longer lagann said: 1
to sunshine if: 1
to her knees: 1
lit by windows: 1
this time he: 1
other had a: 1
but she slashed: 1
each other before: 1
at neville rather: 1
and a girl: 1
greengrass she cried: 1
legionnaires started laughing: 1
pointing their wands: 1
twenty-three sunshine soldiers: 1
frantically dodging as: 1
very very near: 1
metal shirts you've: 1
think the lieutenants: 1
corridor of the: 1
their best to: 1
many soldiers finnigan: 1
wire would feel: 1
potter she wanted: 1
spells it might: 1
hover charms straining: 1
her into noticing: 1
like troop morale: 1
saw that this: 1
a slight pause: 1
she scrambled up: 1
behind her as: 1
around her but: 1
she couldn't remember: 1
he was smiling: 1
i can remember: 1
as his father: 1
they wouldn't change: 1
again but -: 1
whole sunshine regiment: 1
few seconds to: 1
it seemed like: 1
voice screamed stupefy: 1
uncertain and not: 1
got nevvy once: 1
to their front: 1
we're allied so: 1
it would be: 1
you can see: 1
potter i'm taking: 1
harry yes i: 1
with the effort: 1
crying somnium hermione: 1
the ground well: 1
he can beat: 1
and the boy: 1
his eyes on: 1
of mixed-in fighting: 1
pointed toward the: 1
how much she'd: 1
at the fiery: 1
but stare at: 1
wall shattering hannah's: 1
had a bad: 1
black-wooden doors at: 1
on a few: 1
directly at them: 1
at you hermione: 1
it's only legal: 1
harry potter's hand: 1
other which was: 1
at all it: 1
corridor flew open: 1
appropriate for this: 1
and something woke: 1
all that weight: 1
isn't a lot: 1
ancient blade it's: 1
between themselves and: 1
an undignified heap: 1
but am i: 1
two compasses he: 1
were huge and: 1
now and then: 1
group who would: 1
closely so the: 1
the largest active: 1
her about demure: 1
hazard of fighting: 1
and you'd watched: 1
a few moments: 1
sunshine potter thinks: 1
hours practice but: 1
aside and made: 1
sun the other: 1
a battle would: 1
than second granger: 1
shot rapidly through: 1
could've missed stupefy: 1
of the corner: 1
termed it good: 1
it went out: 1
the drain was: 1
now it just: 1
their faces stood: 1
soldiers in tow: 1
threat of chaos: 1
rushing toward draco: 1
just standing there: 1
of longbottom was: 1
regiment and neville: 1
test them but: 1
didn't count as: 1
start to move: 1
and so had: 1
and her officers: 1
sword toward the: 1
by the way: 1
tonare shouted neville: 1
you were a: 1
said ernie we: 1
army who can: 1
was too angry: 1
the grey cloaks: 1
mind she'd seen: 1
the grey knights: 1
she recognized as: 1
this up theodore: 1
father had thoroughly: 1
she was staring: 1
vision was swimming: 1
had to give: 1
word stupefy the: 1
the huge prismatic: 1
the dragons and: 1
color of the: 1
couldn't be a: 1
and crashed into: 1
couldn't figure out: 1
hovered her off: 1
chaos you could: 1
enough strength now: 1
harry who just: 1
this she could: 1
began to fray: 1
silencing charm on: 1
the stone-floored corridor: 1
out what it: 1
voice sounded like: 1
they'd only gotten: 1
draco was to: 1
was getting winded: 1
draco was getting: 1
cast by jenny: 1
rest of the: 1
hard it should: 1
to learn the: 1
each other and: 1
the castle began: 1
yet still no: 1
his place in: 1
breathing hard still: 1
stability of the: 1
influence over britain: 1
but not an: 1
by windows of: 1
a few spells: 1
and daphne as: 1
defense professor is: 1
he just -: 1
dodging as theodore: 1
shattering hannah's voice: 1
slytherin had begun: 1
lot are hopeless: 1
whacked at each: 1
the chest theodore: 1
imagined touching a: 1
out from in: 1
magic she could: 1
used to wear: 1
he ran into: 1
could see from: 1
other army slaughters: 1
coming from zabini's: 1
ancient blade at: 1
managed to twist: 1
and even the: 1
was too busy: 1
soldiers they'd persisted: 1
suddenly frowning at: 1
hex at him: 1
sunday it was: 1
were missing and: 1
levels of hogwarts: 1
army so harry: 1
leap aside just: 1
still trying to: 1
while chaos's other: 1
was crazy he: 1
the voice of: 1
rapidly through the: 1
instructed her on: 1
but there was: 1
were just being: 1
game changed drastically: 1
went in fact: 1
general who looked: 1
ever seen her: 1
anyone in your: 1
strength now to: 1
corridors of hogwarts: 1
that spell oh: 1
diamond within the: 1
afterward draco could: 1
then after only: 1
remembering this she: 1
breath but they: 1
so it'll only: 1
doing the same: 1
hermione why yes: 1
said absently this: 1
- doesn't work: 1
down with the: 1
all ignored the: 1
sigh from beside: 1
don't you said: 1
still being affected: 1
managed to do: 1
as they started: 1
draco felt a: 1
her voice screamed: 1
into the air: 1
understand that it's: 1
theodore's wand went: 1
had to cast: 1
describe the jumble: 1
their influence over: 1
doing this part: 1
and metallic-sounding crash: 1
came up to: 1
where the stability: 1
neither corridor bent: 1
themselves how to: 1
scented shampoo blew: 1
sunshine said harry's: 1
visualization and so: 1
duelist's dance unfortunately: 1
where enemy soldiers: 1
at her went: 1
regiment by myself: 1
it looks like: 1
was no way: 1
the two options: 1
up on lecturing: 1
another harry potter: 1
somnium shrieked draco: 1
the contego shield: 1
searched for days: 1
delay the whole: 1
someone who was: 1
see the look: 1
one last stunning: 1
if chaos and: 1
boy wasn't even: 1
shrieked lucis gladius: 1
knights of chaos: 1
strength for one: 1
itself was uncertain: 1
the other chaotic: 1
seeming downright cool: 1
deny it and: 1
potter's hand would: 1
fight with this: 1
did you're not: 1
him soon afterward: 1
too long all: 1
but i'm getting: 1
haloed in red: 1
certain movies but: 1
the last person: 1
two generals draco: 1
secretly met with: 1
thinking of hypotheses: 1
to let your: 1
was orange-red and: 1
of light like: 1
then the face: 1
hand would hold: 1
i can just: 1
two soldiers couldn't: 1
at anthony's suggestion: 1
was a pause: 1
wand went over: 1
outstretched to grapple: 1
that'll take a: 1
that the spell: 1
her army would: 1
thumpy if you: 1
officer now you: 1
second granger apparently: 1
raising a wand: 1
now to fire: 1
theory he was: 1
finally she'd gone: 1
either they came: 1
that harry potter: 1
and try to: 1
anything in front: 1
or chainmail the: 1
but theodore was: 1
him with her: 1
all could've missed: 1
was a slight: 1
tone belled through: 1
on her arm: 1
she could never: 1
that she didn't: 1
he'd ever seen: 1
yet it was: 1
generations of being: 1
all point of: 1
just barely managed: 1
bellatrix black had: 1
followed the chaos: 1
hight daphne of: 1
actually hit -: 1
you could build: 1
her blade of: 1
to ask does: 1
into the wall: 1
first-year students using: 1
her and quietly: 1
quite a position: 1
see it in: 1
both moving slowly: 1
and what other: 1
and not thinking: 1
a stupefy can: 1
the territory itself: 1
leveled his wand: 1
so theodore was: 1
where they'd gone: 1
to think in: 1
once said hermione: 1
object of her: 1
crash draco's vision: 1
to point to: 1
just in case: 1
lasted longer lagann: 1
draco had to: 1
malfoy prismatis cried: 1
was sunday the: 1
because she'd watched: 1
cast anyway now: 1
and iridescent compasses: 1
red light went: 1
each time and: 1
where gregory and: 1
so draco yelled: 1
she remembered seeing: 1
knew had been: 1
supervise battles once: 1
blood challenges but: 1
chaotic lieutenant said: 1
theodore was already: 1
them but he: 1
neville longbottom and: 1
next generation's power: 1
so the chaotic: 1
you weren't soliciting: 1
try this if: 1
to test them: 1
as much as: 1
ground and she: 1
hogwarts lit by: 1
sword looked like: 1
realized it but: 1
went past her: 1
to change quickly: 1
fire again but: 1
with her blade: 1
the end of: 1
said equably his: 1
one did anything: 1
fact neville had: 1
remnants of dragon: 1
beneath the grey: 1
faces beneath the: 1
shot at her: 1
corner of her: 1
the magic she: 1
circle a diamond: 1
and draco could: 1
the grab of: 1
enemies were doing: 1
seem truly lordly: 1
didn't start to: 1
suggested - that's: 1
to keep moving: 1
she was remembering: 1
soldiers falling over: 1
when her voice: 1
after eight centuries: 1
the dueling forms: 1
end of the: 1
the way and: 1
stained glass now: 1
had been in: 1
and when she: 1
flew and there: 1
red jet of: 1
battle said harry's: 1
dragon army casting: 1
want to say: 1
were parted and: 1
you he knew: 1
in an undignified: 1
had been designated: 1
hermione granger heard: 1
saw the two: 1
it wasn't very: 1
person in hogwarts: 1
later on when: 1
as he just: 1
hermione frantically pushed: 1
and scented shampoo: 1
blade of light: 1
and jenny rustad: 1
the spell right: 1
know if you: 1
link up with: 1
doing i think: 1
stopped and she: 1
of experience had: 1
made a diamond: 1
face but his: 1
resent this and: 1
what it could: 1
compass was the: 1
cried padma's voice: 1
huge and she: 1
the talking noises: 1
now except another: 1
the next battle: 1
draco couldn't figure: 1
her in the: 1
not thinking fast: 1
honestly meant to: 1
her troops would: 1
hand ernie was: 1
eyes were huge: 1
straining at her: 1
had secretly met: 1
saw that hannah's: 1
said it's kind: 1
dragons and even: 1
her i can: 1
dint of constant: 1
multicolored iridescent sheen: 1
hadn't practiced at: 1
chose what seemed: 1
and the dragons: 1
blade it's only: 1
her attack i'm: 1
one neither corridor: 1
she realized that: 1
still had a: 1
sunshine general was: 1
said this was: 1
slaughters the dragons: 1
trying to dodge: 1
wasn't very impressive: 1
to dodge at: 1
been getting pretty: 1
and i think: 1
they followed the: 1
in command you: 1
almost sent her: 1
chainmail the sunshine: 1
other side of: 1
whispering fearful rumors: 1
watching but i: 1
draco was not: 1
here soon and: 1
blaise zabini from: 1
was harry's work: 1
started running it: 1
own parents and: 1
didn't want to: 1
hoped general granger: 1
and neville followed: 1
had suggested -: 1
even trying to: 1
be thinking of: 1
undignified heap as: 1
everyone was staring: 1
daphne as they: 1
and they'd agreed: 1
designated soldiers in: 1
your house be: 1
to seem truly: 1
dodged it and: 1
sigh are you: 1
expelliarmus and theodore's: 1
hadn't been looking: 1
he attacks them: 1
it wasn't fair: 1
on his face: 1
i think they: 1
the prismatic sphere: 1
allied so he's: 1
other in half: 1
it directly at: 1
students would stabilize: 1
and then passing: 1
the game changed: 1
stopped and caught: 1
a quick silencing: 1
incantation ravum calvaria: 1
apparent direction started: 1
small motions in: 1
but they hadn't: 1
for this battle: 1
neville with her: 1
him the noble: 1
it's the charm: 1
the effort screamed: 1
doesn't this count: 1
thoroughly explained to: 1
a boy and: 1
in the right: 1
draco and then: 1
had to be: 1
from beneath the: 1
lookout just in: 1
wanted to take: 1
here i must: 1
and it went: 1
found each other: 1
in whispering fearful: 1
hogwarts to notice: 1
and she should've: 1
she didn't start: 1
was a little: 1
transfiguring a muggle: 1
changing its architectural: 1
lecture from her: 1
to match exactly: 1
girl breathing in: 1
over the faces: 1
twisted that had: 1
calvaria lucis gladius: 1
was obviously stronger: 1
who just barely: 1
was to make: 1
looks like chaos: 1
think they got: 1
denial about the: 1
way tonare shouted: 1
remember at all: 1
he had enough: 1
like she imagined: 1
legion harry potter: 1
them said ron: 1
that was practically: 1
up quite a: 1
ask does anyone: 1
after they stopped: 1
they hadn't actually: 1
largest one he'd: 1
the hood got: 1
them on a: 1
that the other: 1
we'd better try: 1
have termed it: 1
harry's voice shrieked: 1
screamed the word: 1
wands at her: 1
some kind of: 1
fighting than soldiers: 1
when she scrambled: 1
they all could've: 1
the rooms and: 1
a y-intersection an: 1
ever try this: 1
standing alongside him: 1
swimming now from: 1
it felt like: 1
then because they: 1
even as harry: 1
harry's work somehow: 1
he knew he: 1
taking down a: 1
lieutenant said after: 1
leviosa they'd practiced: 1
spell back at: 1
over their faces: 1
thoughts that flashed: 1
so shocked that: 1
to be the: 1
would sap her: 1
and you had: 1
already be better: 1
artifact nope harry: 1
me back to: 1
larger threat of: 1
his feet so: 1
a time by: 1
forward steadily to: 1
the corridors harry: 1
grey cloth over: 1
practiced as much: 1
captain macmillan and: 1
wasn't really violating: 1
this was harry's: 1
heap as she: 1
failed castings that: 1
have fluffed her: 1
daphne's mind as: 1
lately as boys: 1
him draco was: 1
should have fluffed: 1
a good strategy: 1
harry or harry's: 1
even the occasional: 1
was a strong: 1
crashed into the: 1
some part of: 1
change even after: 1
been hard to: 1
the jumble of: 1
engage each other: 1
the air a: 1
ron - somnium: 1
let's see what: 1
felt like she: 1
a sunshine general: 1
on a daily: 1
just barely dodged: 1
to his feet: 1
muggleborn and you'd: 1
the battle and: 1
at them but: 1
passing statues of: 1
beater's bat and: 1
of hogwarts where: 1
she began falling: 1
she'd better not: 1
- and theodore's: 1
and never found: 1
spell to cast: 1
standing there you: 1
they'll slice each: 1
draco knew had: 1
hold both compasses: 1
fault but i'm: 1
with him soon: 1
had said this: 1
to grapple so: 1
do to walk: 1
and caught their: 1
you could be: 1
wand perfectly formed: 1
was just stronger: 1
macmillan spoke up: 1
would go as: 1
territory itself was: 1
am i supposed: 1
shirts you've already: 1
try a quick: 1
her hair billowing: 1
legion following dragon: 1
eight designated soldiers: 1
with a surprisingly: 1
enemies you pretend: 1
maintaining contegos around: 1
battle would soon: 1
harry said i: 1
said blaise zabini: 1
sabotage his potential: 1
been given their: 1
to his hands: 1
does anyone know: 1
for using lightsabers: 1
quickly then they: 1
started laughing with: 1
but parvati patil: 1
and hit chaos: 1
not just the: 1
me her wand: 1
observation the rooms: 1
be a muggle: 1
plain glass or: 1
you did you're: 1
moved aside and: 1
over and over: 1
harry nodded keeping: 1
scrambling to his: 1
it i read: 1
be the first: 1
quite without saying: 1
next battle she: 1
time to put: 1
for days and: 1
like it was: 1
it even if: 1
keep moving this: 1
pace through the: 1
from her wand: 1
somnium and then: 1
theodore was haloed: 1
affected by magic: 1
actually and doesn't: 1
credit for using: 1
protecting the remnants: 1
harry's voice while: 1
realized that hannah: 1
sort of tactic: 1
other they were: 1
hands and shrieked: 1
to her left: 1
she flew and: 1
he dodged and: 1
stronger than him: 1
of weeks isn't: 1
and when her: 1
sunshine general who: 1
strategy she believed: 1
ideas either they: 1
- that's weird: 1
the air toward: 1
it should have: 1
her when her: 1
behind general potter: 1
shot another sleep: 1
so hard it: 1
to hold both: 1
get into positions: 1
over her head: 1
the malfoy tradition: 1
down the rest: 1
slight pause as: 1
other army you: 1
let your house: 1
feet began to: 1
in their grey: 1
voice desperately cried: 1
solidity - in: 1
her wand made: 1
miss and finally: 1
boy's feet were: 1
i guess i: 1
they had to: 1
you're superman said: 1
hex once said: 1
was not to: 1
some wizards used: 1
him they trudged: 1
potter by now: 1
she'd told him: 1
use but they: 1
within the circle: 1
voice from behind: 1
before her attack: 1
as transfiguring a: 1
something even after: 1
somnium and this: 1
the circle over: 1
her head turned: 1
hadn't practiced doing: 1
maneuvering but parvati: 1
open and crashed: 1
captain macmillan spoke: 1
malfoy now before: 1
we still moving: 1
hermione said so: 1
when harry pointed: 1
dance unfortunately there's: 1
of plain glass: 1
were both moving: 1
said i checked: 1
not to resent: 1
shrieked stupefy and: 1
unconscious padma was: 1
draco couldn't take: 1
they cast it: 1
condescending sigh are: 1
the officer group: 1
practice dueling with: 1
you pretend you're: 1
light dulak and: 1
that led to: 1
left and she: 1
heard of her: 1
conceding the battle: 1
neville hadn't been: 1
and leveled his: 1
and was still: 1
her but it: 1
sent draco to: 1
map where the: 1
this too once: 1
i read about: 1
experience had honed: 1
left fist higher: 1
position but draco: 1
the air diminished: 1
of god or: 1
anything but stare: 1
the location of: 1
her she fell: 1
still no matter: 1
dragon can link: 1
went out again: 1
light like it: 1
at her but: 1
on extra muscle: 1
she shouted tonare: 1
going to promote: 1
had professor quirrell: 1
jenny and parvati: 1
the ground hello: 1
shouted draco and: 1
and how had: 1
only a few: 1
truly lordly now: 1
hesitate to fire: 1
practiced among themselves: 1
from when they'd: 1
realism you had: 1
had maintained their: 1
magical drain almost: 1
flashed through daphne's: 1
only hermione granger's: 1
getting close to: 1
wand in both: 1
she fell in: 1
wasn't enough her: 1
in his side: 1
using lightsabers at: 1
general potter and: 1
to give them: 1
that can defeat: 1
order said harry's: 1
different result harry: 1
and when the: 1
to go -: 1
keep underestimating me: 1
hood got anyone: 1
right direction said: 1
keeping his eyes: 1
army found the: 1
lord was just: 1
as giving away: 1
lips were parted: 1
daphne of the: 1
course toward where: 1
up suddenly frowning: 1
we're the grey: 1
were maneuvering but: 1
falling over and: 1
despite that transient: 1
learn the ground: 1
directly between themselves: 1
in the next: 1
and the hufflepuff: 1
to fire they'd: 1
not invincible a: 1
had recovered enough: 1
of the sun: 1
shuffle through what: 1
theodore laughed and: 1
patil and jenny: 1
to signal the: 1
same here i: 1
jet shot at: 1
pretty cool don't: 1
through the stone-floored: 1
book it would: 1
and corridors of: 1
her wand kept: 1
their front and: 1
at harry or: 1
an athletic one: 1
of her crush: 1
in plate armor: 1
she slashed out: 1
at all while: 1
own wand on: 1
the corridors to: 1
fearful rumors about: 1
corridors for a: 1
and then a: 1
of the battle: 1
hermione and harry: 1
still managed to: 1
front and she: 1
feet and as: 1
as evilly as: 1
and then after: 1
his hands and: 1
over harry would: 1

but two soldiers: 1
whether they'll slice: 1
drastically as harry's: 1
said leveling his: 1
not to let: 1

neville of the: 1
i'm starting to: 1
she knew how: 1
we get close: 1
without changing its: 1
as fast as: 1
a daily basis: 1
without those compasses: 1
a difficult feat: 1
attacked each other: 1
pause as everyone: 1
a while that's: 1
directly at her: 1
from beneath his: 1
we getting close: 1
gasps slowly whacked: 1
such fast succession: 1
them instead of: 1
hexes daphne heard: 1
any ambush their: 1
her mind so: 1
centuries hogwarts was: 1
and she began: 1
malfoy had maintained: 1
mind so hard: 1
of course harry: 1
and her own: 1

one another avoid: 1
and neville keeping: 1
and dragon attacked: 1
later neville's voice: 1
ground well here's: 1
changed since bellatrix: 1

castings that would: 1
aim for the: 1

now and how: 1
point of order: 1
draco's vision was: 1

a beater's bat: 1
hermione frowned trying: 1
of slytherin had: 1
wizards used to: 1

afford any failed: 1
said after a: 1
again hermione could: 1
hannah's voice desperately: 1

made a fist: 1
the huge magical: 1
but i still: 1
as he could: 1
back at harry: 1
her feet and: 1
dragons started running: 1
abruptly yanked up: 1
to support one: 1
near miss and: 1
of trying to: 1
harry chose what: 1
targets of any: 1
wizard-knight in plate: 1
be dragged down: 1
blasted toward her: 1
the stunning hex: 1
it's kind of: 1
place in the: 1
defeat me now: 1

of hearing people: 1
the fiery and: 1
super hermione her: 1
ranks of soldiers: 1
do finally she'd: 1
her feet into: 1
not an athletic: 1
and ron if: 1
when the blazing: 1
they all ignored: 1
your fault but: 1
with their wands: 1
couldn't see sleep: 1
enough and still: 1
mind as she: 1
the red jet: 1
becoming stronger than: 1
front of her: 1
would hesitate to: 1
harry potter it's: 1
result harry had: 1
wand began making: 1
from behind her: 1
daphne had lasted: 1
pointing always to: 1
seemed to trigger: 1
challenges but she: 1
and anthony had: 1
a bad feeling: 1
the first targets: 1
her off the: 1
persisted in whispering: 1
each other in: 1
harry there was: 1
of the corridor: 1
kind of mixed-in: 1
with lightsabers of: 1
rather than harry: 1
enough plays to: 1
the force keeping: 1
them a sunshine: 1
the backlog the: 1
was too weak: 1
sprung into existence: 1
she'd lectured her: 1
you're pretty cool: 1
his own strength: 1
he couldn't keep: 1
spell was taking: 1
really hoped general: 1
he'd been rising: 1
better of the: 1
just as theodore: 1
neville and the: 1
merely being his: 1
only that she: 1
their enemies were: 1
tingle on her: 1
yelled let's see: 1
still moving in: 1
started to change: 1
into someone else: 1
generals draco knew: 1
blade at neville: 1
hermione granger's hand: 1
voice we'll be: 1
it didn't count: 1
alongside him with: 1
they trudged on: 1
was becoming stronger: 1
each other which: 1
used it yet: 1
knees but she: 1
the way said: 1
poured through her: 1
parted and everything: 1
legal for noble: 1
- no hermione: 1
let me be: 1
soldiers and at: 1
greengrass daphne's wand: 1
just as four: 1
for long that: 1
her left and: 1
was the malfoy: 1
and made way: 1
could guess where: 1
do some might: 1
ears because she'd: 1
on the backlog: 1
trying to muster: 1
power over a: 1
her went quite: 1
in such fast: 1
his face but: 1
bad feeling about: 1
the dueling-grade stunner: 1
at all point: 1
in denial about: 1
in both hands: 1
sure that his: 1
who was obviously: 1
draco just as: 1
wand came up: 1
can remember the: 1
fast succession and: 1
and since nobody: 1
you and what: 1
spells in such: 1
sleep hexes daphne: 1
than soldiers who: 1
stunbolt back at: 1
remember the instructions: 1
at neville and: 1
dragons and by: 1
tire his soldiers: 1
the lord you: 1
dodge at all: 1
trigger some part: 1
agreed to all: 1
that fifth spell: 1
and not just: 1
really your fault: 1
engaged the larger: 1
hermione could feel: 1
hit your own: 1
against general potter: 1
put on extra: 1
side that time: 1
can link up: 1
the wall revealing: 1
hogwarts draco had: 1
to say anything: 1
fair that the: 1
practically conceding the: 1
and ways to: 1
up panting she: 1
i didn't want: 1
their grey cloaks: 1
wand - draco: 1
to remember death: 1
by myself then: 1
stupefy can still: 1
to describe the: 1
she practiced as: 1
he did the: 1
chaos from behind: 1
morale and anthony: 1
his feet began: 1
take a lot: 1
army slaughters the: 1
hand pushed forward: 1
- but there: 1
to officer now: 1
wand kept rehearsing: 1
spatial visualization and: 1
the sunshine soldiers: 1
that arrogant but: 1
as she rose: 1
daphne heard a: 1
but draco couldn't: 1
with us said: 1
than him draco: 1
stronger than her: 1
embarrassing not to: 1
would already be: 1
throw a tantrum: 1
completely out of: 1
the next generation's: 1
voices crying somnium: 1
and corridors changed: 1
feat even for: 1
count as transfiguring: 1
feet into ron: 1
everything the lady: 1
secret corridors all: 1
sweaty from when: 1
it was all: 1
tip of hermione's: 1
voice of neville: 1
swung to point: 1
more and they: 1
the remnants of: 1
students using weak: 1
some might call: 1
voice we're invincible: 1
compass that led: 1
last scion of: 1
said hermione granger: 1
no one did: 1
give them extra: 1
with hermione granger: 1
good ideas either: 1
her soldiers falling: 1
all what was: 1
fiery and iridescent: 1
loudly from across: 1
was seeming downright: 1
when she was: 1
artifact anymore but: 1
read about the: 1
her wand perfectly: 1
in hogwarts statues: 1
and she summoned: 1
another red jet: 1
absently this had: 1
them but they: 1
nevvy once again: 1
where rooms and: 1
lay unconscious padma: 1
that would sap: 1
a multicolored iridescent: 1
nearby a boy: 1
wand at her: 1
noticing that in: 1
chaos without changing: 1
to attack them: 1
yes said harry: 1
a strong witch: 1
the way tonare: 1
so whatever you: 1
of chaos from: 1
unfazed by a: 1
demeanors and flattery: 1
its reflections like: 1
nobody would ever: 1
she rose she: 1
stronger and you: 1
that draco realized: 1
statues so some: 1
quirrell had recovered: 1
rustad were currently: 1
happen draco would: 1
just the map: 1
left that can: 1
they stopped and: 1
there was no: 1
harry dodged it: 1
wand went flying: 1
to walk forward: 1
of her soldiers: 1
then passing statues: 1
black had escaped: 1
wall in front: 1
face - i: 1
their footsteps sounded: 1
and she shouted: 1
that weight strapped: 1
the right direction: 1
steadily to level: 1
on lecturing her: 1
somnium and that: 1
own wand began: 1
the common ranks: 1
of her cast: 1
from beside her: 1
but they had: 1
a little less: 1
of noisy they: 1
said loudly from: 1
even if they: 1
they weren't fighting: 1
harry which in: 1
grey cloaks grey: 1
this part inside: 1
fighting each other: 1
now that draco: 1
and dragons and: 1
or apparent solidity: 1
been a good: 1
hermione raised her: 1
every closet for: 1
when we get: 1
most powerful sometimes: 1
first try she: 1
longbottom and another: 1
the direction of: 1
after only a: 1
hannah was staring: 1
lot of time: 1
her officers had: 1
how had professor: 1
supposed to be: 1
other boy wasn't: 1
lady mother had: 1
shouted code seven: 1
sunshine regiment by: 1
two figures in: 1

to promote me: 1
to trigger some: 1
ages and since: 1
stunning hex once: 1
of her into: 1
before they engaged: 1
and they were: 1
grasped her wand: 1
slashed out with: 1
and managed to: 1
their wands out: 1
cast but she: 1
been a very: 1
work somehow it: 1
the start of: 1
supporting her hovered: 1
common ranks of: 1
soldiers as fast: 1
honed and so: 1
until almost too: 1
footsteps sounded a: 1
a live wire: 1
if you belonged: 1
into a wall: 1
months ago i: 1
anymore he didn't: 1
hitting theodore the: 1

red bolt burst: 1
from across the: 1
specific mr potter: 1
succession and theodore: 1
regiment for too: 1
of the two: 1
her soldiers to: 1
good spell to: 1
the diamond within: 1
and refusing to: 1
herself she'd told: 1
understanding that you: 1
people keep underestimating: 1
changed drastically as: 1
the charm of: 1
why yes said: 1
- stupidity is: 1
remembered seeing in: 1
the most powerful: 1
leisurely pace through: 1
stood facing sunshine's: 1
voice followed a: 1
he really hoped: 1
sunshine soldiers in: 1
hermione said absently: 1
prismatis cried padma's: 1
soliciting traitors if: 1
out of them: 1
hallways she crashed: 1
draco realized it: 1
all catching up: 1
glass now and: 1
of hogwarts lit: 1
for a time: 1
hermione's own wand: 1
sleep hex at: 1
toward the location: 1
ago i wonder: 1
potter let me: 1
athletic one he: 1
could it felt: 1
to put chaos: 1
the barrier we'll: 1
lady her mother: 1
changing in front: 1
this count as: 1
sunshine regiment harry: 1
other boy's feet: 1
her as she: 1
figures in the: 1
a condescending sigh: 1
could do to: 1
a prismatic wall: 1
knew it wasn't: 1
fluffed her hair: 1
flattery and scented: 1
doesn't work -: 1
theodore the other: 1
numbness in his: 1
underestimating me her: 1
at neville longbottom: 1
the instructions right: 1
granger apparently had: 1
wall somnium shrieked: 1
weight strapped on: 1
those compasses they: 1
at that kind: 1
since bellatrix black: 1
less effort new: 1
fully formed and: 1
lagann said neville's: 1
was remembering this: 1
had to keep: 1
the boy-who-lived like: 1
his wand -: 1
so harry chose: 1
draco and theodore: 1
soon afterward draco: 1
would tire his: 1
explained to draco: 1
from behind general: 1
is different and: 1
a peg you: 1
her and she: 1
hex and so: 1
granger's hand and: 1
would have termed: 1
would cost them: 1
i think dragon's: 1
to do finally: 1
drain almost sent: 1
other two generals: 1
weak - but: 1
and captain bones: 1
of her history: 1
your army who: 1
a leisurely pace: 1
to move until: 1
is doing the: 1
laughter almost as: 1
to muster the: 1
harry potter by: 1
potter just thinks: 1
but his voice: 1
exactly what she: 1
bent in quite: 1
he could if: 1
harry regretting only: 1
lucis gladius the: 1
permanence the defense: 1
formed harry dodged: 1
the presence of: 1
chaotic legionnaires started: 1
she just pointed: 1
longbottom was seeming: 1
dragon army without: 1
to deny it: 1
again harry's voice: 1
the ravenclaw girl: 1
little numbness in: 1
strong witch but: 1
for merely being: 1
history books though: 1
and another red: 1
of hogwarts still: 1
to sunshine potter: 1
her cast but: 1
the others but: 1
sheen to indicate: 1
could they she: 1
army you think: 1
ringing tone belled: 1
so father had: 1
by comparison if: 1
people but despite: 1
each time not: 1
felt a lot: 1
themselves could they: 1
staring at neville: 1
and quietly casting: 1
you anyway and: 1
chaos's other army: 1
time the stunbolt: 1
not yet -: 1
harry would be: 1
was hitting theodore: 1
new contego shields: 1
had begun to: 1
should be thinking: 1
hex it didn't: 1
said good idea: 1
her mind she'd: 1
lectured her soldiers: 1
weird captain macmillan: 1
of chaos said: 1
began falling in: 1
grab of the: 1
wand and pointing: 1
quite the right: 1
know said hermione: 1
expecting a different: 1
you got nevvy: 1
the gryffindor boy: 1
the incantation ravum: 1
soldiers couldn't delay: 1
she'd gone off: 1
another of her: 1
of being second: 1
stabilized the drain: 1
but she thought: 1
everyone moved aside: 1
few months ago: 1
defeat invincible enemies: 1
draco would have: 1
the lieutenants are: 1
hogwarts a battle: 1
- luminos shouted: 1
facing sunshine's entire: 1
her own courtship: 1
this time the: 1
already scrambling to: 1
just pointed the: 1
captain goldstein and: 1
motion toward the: 1
much she'd lectured: 1
it would have: 1
couldn't see the: 1
managed to leap: 1
oh no it's: 1
stupefy the red: 1
went quite without: 1
hello there sunshine: 1
went over her: 1
for noble and: 1
in the upper: 1
macmillan and they'd: 1
arrogant but am: 1
but she couldn't: 1
your opponents for: 1
close to them: 1
in your army: 1
neville of chaos: 1
when daphne hit: 1
voice high and: 1
hogwarts sometimes moved: 1
and then said: 1
even after eight: 1
just being fashionable: 1
still a little: 1
said harry potter: 1
she'd managed to: 1
that it's not: 1
might be embarrassing: 1
with her twenty-three: 1
have to ask: 1
her hovered her: 1
draco still managed: 1
part inside of: 1
signal eight designated: 1
think dragon's not: 1
couldn't keep this: 1
her hair about: 1
largest active contingent: 1
rainbow wall in: 1
from in between: 1
dragon attacked each: 1
she wanted her: 1
strapped on harry: 1
cast the spell: 1
beneath the hood: 1
doors at the: 1
grinned as evilly: 1
so had been: 1
gotten in four: 1
go - her: 1
one of those: 1
through the air: 1
and that was: 1
her head and: 1
casting four spells: 1
the sort of: 1
the map where: 1
lieutenants are wearing: 1
shouted go and: 1
unfortunately there's nothing: 1
scion of nott: 1
and he should: 1
have been hard: 1
indicate chaos the: 1
down potter herself: 1
there was suddenly: 1
prismatic wall shattering: 1
also went without: 1
few seconds no: 1
and sunshine didn't: 1
caught their breath: 1
occasional wizard-knight in: 1
diminished again hermione: 1
to take down: 1
to level her: 1
change quickly then: 1
time he aimed: 1
soldiers to just: 1
front of draco: 1
you honestly meant: 1
you know they: 1
followed a moment: 1
by understanding that: 1
well here's super: 1
on this stuff: 1
stretched over the: 1
same thing and: 1
somnium curse you: 1
looked like she: 1
they were maneuvering: 1
too many soldiers: 1
high ringing tone: 1
you'd watched certain: 1
invincible a stupefy: 1
the stability of: 1
the book it: 1
straight out and: 1
was still being: 1
on the other: 1
rather well said: 1
lips parted and: 1
magic expelliarmus and: 1
since nobody would: 1
with his arms: 1
lordly now and: 1
his eye where: 1
once again harry's: 1
last person in: 1
hand one compass: 1
chaos and dragon: 1
way for her: 1
other chaotic legionnaires: 1
around the officer: 1
charms straining at: 1
you served that: 1
his potential position: 1
test it i: 1
without saying and: 1
stupefy shrieked the: 1
that this time: 1
just use somnium: 1
know that spell: 1
got on the: 1
you hermione said: 1
troop morale and: 1
anymore i think: 1
forward and as: 1
among themselves how: 1
of witches and: 1
being stupidly proud: 1
yanked up -: 1
two figures almost: 1
rehearsing the gesture: 1
this had been: 1
hermione a few: 1
always to the: 1
for the face: 1
greengrass of sunshine: 1
spent all their: 1
and blood challenges: 1
ron if chaos: 1
neville walked at: 1
malfoy watched two: 1
weren't fighting first-year: 1
the same thing: 1
any lower than: 1
at harry who: 1
a good spell: 1
seeing in the: 1
how people keep: 1
agreement against traitors: 1
chaos the other: 1
higher in the: 1
almost as well: 1
the eight soldiers: 1
shouted tonare the: 1
it and when: 1
hit the ground: 1
and still trying: 1
row if he: 1
her lady mother: 1
four chaotic voices: 1
hitting each other: 1
bit thumpy if: 1
moment later draco: 1
light smashed right: 1
red jet shot: 1
wide corridor with: 1
and it looks: 1
about what harry: 1
couple of weeks: 1
others but a: 1
getting hit and: 1
a peg general: 1
finally she grasped: 1
making small motions: 1
point of fact: 1
she desperately twisted: 1
be recharging his: 1
of the largest: 1
anthony and ron: 1
see what you: 1
charm on this: 1
was a signal: 1
cloaks grey cloth: 1
tactic chaos would: 1
to be careful: 1
to draco that: 1
she had to: 1
contegos around the: 1
they'd agreed to: 1
she crashed into: 1
position the ravenclaw: 1
no the sunshine: 1
- in the: 1
slowly whacked at: 1
upper reach of: 1
girl's eyes were: 1
was being stupidly: 1
corridor with their: 1
to fire again: 1
or potter just: 1
in half if: 1
existence in front: 1
this stuff when: 1
as harry would: 1
and expecting a: 1
too late as: 1
could take down: 1
to think you: 1
quietly casting wingardium: 1
figure it out: 1
so draco had: 1
to understand and: 1
flipendo and the: 1
be and he: 1
she summoned up: 1
of hypotheses and: 1
the dragon general: 1
theodore's back hit: 1
giving them a: 1
winded he couldn't: 1
to maneuver out: 1
the blazing shape: 1
never found each: 1
of light smashed: 1
and hit the: 1
it good at: 1
both compasses and: 1
thud of another: 1
officers had decided: 1
anyone know whether: 1
didn't engage each: 1
they she knew: 1
this battle said: 1
but she had: 1
a few months: 1
sunshine would go: 1
frowning at the: 1
more actually and: 1
to indicate chaos: 1
say said harry: 1
spell oh no: 1
was uncertain and: 1
cool don't you: 1
and she should: 1
getting close i: 1
that transient permanence: 1
army seemingly unfazed: 1
to shuffle through: 1
boy gave a: 1
heard a soft: 1
to get into: 1
which was a: 1
harry spoke the: 1
of hogwarts sometimes: 1
hogwarts still had: 1
their wands at: 1
see from the: 1
a military realism: 1
the hover charms: 1
ron where he'd: 1
and flickered in: 1
at him draco: 1
did the evil: 1
own courtship to: 1
stare at neville: 1
scrambled up panting: 1
you know said: 1
kind of noisy: 1
pointed they couldn't: 1
and the sunshine: 1
the two figures: 1
fast anymore i: 1
out again so: 1
backlog the dragon: 1
and finally draco: 1
shocked that she: 1
pause as nearby: 1
in between hermione: 1
were abruptly yanked: 1
at spatial visualization: 1
time not to: 1
good at spatial: 1
hermione her hand: 1
obvious fact that: 1
dozen sleep hexes: 1
another sleep hex: 1
those figures already: 1
a long wide: 1
you dodged when: 1
matter how much: 1
decided would be: 1
yeah said ernie: 1
army a high: 1
as everyone looked: 1
structure wasn't any: 1
weren't soliciting traitors: 1
each other that: 1
side of chaos: 1
spoke the tip: 1
over and the: 1
the agreement against: 1
had decided would: 1
i must say: 1
of chaos were: 1
thought her troops: 1
served that was: 1
couldn't take it: 1
upper reaches of: 1
or why as: 1
was a tingle: 1
now from casting: 1
you still had: 1
would have felt: 1
dueling with all: 1
rising from the: 1
he didn't bother: 1
signaled her soldiers: 1
would soon be: 1
ravum calvaria lucis: 1
potter thinks we're: 1
attacks them separately: 1
say as clearly: 1
if you were: 1
in fact right: 1
neville were learning: 1
their own compasses: 1
parents and was: 1
well said harry's: 1
she just barely: 1
as she practiced: 1
susan getting hit: 1
of fact neville: 1
enemy soldiers would: 1
had been given: 1
me you know: 1
into ron -: 1
what other army: 1
start of the: 1
regretting only that: 1
tow but no: 1
captain bones and: 1
a circle a: 1
shouted neville of: 1
never quite believe: 1
in point of: 1
who hadn't practiced: 1
what their enemies: 1
you need taking: 1
staring at -: 1
grey cloaks and: 1
anyway and then: 1
saw similar frowns: 1
summoned up all: 1
sunshine regiment for: 1
the ground anew: 1
over again sunday: 1
her and her: 1
escaped the heir: 1
huge black-wooden doors: 1
moving fast anymore: 1
count as giving: 1
battle to sunshine: 1
a signal eight: 1
testing or why: 1
chaos said neville's: 1
her flight stopped: 1
it just wasn't: 1
went without saying: 1
but draco still: 1
the obvious fact: 1
me be specific: 1
and the force: 1
chaos were missing: 1
be better at: 1
listened closely so: 1
trying to understand: 1
knew how she: 1
had given all: 1
can defeat me: 1
he twisted that: 1
to notice how: 1
and doesn't this: 1
you've already lost: 1
and made a: 1
the gesture to: 1
of the others: 1
noises coming from: 1
and chaos without: 1
the other army: 1
that hermione granger: 1
the other side: 1
wall revealing two: 1
that's why you: 1
currently maintaining contegos: 1
always be the: 1
proud and refusing: 1
too busy frantically: 1
for her also: 1
up theodore wasn't: 1
in slow motion: 1
contego shield to: 1
i checked that: 1
be specific mr: 1
hard to describe: 1
general granger got: 1
pointed the incandescent: 1
working out what: 1
on the first: 1
last word that: 1
location of the: 1
as she flew: 1
saw out of: 1
was still sustaining: 1
lot less effort: 1
frowned trying to: 1
us first and: 1
be a difficult: 1
all while draco: 1
ignored the talking: 1
then the gryffindor: 1
said so whatever: 1
plays to remember: 1
time to think: 1
would ever try: 1
metallic-sounding crash draco's: 1
heir of slytherin: 1
intercept course toward: 1
to mix directly: 1
he should be: 1
think you need: 1
drain was a: 1
are you going: 1
when they'd all: 1
close neville said: 1
people looked directly: 1
lord you served: 1
she spoke the: 1
stopped talking and: 1
he was testing: 1
of neville longbottom: 1
sunshine soldiers were: 1
if you honestly: 1
quite believe she'd: 1
they came to: 1
and harry potter's: 1
a little shy: 1
had escaped the: 1
i could take: 1
a direct intercept: 1
cloaks just standing: 1
she knew even: 1
transient permanence the: 1
hopeless without me: 1
bore it and: 1
soldiers supporting her: 1
i understand that: 1
other that was: 1
looked like that: 1
accept aid against: 1
feet so there: 1
way and when: 1
her and then: 1
the faces of: 1
you couldn't always: 1
taking you down: 1
the ground with: 1
enough to supervise: 1
but you still: 1
dozen generations of: 1
now and the: 1
drop her but: 1
they engaged the: 1
while draco had: 1
his arms outstretched: 1
you just had: 1
second in command: 1
over britain for: 1
of march professor: 1
huge prismatic sphere: 1
i wonder if: 1
went flying that: 1
her history books: 1
wasn't even time: 1
moment later by: 1
might call that: 1
in one of: 1
to take them: 1
less still she: 1
tried giving them: 1
hannah's lips were: 1
for the dark: 1
strength she knew: 1
go when harry: 1
everyone looked at: 1
pretend you're superman: 1
other army a: 1
a fist it: 1
to wear it: 1
huge magical drain: 1
one of her: 1
blown off her: 1
hair about her: 1
directly in with: 1
annoying one neither: 1
and blown off: 1
almost completely enveloped: 1
must say said: 1
she should have: 1
been designated to: 1
upper levels of: 1
as boys went: 1
in the grey: 1
go and the: 1
girl was a: 1
the rest of: 1
that in advance: 1
couldn't see his: 1
a lookout just: 1
command you just: 1
to confront neville: 1
slice each other: 1
eye susan getting: 1
zabini from the: 1
and everything the: 1
flickered in its: 1
the face -: 1
whatever you did: 1
her energy you: 1
couldn't always be: 1
see sleep hexes: 1
as she could: 1
at - it: 1
once hermione had: 1
getting pretty interesting: 1
her ears because: 1
dreams and chaos: 1
draco shouted go: 1
muggle artifact nope: 1
first of march: 1
them it wasn't: 1
said hermione she: 1
and she was: 1
should've signaled her: 1
she was too: 1
would feel as: 1
a girl breathing: 1
neville followed we'd: 1
his own wand: 1
have leaped forward: 1
guessed that the: 1
missed stupefy shrieked: 1
invincible enemies you: 1
a duelist's dance: 1
for her but: 1
hood we're the: 1
started whacking at: 1
soldiers finnigan said: 1
but the scion: 1
of time to: 1
general was being: 1
in a row: 1
shimmering rainbow wall: 1
it yet it: 1
balance is different: 1
hoods one of: 1
toward the object: 1
not moving fast: 1
just drop her: 1
boy shouted code: 1
aside just as: 1
then she couldn't: 1
leveling his own: 1
gotten ron where: 1
she cried greengrass: 1
each other with: 1
right her wand: 1
could before her: 1
except another harry: 1
across the barrier: 1
active contingent of: 1
the first of: 1
as clearly as: 1
had sent draco: 1
professor is watching: 1
so he's attacking: 1
and shot another: 1
might figure it: 1
like she could: 1
zabini's mouth we: 1
her most ancient: 1

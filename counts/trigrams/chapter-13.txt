so i perceive: 1
to help himself: 1
part of harry: 1
of course they: 1
that was exactly: 1
if this reflected: 1
neville to come: 1
this wasn't supposed: 1
a group of: 1
it to the: 1
doesn't seem to: 1
pluses at least: 1
like he was: 1

navigating the ever-changing: 1
you if it: 1
hypotheses like his: 1
be exactly the: 1
action cold harry: 1
i did was: 1
by a quotes: 1
a drawing of: 1
appeal failed asking: 1
failed asking the: 1
or your having: 1

was like a: 1
blueberry the note: 1
for a whole: 1
it takes to: 1
once you ruled: 1
to go harry: 1
out really hard: 1
enough and powerful: 1
would have told: 1
see others rising: 1
couldn't recall where: 1
and someone is: 1
anyone caught seriously: 1
a wet glop: 1
down a corridor: 1
face was a: 1
of witnesses was: 1
that you might: 1
the old game: 1
to him like: 1
97 you have: 1
wall and he: 1
happen just by: 1
j k rowling: 1
it harry was: 1
of salazar slytherin: 1
professor sprout turned: 1
harry thought that: 1
that in fact: 1
sighed my life: 1
drawer opportunities to: 1
you were supposed: 1
i have is: 1
self-discovery and go: 1
where he realized: 1
did your mother: 1
their main weapon: 1
his right hand: 1
odd-numbered years -: 1
would be in: 1
he'd been planning: 1
would be if: 1
this no this: 1
to add to: 1
me shouted harry: 1
rules and someone: 1
taking harry's right: 1
easy enough for: 1
the cabinet he'd: 1
trying to save: 1
note that said: 1
that you are: 1
for it harry: 1
still hungry mental: 1
ask a painting: 1
harry stood outside: 1
a pause she: 1
anger was slowly: 1
shouted harry at: 1
for being a: 1
and harry shook: 1
than to say: 1
missed breakfast and: 1
adopted a rather: 1
far away this: 1
he'd thought last: 1
his left hand: 1
this side wasn't: 1
would it be: 1
know that whoever: 1
him my fine: 1
reached out toward: 1
at least not: 1
told myself but: 1
the lady at: 1
this bloody useless: 1
points for it: 1
sounded strangely familiar: 1
things are spiraling: 1
thin wavering voice: 1
tables that seemed: 1
unimaginable a couple: 1
aware of ink: 1
bars and a: 1
he looked up: 1
the door on: 1
with my life: 1
level of his: 1
that i had: 1
cared about me: 1
really did it: 1
mouth more or: 1
make up three: 1
perhaps but not: 1
but there is: 1
stone floor of: 1
eyebrows slowly the: 1
asking the wrong: 1
huddled together looking: 1
is not riddle: 1
was somehow higher: 1
violating the rules: 1
of large rocks: 1
goes to an: 1
robes and underwear: 1
harry took it: 1
he was beginning: 1
now when you: 1
young man i: 1
this one bright: 1
castle has a: 1
trying to navigate: 1
do what they: 1
three other slytherins: 1
mother pick them: 1
clues and then: 1
looked so harry: 1
is it as: 1
i remember hogwarts: 1
back around and: 1
all eyes turned: 1
to hufflepuff sprout: 1
line was in: 1
the painting the: 1
was all that: 1
harry had originally: 1
find amusing he: 1
okay i've got: 1
the note attached: 1
he was a: 1
that while we: 1
state that you: 1
alarm turn up: 1
for rhetorical effect: 1
land speed record: 1
a logical foreshadowed: 1
while watching tv: 1
you repeat that: 1
hogwarts minuses no: 1
back upstairs to: 1
hufflepuff would be: 1
blinked as if: 1
make any sense: 1
going to get: 1
you want it: 1
paused before pulling: 1
until he does: 1
more blueberry on: 1
they looked down: 1
painting the woman: 1
be obliviated still: 1
that he was: 1
000 002 999: 1
state still hungry: 1
and i didn't: 1
laughed harry rose: 1
time now professor: 1
emotions and something: 1
gap and harry: 1
potter and harry: 1
and that only: 1
i missed this: 1
to have blown: 1
books then besides: 1
pink robes that: 1
only not just: 1
he was prepared: 1
middle-aged man paused: 1
so long as: 1
eventuality having visualized: 1
fondness she said: 1
by muggles muggles: 1
had to go: 1
and mcgonagall's transfiguration: 1
anything without being: 1
the slytherins his: 1
handling on one: 1
harry was thinking: 1
had ever seen: 1
i will just: 1
a rather high: 1
harry nodded i: 1
way up to: 1
into a pattern: 1
lady eyed harry: 1
in his throat: 1
one point and: 1
actually was that: 1
is leaving me: 1
already looking at: 1
to bend his: 1
into the wall: 1
again his voice: 1
bit peculiar would: 1
wearing pajamas it: 1
looked around in: 1
ten points for: 1
from windows of: 1
came from do: 1
harry's side sorry: 1
the painting looked: 1
hint i'm looking: 1
thought the line: 1
he blinked as: 1
the fear was: 1
with expressions that: 1
slowly reached up: 1
was screaming in: 1
be prepared harry: 1
thought the note: 1
there had been: 1
you want to: 1
a pattern that: 1
wand out at: 1
up the quieter: 1
i have something: 1
minuses no consistent: 1
in rubber balls: 1
twelve other boys: 1
wars was the: 1
headboard controlled by: 1
at it it: 1
hint you say: 1
said indignantly to: 1
when he'd started: 1
peculiar would it: 1
excuse me i: 1
him any permanent: 1
happen - slowly: 1
was just drawing: 1
he hasn't actually: 1
little woman with: 1
dorm after clambering: 1
brought his hand: 1
an accusing finger: 1
course they are: 1
pan of cherry: 1
a duplicate of: 1
paper harry became: 1
mechanical alarm clock: 1
so i was: 1
toward harry's hands: 1
beginning to trickle: 1
reason it was: 1
flood of introductions: 1
your name i'm: 1
to happen this: 1
best lethal glare: 1
out his hand: 1
coldly keep them: 1
oh the old: 1
the game once: 1
understand the basic: 1
as to not: 1
what happened sorry: 1
right there was: 1
and ask for: 1
done anything without: 1
wisely star wars: 1
bed he saw: 1
magical fix before: 1
one bright blueberry: 1
line for a: 1
okay honestly harry: 1
here at hogwarts: 1
my hufflepuffs and: 1
ravenclaw one for: 1
okay third try: 1
had produced an: 1
and what was: 1
the same one: 1
thoughts at whichever: 1
crazy his body: 1
your hint it: 1
sudden halt as: 1
harry said promptly: 1
around expecting to: 1
look cool by: 1
staggered back with: 1
get his wizard's: 1
a heavy sleeper: 1
at 7 00am: 1
michael verres-evans it: 1
readable you might: 1
heard in his: 1
rule for navigating: 1
was nearly zero: 1
felt like he'd: 1
his anger was: 1
sorry but can: 1
desperate and ultimately: 1
swear that there: 1
back with an: 1
lying on the: 1
new land speed: 1
excuse to sprint: 1
today there is: 1
into his field: 1
himself out of: 1
glop that dropped: 1
he could set: 1
other boys crowded: 1
spells involved but: 1
don't suppose i: 1
it's for a: 1
that it's just: 1
you do seem: 1
fully conscious in: 1
other day you: 1
so much as: 1
nodded i'm not: 1
obvious time-saving plan: 1
will be a: 1
the message he: 1
by a hollow: 1
supposed to go: 1
you are already: 1
was screaming this: 1
moron so the: 1
out what it: 1
as it was: 1
do that the: 1
slow and then: 1
about it or: 1
stuck out a: 1
neville said but: 1
to the books: 1
this point he: 1
at times like: 1
himself felt like: 1
or worrying about: 1
for opportunities to: 1
worry about my: 1
was about trying: 1
trust the message: 1
green-stained glass that: 1
quite regular castle: 1
idea what was: 1
a few days: 1
hand said abracadabra: 1
you for me: 1
for hogwarts what: 1
group of five: 1
neville who took: 1
pajamas pajama penalty: 1
state confused gleehhhhh: 1
it was too: 1
the meal bars: 1
himself as being: 1
taking harry's index: 1
as a part: 1
rocks - as: 1
he probably ought: 1
the cooperation of: 1
is fear that's: 1
harry was screwed: 1
someone else what: 1
something just in: 1
was sounding like: 1
saw some books: 1
get drayage costs: 1
him but it: 1
other spells involved: 1
hufflepuff couldn't seem: 1
or something backup: 1
as the one: 1
how to end: 1
terrible threat from: 1
of course that: 1
his brain hadn't: 1
who's crazy enough: 1
doing then harry: 1
potter he bowed: 1
the last person: 1
corridor that goes: 1
in merlin's name: 1
to solve it: 1
again the note: 1
99 physical state: 1
wand what do: 1

yes i want: 1

who seemed to: 1
it had produced: 1
felt like the: 1
side sorry harry: 1
mechanical pencil he: 1
it certainly served: 1
do you stage: 1
looked up could: 1
room i don't: 1

sprawling out of: 1
shouted harry brandishing: 1
down right left: 1
anyone else here: 1
that settled it: 1
i told myself: 1
flinch until he: 1
up three million: 1
moment staring at: 1
the best time: 1
to look out: 1
keep them off: 1
was only his: 1
as for you: 1
alarm was turned: 1

because the other: 1
painting on the: 1
and i go: 1
rescuing an innocent: 1
are not to: 1
shrugged it hasn't: 1
sense of being: 1
why does everyone: 1
feel like he: 1
still in his: 1
harry executed a: 1
cryptic hint about: 1
note attached to: 1
or anything i'll: 1
earlier while watching: 1
as he got: 1
10 points for: 1
stairs four left: 1
the game you're: 1
mcgonagall's muffled voice: 1
near his bed: 1
into the room's: 1

finally managing to: 1
you i'm sorry: 1
beggars were all: 1
fearsome killing curse: 1
going down that: 1
me little slips: 1
hogwarts and the: 1
he looked back: 1

to wonder well: 1
it is all: 1
those awkward pauses: 1
his head by: 1
warn you messing: 1
had grabbed him: 1
they target you: 1
walking blindly what: 1
hurt me worse: 1
imagination was making: 1
to be the: 1
cried one of: 1
said harry again: 1
smiled smugly i: 1
slytherin and i: 1
on odd-numbered years: 1
hallway that seems: 1
current points minus: 1
an effect that: 1
a specific hint: 1
stop him under: 1
slytherin straight in: 1
expecting something more: 1
quickly neville went: 1

group of six: 1
and it would: 1
up to his: 1
circumstances i'd like: 1

panicky stop you: 1
his stomach felt: 1
her class i: 1
he was sounding: 1

one of those: 1
whispered harry when: 1
his arm and: 1

to file an: 1
a note and: 1
slytherin let go: 1
harry couldn't actually: 1
the floor and: 1
exactly what one: 1
another attempt to: 1
controller - the: 1
harry said you: 1
his hand again: 1
was literally unimaginable: 1
there - and: 1
you're not harry: 1
will only cost: 1
seemed to have: 1
as if the: 1
long trip professor: 1
that's right it: 1

but i probably: 1
sila j k: 1

occurred to harry: 1
me actually neville: 1
study room how: 1
and don't worry: 1
the much older: 1
could do was: 1
to be skeptical: 1
harry walked past: 1

just draped itself: 1
books to know: 1

turned it over: 1
so as to: 1

he would probably: 1
ask the painting: 1
an excuse to: 1
the nearest flight: 1
on them harry: 1
controlled by a: 1
his own way: 1
completely from negative: 1
abruptly as the: 1
under his bed: 1
near the top: 1
no he said: 1

prepared for that: 1
hollow voice that: 1
through the same: 1
stomach which had: 1
read the next: 1
bad in front: 1
private sort of: 1
a boy who: 1
b i'm lost: 1
curse was abracadabra: 1
far from her: 1
in the world: 1
neville - all: 1

just how much: 1
he stay in: 1
curse are the: 1
about me trying: 1
as the game: 1
incredibly deep life: 1
effect that might: 1
answer actually was: 1
as if he: 1
of sheer bafflement: 1
harry lifted his: 1
space with sunlight: 1
the other meal: 1
in his left: 1
the boy-who-lived there: 1
knew something was: 1
suddenly rather angry: 1
a hint you: 1
i probably won't: 1
braver - oh: 1
really angry neville: 1
if they were: 1
we all just: 1
out the drawer: 1

you saw it: 1
either did it: 1
the alarm was: 1
3 he was: 1

gone to hufflepuff: 1
current points 97: 1
thought no he: 1
the slytherins laughed: 1
in search of: 1
current points 99: 1
of self-discovery and: 1
his stomach which: 1
said i'm sort: 1
motion the largest: 1
seem to be: 1
slytherin slowly reached: 1
rather skeptical expression: 1
neville hissed ernie: 1
the thing itself: 1
when he was: 1
going on well: 1
one who'd called: 1
out any simple: 1
if i did: 1
left hand and: 1
picture young man: 1
but unlike the: 1
in stride and: 1
some books and: 1
he didn't feel: 1
life into harry's: 1
slytherin slowly deliberately: 1
behind on the: 1
know if i: 1
go harry hesitated: 1
seven hufflepuffs who: 1
committed some sort: 1
quotes quill such: 1
pulling out the: 1
that had just: 1
and when harry: 1
about being slow: 1
eyes had been: 1
for a game: 1
to the mess: 1
then went back: 1
pushed his own: 1
for directions but: 1
around but there: 1
him i wish: 1
indeed the message: 1
at him my: 1
from between the: 1
his head as: 1
transfiguration class that's: 1
voice that belled: 1
about me in: 1
badly that sometimes: 1
him or something: 1
comfortable and tables: 1
to verify that: 1
harry at the: 1
hint it will: 1
i don't even: 1
weaselnose who was: 1
oh right there: 1
of conscious intervention: 1
always turn out: 1
anyone to go: 1
sheer bafflement on: 1
told the rules: 1
wasn't holding a: 1
you because they: 1
- harry said: 1
an appeal with: 1
for neville who: 1
i suppose neville: 1
the instructions this: 1
thought last night: 1
front of witnesses: 1
do that hissed: 1
hard and put: 1
side there were: 1
drawer that held: 1
angry the cold: 1
harry smiled smugly: 1
saw it and: 1
seem to have: 1
found himself staring: 1
the same motion: 1
that i was: 1
a picture young: 1
more and more: 1
to point at: 1
bars you are: 1
now hoarsened it's: 1
ever heard as: 1
a note points: 1
simple prank he: 1
curse he pretended: 1
that nearly came: 1
your fingers how: 1
why you're trying: 1
it honored to: 1
even begun to: 1
handwriting the note: 1
rather empty he'd: 1
class the way: 1
and a rather: 1
quite a terrible: 1
class maybe he: 1
potter miss his: 1
and how can: 1
his books then: 1
hall that led: 1
itself heard screaming: 1
then this is: 1
of anyone else: 1
that's why they: 1
the stakes of: 1
the right side: 1
something i don't: 1
just any hint: 1
whisper and he: 1
accusing finger at: 1
feeling they'd liked: 1
meet you harry: 1
harry and in: 1
single terrible motion: 1
doing him any: 1
your existence more: 1
observed i think: 1
it not a: 1
draped itself over: 1
the slytherins where: 1
young boy harry: 1
use it wisely: 1
pouch er cancel: 1
bought before departing: 1
70 current points: 1
telling me how: 1
gained 6 meal: 1
a step back: 1
don't suppose you: 1
read some of: 1
curse without having: 1
maybe professor sprout: 1
he continued down: 1
even the boy-who-lived: 1
this reflected some: 1
of his first: 1
but right now: 1
the game here: 1
go or even: 1
who was looking: 1
to his headboard: 1
originally came from: 1
you might realize: 1
he saw a: 1
would have both: 1
hufflepuffs sounding as: 1
take control of: 1
brief pause are: 1
was a rather: 1
quiet oh right: 1
flubberwalt i was: 1
pajamas harry ran: 1
a quotes quill: 1
how it was: 1
you stage a: 1
felt that he: 1
get my box: 1
first full day: 1
pointed hat with: 1
he known he: 1
then knock them: 1
good are everywhere: 1
himself with two: 1
by the wrist: 1
to say i: 1
yes harry said: 1
the order of: 1
00am with the: 1
blankly i did: 1
you start with: 1
ran over a: 1
the logical thought: 1
as it takes: 1
slow now you: 1
to kill us: 1
on the wall: 1
the ravenclaw dorm: 1
harry had grabbed: 1
dumbledore i mean: 1
to stop and: 1
it had chairs: 1
note was inscribed: 1
like harry had: 1
it into the: 1
of the way: 1
the dorm empty: 1
the dorm got: 1
shock as harry: 1
how many points: 1
lying to myself: 1
uptake silence but: 1
my missing breakfast: 1
keep coming out: 1
for missing his: 1
it was her: 1
way they were: 1
sprout was giving: 1
could stand being: 1
-2 999 871: 1
of this person: 1
of five older: 1
then besides harry: 1
killing curse harry: 1
paper attached to: 1
not harry swallowed: 1
last time i: 1
of his lips: 1
your head saying: 1
know how to: 1
to be afraid: 1
that mattered and: 1
now you have: 1
mechanical paper harry: 1
threat would this: 1
or the sort: 1
was inscribed in: 1
it's just um: 1
very low to: 1
bad guess -20: 1
- look at: 1
his wand what: 1
from them neville: 1
you're slower than: 1
hurt me said: 1
the dorm eating: 1
you three points: 1
frowned that's odd: 1
and produce each: 1
realized that only: 1
this game controller: 1
had not been: 1
meal bars nothing: 1
gave him a: 1
anyone would suspect: 1
that ended abruptly: 1
things don't always: 1
said points for: 1
be surrounding another: 1
to sleep in: 1
was only when: 1
conversation was supposed: 1
the message there: 1
over a group: 1
guess very bad: 1
he wasn't sure: 1
growled the largest: 1
his hand face: 1
of stairs to: 1
perfectly regular hence: 1
of accidental magic: 1
drawing a complete: 1
papers scattered around: 1
last night until: 1
probably not quite: 1
the heck am: 1
the answer actually: 1
that slowly the: 1
of them would: 1
control of his: 1
was he supposed: 1
and he didn't: 1
very bad idea: 1
another two times: 1
drayage costs on: 1
few days ago: 1
to three friends: 1
you skip the: 1
if it is: 1
the ever-changing maze: 1
by i forget: 1
turn up the: 1
but now he'd: 1
hadn't gotten to: 1
reached up to: 1
of paper telling: 1
draco's curse came: 1
note at the: 1
you grabbed me: 1
points from slytherin: 1
might want to: 1
a problem i: 1
ran around his: 1
gain you future: 1
accepting his anger: 1
and now i: 1
his growing legend: 1
a lifetime this: 1
a brief pause: 1
cave-in only the: 1
me to so: 1
inscribed in the: 1
mcgonagall's transfiguration class: 1
another piece of: 1
well once the: 1
reflected some sort: 1
her office he: 1
he looked around: 1
a thought occurred: 1
to tell himself: 1
of that intersection: 1
with his mokeskin: 1
to ask the: 1
eleven-year-old boy though: 1
about you go: 1
you'll be at: 1
slowly i mean: 1
flipped it over: 1
had let him: 1
she pointed an: 1
written this and: 1
he had definitely: 1
sky backup plan: 1
a nice little: 1
it was ever: 1
it harry shut: 1
vision he saw: 1
of the titles: 1
two pies then: 1
a pie there: 1
eyed harry appraisingly: 1
harry hate the: 1
the objective of: 1
enough to do: 1
message there might: 1
lost points for: 1
over with a: 1
the game instructions: 1
and a horribly: 1
a rather skeptical: 1
me please play: 1
years - harry: 1
have been surprised: 1
harry put this: 1
felt smaller than: 1
you heard of: 1
that felt like: 1
widdle books -: 1
after this whole: 1
he just snapped: 1
wouldn't move around: 1
out the cabinet: 1
this be exactly: 1
or something i: 1
threats first a: 1
hogwarts in herbology: 1
a loss on: 1
harry's brain was: 1
said attempt failed: 1
suppose i could: 1
trouble especially if: 1
the only real: 1
both pluses and: 1
that showed dragons: 1
his face looking: 1
the boys did: 1
bars - not: 1
twenty-two minutes ago: 1
wakening in him: 1
well wherever i: 1
surreal until you: 1
his index finger: 1
second thought no: 1
a game i'm: 1
help me or: 1
and his imagination: 1
never get angry: 1
walls and ceiling: 1
hogwarts this is: 1
whether he'd won: 1
granger in first-year: 1
walk straight through: 1
neck and chest: 1
so scared it: 1
missing breakfast i: 1
to admit that: 1
vision as he: 1
since you do: 1
walk straight out: 1
harry potter and: 1
got my wand: 1
pie this one: 1
his best lethal: 1
actually broken my: 1
fine young raven: 1

sprout it was: 1
helplessly and then: 1
went out the: 1

the rules plainly: 1
lifted his other: 1
you - raised: 1
made of quite: 1
synchronize his 26-hour: 1
him rather skeptically: 1
crime or covert: 1

slytherins who seemed: 1
boys as soon: 1
harry became aware: 1
of the slytherin: 1
raised her eyebrows: 1
i'm sorry harry: 1
-3 000 000: 1
he could have: 1
dressed and then: 1
you are a: 1
to take dictation: 1
instead the old: 1
trying to tell: 1

angle his quieter: 1
seriously stomping the: 1
snack bars expecting: 1
she frowned that's: 1
young hufflepuffs i: 1
rooms and mcgonagall's: 1
wouldn't be told: 1
points 97 you: 1
harry turned around: 1
at the instructions: 1
my wand out: 1
conscious intervention or: 1
another hint how: 1
was turned off: 1
the boy stumbling: 1
universe in which: 1
me that i: 1
upon a fiery: 1
he said slowly: 1
not know how: 1
afraid of -: 1
world of trouble: 1
window and see: 1
that belled forth: 1
like a very: 1
slytherin staggered back: 1
world for one: 1
out in advance: 1
and harry froze: 1
strange look you: 1
grabbed him i: 1
fourth move and: 1
of thing and: 1
irreplaceable opportunity recognition: 1
will gain you: 1
maximum and his: 1
of witnesses their: 1
this is it: 1
i perceive young: 1
of a lecture: 1
harry's eyes dropped: 1
protect and i: 1
penalty and now: 1
control here how: 1
remember ever being: 1
said a hint: 1
empty air i: 1
person harry said: 1
admit that the: 1
point he knew: 1
of the pan: 1
to slytherin and: 1
slytherin dungeons at: 1
pie harry observed: 1
the wrist and: 1
me away from: 1
along the hall: 1
to his chest: 1
just you looked: 1
necessary people were: 1
was a quietus: 1
as being really: 1
from a boy: 1
but can you: 1
everyone this story: 1
not eat while: 1
harry brandishing the: 1
be something blocking: 1
all i can: 1
an anecdote you: 1
and more surreal: 1
rather high angle: 1
the part of: 1
of hogwarts was: 1
the slytherin who: 1
at the much: 1
in calm pastoral: 1
it and if: 1
the contestant while: 1
with a wet: 1
how he did: 1
rose up in: 1
a believable accident: 1
chapter it's a: 1
his bed's headboard: 1
not nearly enough: 1
his bed ha: 1
see harry said: 1
existence i didn't: 1
by confusion and: 1
of one to: 1
skeptical look i: 1
points -2 999: 1
forgotten about my: 1
that besides dumbledore: 1
sure he said: 1
darted forward to: 1
turned left into: 1
it and that: 1
i'm asking for: 1
mechanical pencil and: 1
of house hufflepuff: 1
to say it: 1
and that i: 1
and how am: 1
eyes widened really: 1
look of art: 1
that was happening: 1
extra long day: 1
out loud maybe: 1
more points harry: 1
thing he ought: 1
a quietus charm: 1
bed's headboard controlled: 1
is a logical: 1
he said then: 1
pass up the: 1
pies then he: 1
slytherin as it: 1
his pouch er: 1
there was another: 1
it it too: 1
note to myself: 1
me worse than: 1
vanished and she: 1
start laughing but: 1
until then this: 1
message thank you: 1
any permanent damage: 1
the way they: 1
as flinch until: 1
stomp him flat: 1
as she was: 1
read one or: 1
his how dare: 1
is your fourth: 1
was and went: 1
to call it: 1
know harry bowed: 1
make all the: 1
heavy sleeper when: 1
i'm playing -: 1
said then perhaps: 1
harry was suddenly: 1
of magical fix: 1
back to him: 1
provided that the: 1
harry stood in: 1
class at hogwarts: 1
awkward pause no: 1
and on the: 1
blueberry on the: 1
a piece of: 1
be very difficult: 1
had originally climbed: 1
wasn't a long: 1
it is not: 1
the paper harry: 1
of red decorating: 1
in a single: 1
these were much: 1
around while you: 1
not feel like: 1
and then shut: 1
for wearing pajamas: 1
in at a: 1
mokeskin pouch and: 1
got some sort: 1
wrong it was: 1
he'd lost quite: 1
and out the: 1
that i really: 1
said and darted: 1
sort of conscious: 1
distress and storage: 1
for shipping and: 1
of some incredibly: 1
is a monday: 1
neville by the: 1
he would know: 1
balance don't do: 1
were a pack: 1
produced an effect: 1
energy or doing: 1
threatened to notify: 1
harry reached out: 1
went back upstairs: 1
was a message: 1
called for a: 1
a horribly wounded: 1
1am he'd been: 1
don't panic i: 1
like they desperately: 1
hufflepuffs who were: 1
clear that he: 1
castle help me: 1
i doing wait: 1
sort of crime: 1
true a short: 1
without being angry: 1
you seem like: 1
turned forward again: 1
a pack of: 1
up to maximum: 1
not just any: 1
forward again the: 1
you mind if: 1
this one a: 1
on the contestant: 1
the company of: 1
being slow now: 1
rules of the: 1
control of it: 1
eyes dropped deliberately: 1
go of harry's: 1
the rules are: 1
then went out: 1
boy swallowed and: 1
he'd been expecting: 1
looked extremely comfortable: 1
instant was hit: 1
the part where: 1
slytherins his best: 1
turns remaining 1: 1
turns remaining 2: 1
ago the anger: 1
sat up and: 1
harry couldn't trust: 1
set of robes: 1
more surreal until: 1
the one he'd: 1
noted ooh said: 1
this wasn't allowed: 1
out his arm: 1
was rather large: 1
like that harry: 1
- yes yes: 1
reverse the order: 1
to amusement to: 1
still didn't make: 1
earn more points: 1
starting to pick: 1
without getting anywhere: 1
52 am apparently: 1
of thing you: 1
000 000 points: 1
that didn't really: 1
what the rules: 1
he put the: 1
still on them: 1
harry shook it: 1
been expecting that: 1
he got some: 1
go a hint: 1
000 ravenclaw house: 1
room's rubbish bin: 1
and kept on: 1
third try i'm: 1
start over i'm: 1
boys who could: 1
a surprisingly pleasant: 1
who had objected: 1
control somehow he: 1
give you chocolate: 1
to get to: 1
until around 1am: 1
might realize there: 1
heck am i: 1
a strange look: 1
nodded i think: 1
a complete blank: 1
you said for: 1
if he was: 1
points 99 physical: 1
other boy's age: 1
with the group: 1
blank it was: 1
went in search: 1
his headboard facing: 1
your fourth move: 1
away very quickly: 1
what which probably: 1
blocking harry's throat: 1
lips and produce: 1
say to neville: 1
tell his dad: 1
the game bad: 1
give to you: 1
of himself could: 1
whipped his wand: 1
even know the: 1
when you're telling: 1
lungs it might: 1
and that the: 1
each she said: 1
try i'm looking: 1
chance of them: 1
killing curse without: 1
who'd done this: 1
that he wouldn't: 1
in said professor: 1
75 welp harry: 1
a wizened old: 1
smugly i can: 1
first class at: 1
directions but there: 1
then but he: 1
different style as: 1
of a lady: 1
tomorrow but now: 1
from delayed shock: 1
pajamas if the: 1
only a little: 1
said professor mcgonagall's: 1
been allowed to: 1
corridor that ended: 1
- attached to: 1
this time he: 1
he found himself: 1
flight of stairs: 1
class and be: 1
mcgonagall's office wasn't: 1
where the message: 1
finger and it: 1
to apologize humbly: 1
i only got: 1
the complaint about: 1
center of the: 1
motion pushed his: 1
my fine student: 1
out dumbledore he: 1
wand doesn't seem: 1
and he would: 1
from there harry's: 1
advance - some: 1
first day at: 1
that the largest: 1
empty the beds: 1
like probably not: 1
an actual note: 1
that i just: 1
mostly-uneaten chocolate frog: 1
was only silence: 1
crazy enough and: 1
had against him: 1
said promptly and: 1
him furious well: 1
other hand said: 1
spin back around: 1
-1 point current: 1
came from a: 1
worse than anything: 1
stuck down here: 1
are harry put: 1
the surrounding walls: 1
person to survive: 1
around in a: 1
hadn't even begun: 1
unless he was: 1
outside the door: 1
came to an: 1
find the line: 1
priori incantatem said: 1
writing was perfectly: 1
sure he could: 1
one was to: 1
six first-year hufflepuffs: 1
game you're harry: 1
was perfectly regular: 1
ever meddle with: 1
to or something: 1
at it then: 1
don't always turn: 1
nearly came to: 1
him to think: 1
neville had stood: 1
to a whisper: 1
first-year hufflepuffs who: 1
supposed to cut: 1
was exactly what: 1
you are going: 1
i seem to: 1
stared the slytherin: 1
even after rescuing: 1
its own awareness: 1
final desperate and: 1
keeping himself out: 1
before departing for: 1
dictation he had: 1
scourgify sprout said: 1
my student harry: 1
how dare they: 1
that the killing: 1
was suddenly rather: 1
remaining 1 harry: 1
no fewer than: 1
from negative emotions: 1
yet how to: 1
moment i was: 1
would fail and: 1
she turned toward: 1
the center of: 1
harry's field of: 1
dungeons harry had: 1
do something but: 1
trying to hold: 1
squinted at the: 1
his wand out: 1
he definitely didn't: 1
maybe this time: 1
then he pulled: 1
he pretended to: 1
and stronger boys: 1
the problem was: 1
the bottom of: 1
the hand dropped: 1
literally unimaginable a: 1
get dressed and: 1
looked under his: 1
and couldn't pick: 1
bars expecting to: 1
really cool someday: 1
to repeat herself: 1
went he would: 1
have seen his: 1
you're bound to: 1
of control somehow: 1
on well step: 1
thumb against the: 1
to share it: 1
in where i: 1
house hufflepuff would: 1
red wrapping paper: 1
search of the: 1
could stomp him: 1
full day at: 1
there harry's eyes: 1
realize there wasn't: 1
onto the hard: 1
was a pause: 1
harry said again: 1
of harry's finger: 1
as glad as: 1
up could you: 1
know the stakes: 1
quietus charm on: 1
have been used: 1
to not lose: 1
- it wasn't: 1
she has an: 1
shrugged fine professor: 1
under control but: 1
i say only: 1
point penalty for: 1
anger drained away: 1
pie there was: 1
harry said coldly: 1
back his face: 1
pattern here held: 1
of incredibly deep: 1
to professor mcgonagall's: 1
who could stomp: 1
harry stood there: 1
wasn't the best: 1
i see harry: 1
rhetorical effect rather: 1
one minute later: 1
of things to: 1
was a part: 1
boy-who-lived was in: 1
edit don't panic: 1
want to file: 1
right now you're: 1
up late committed: 1
and it is: 1
i wouldn't make: 1
you trying to: 1
skeptically harry sighed: 1
it was when: 1
reality - then: 1
actually neville hissed: 1
name but he: 1
and looked around: 1
slytherin how about: 1
side he was: 1
who'd called for: 1
for a while: 1
the boy-who-lived was: 1
failed failed aiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeee: 1
end the game: 1
up out of: 1
meant neville was: 1
he looked so: 1
the boy-who-lived harry: 1
and in the: 1
sprout cried one: 1
planning to wake: 1
is whispered neville: 1
all farewell harry: 1
attached to his: 1
was a surprisingly: 1
suppose you know: 1
she left walking: 1
but would you: 1
specific hint it's: 1
been inscribed by: 1
young raven where: 1
pulled me away: 1
saw that the: 1
on a pie: 1
there were seven: 1
out toward harry's: 1
the word abracadabra: 1
fear stop said: 1
stride and how: 1
drew her own: 1
instructions the note: 1
the obvious time-saving: 1
face and neck: 1
other side of: 1
of slytherins onto: 1
didn't even realize: 1
the largest boy: 1
intact and made: 1
fellow ravenclaws it's: 1
the same writing: 1
to use it: 1
sprout was maybe: 1
straying eyes had: 1
at school and: 1
have blown up: 1
the hufflepuffs screamed: 1
amusement to delight: 1
wasn't allowed to: 1
charged 30 points: 1
where i was: 1
so harry looked: 1
it was spoken: 1
the bed he: 1
potato was indeed: 1
like to pay: 1
things to never: 1
he ought to: 1
threw it into: 1
bruise here later: 1
abruptly in a: 1
the widdle books: 1
and go left: 1
stop all the: 1
door to her: 1
if you accidentally: 1
really no said: 1
won't say anything: 1
least that was: 1
written in a: 1
you ever meddle: 1
want it yes: 1
er cancel that: 1
hand firmly in: 1
two of the: 1
slowly deliberately reached: 1
friends harry couldn't: 1
take in stride: 1
that might be: 1
boy covered in: 1
breakfast i haven't: 1

by snapping my: 1
threat from an: 1

a rather awkward: 1
right hand harry: 1
rather severe scolding: 1
another pie this: 1
had someone else: 1
swallowed and his: 1
pulled out his: 1
and the slytherins: 1
as if burned: 1
to go over: 1
the slytherins they: 1
may be used: 1
seemed to know: 1
sprint all-out with: 1

bought to take: 1
thought if i: 1
an equally sudden: 1
where you let: 1
wizened old lady: 1
wand and schoolbooks: 1
pencil and mechanical: 1
of them had: 1
she said but: 1
they were done: 1
aware of its: 1
wake up at: 1
harry ran around: 1
back and pick: 1
monday on an: 1
out who'd done: 1
idea hissed the: 1
harry was also: 1
all the action: 1
castle stones all: 1
smaller than he: 1
harry crushed the: 1
didn't have my: 1
can be found: 1
um something the: 1
dorm all of: 1
same motion pushed: 1
they won't tell: 1
harry had absolutely: 1
tactically useful why: 1
rowling omentielvo edit: 1
be other spells: 1
for navigating the: 1
the writing was: 1
froze in place: 1
which was the: 1
do that to: 1
into his pouch: 1
but when you're: 1
scarlet draco's curse: 1
my finger and: 1
trapped was neville: 1
to delight part: 1
had thrown it: 1
she drew her: 1
on that pie: 1
a set of: 1
takes to get: 1
wherever i am: 1
to make itself: 1
harry felt that: 1
looked around expecting: 1
the game harry: 1
you just hate: 1
at a rather: 1
to hogwarts minuses: 1
were helping him: 1
was fun so: 1
on it not: 1
anyone here at: 1
was a sudden: 1
ever say that: 1
i just got: 1
if i was: 1

note was settling: 1
and then there: 1
sack of snails: 1
and read a: 1

stayed up late: 1
points to ravenclaw: 1
ultimately futile search: 1
hands were encased: 1
going to -: 1
to the game: 1

which probably had: 1
dropped more blueberry: 1
game only i: 1
profanity penalty harry: 1
older larger and: 1
the boy they: 1
harry shut his: 1
its own priorities: 1
you i'm cornelion: 1

older slytherins who: 1
harry swallowed this: 1
have happened to: 1
experimental probe ah: 1
his wand but: 1
really bad in: 1
them out harry: 1
one who awards: 1
leaped backward as: 1
covered in pie: 1
no one seemed: 1
over to the: 1
is life and: 1
his claim to: 1
that sometimes the: 1
reached out and: 1
took it out: 1
walked away he: 1
you were the: 1
a mudblood -: 1
been necessary people: 1
all harry shrugged: 1
only real weapon: 1
a general rule: 1
charges drayage costs: 1
then harry caught: 1
harry had an: 1
save you i'm: 1
and said note: 1
an odd-numbered year: 1
you that the: 1
abracadabra and snapped: 1
professor sprout it: 1
that he probably: 1

from behind him: 1
the picture thank: 1
his fingers at: 1
his brain that: 1
be easy enough: 1
a rather severe: 1
explanation for everything: 1
son of a: 1
control it was: 1
the line between: 1
rather skeptically harry: 1
him steadily so: 1
ranged from anger: 1
the corridor to: 1
hufflepuffs who saw: 1
or even imagined: 1
and taking harry's: 1
was gone harry: 1
open and it: 1
middle-aged man in: 1
left walking along: 1
not know who: 1
giggling that idiot: 1
you it was: 1
you have 61: 1

need to go: 1
sign over your: 1

desperately out of: 1
of pretending harry: 1
the rules life: 1
in the company: 1

a move on: 1
green moron so: 1
encased in rubber: 1
points in the: 1
you i wouldn't: 1
mcgonagall's office it: 1
deliberately to neville's: 1
said warning no: 1
for you she: 1
didn't know yet: 1

pencil and he: 1
boy in distress: 1
two moons in: 1
inscribed by a: 1
said note to: 1
to happen grownups: 1
like the right: 1
lock pulled out: 1
said professor sprout: 1
more along the: 1
i think you're: 1
it because it: 1
a bit peculiar: 1
shipping and handling: 1
points is always: 1
know the rules: 1
him the largest: 1
- shut up: 1
opportunity recognition code: 1
game is insane: 1
backward as if: 1
like he'd lost: 1
wearing pajamas pajama: 1
wand out to: 1
in place the: 1
the slytherin dungeons: 1
your wand doesn't: 1
wouldn't make public: 1

hogwarts castle help: 1
pointing with his: 1
itself over him: 1
just read the: 1

could he learn: 1
with fondness she: 1
painting was looking: 1
but reality -: 1
books tighter to: 1
game once in: 1
you yanked me: 1
headboard facing outward: 1
dormitory on the: 1
of his brain: 1
the monsters give: 1
haven't forgotten were: 1
are you doing: 1
calls for them: 1
even if it: 1
about my first: 1
was looking even: 1
- slowly the: 1
hard stone floor: 1
only when he: 1
might be tactically: 1
students he could: 1
wouldn't have been: 1
cooperation of all: 1
in this bloody: 1
and that it's: 1
professor michael verres-evans: 1
a halt what: 1
slytherin who had: 1
harry blinked he'd: 1
dungeons at least: 1
a painting for: 1
the lady eyed: 1
that there is: 1
feel if professor: 1
what it was: 1
mental state confused: 1
his other hand: 1
skeptical about or: 1
looked very interested: 1
for style 10: 1
pauses harry thought: 1
your pajamas you: 1
at this can: 1
young raven aren't: 1
showed you that: 1
went 'hello i'm: 1
as many points: 1
loud a sheet: 1

told me harry: 1
classroom at least: 1
the floor the: 1
ended abruptly in: 1
seen or even: 1
- the head: 1
had worked out: 1

a possible experimental: 1
head and peeled: 1
what do i: 1
this note's for: 1
me trying to: 1
slytherins her eyes: 1
of stairs without: 1
funny seriously that's: 1
he was not: 1
up at the: 1
to pass up: 1
the message originally: 1
bad idea i: 1
there is whispered: 1
had stood looking: 1
through breakfast the: 1
would suspect which: 1
including neville three: 1
robes were the: 1
true how can: 1
but the alarm: 1
the beds rumpled: 1
sprout nodded then: 1
do i get: 1
and pulled me: 1
be an extreme: 1
aiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeee current points: 1
went and started: 1
the figure of: 1
the books unfortunately: 1
a lecture about: 1
to say to: 1
a monday on: 1
told him that: 1
to let that: 1
being a little: 1
million points harry: 1
thinking -3 000: 1
looked as if: 1
how to solve: 1
they desperately wanted: 1
harry stared the: 1
with hermione granger: 1
harry said indignantly: 1
less afraid show: 1
going to ask: 1
any hint i'm: 1
suddenly felt smaller: 1
to get the: 1
call it a: 1

mcgonagall said her: 1

harry a new: 1
that i could: 1

trying to protect: 1
that's enough professor: 1
among them to: 1
harry's eyes he: 1
sighed her wand: 1

gave harry a: 1
wrong it's a: 1
his very best: 1
that is the: 1
fear for whichever: 1
everyone wished for: 1
his hand the: 1
then harry spotted: 1
row of shops: 1
one person than: 1
wall which hollowed: 1
j k rowling: 1
rationalist that is: 1
so what happened: 1
son harry potter: 1
terror and we: 1
their choices for: 1
lord leaving only: 1
voice but i: 1
talk to me: 1
more than wands: 1
eyes as well: 1
step is to: 1
potter tears were: 1
made a noise: 1
him mr potter: 1
what nothing mr: 1
shoulder don't pester: 1
hoping that someone: 1
admirable loyalty said: 1

and that i: 1
not until you're: 1
k rowling asks: 1
a little bit: 1
don't get me: 1
a small small: 1
whether out of: 1
a moment that: 1
that story and: 1
and struck the: 1
even as he: 1
a wrinkled hand: 1
instead who was: 1
of you mcgonagall: 1
been told about: 1
the word and: 1
you should have: 1
hands and not: 1
of three diffusion: 1
of confusion a: 1
of one person: 1
it mcgonagall gave: 1
whispered it should: 1
an odd glance: 1
you never know: 1
- may have: 1
and the death: 1
i - could: 1
mcgonagall her voice: 1
terrible and they: 1
how your parents: 1
start it made: 1
where it ended: 1
hollow said mcgonagall: 1
rule that whenever: 1
anger or maybe: 1
know nothing i: 1
slammed her foot: 1
i forgot for: 1
the burnt hulk: 1
he looked up: 1
and in his: 1
at the soul: 1
said once they: 1
of james and: 1
newsroom wall that: 1
certain amount of: 1
rubbed his forehead: 1
question remains -: 1
my granson was: 1
you needed to: 1
reason i can't: 1
very well and: 1
why they want: 1
those masked ranks: 1
without any trouble: 1
died harry returned: 1
looked up and: 1
he came in: 1
be rather pointless: 1
them - when: 1
had shown that: 1
professor mcgonagall i: 1
i knew him: 1
year at hogwarts: 1
said in a: 1
that list and: 1
to be there: 1
own any book: 1
lord their peace: 1
is amazingly wise: 1
to feel so: 1
harry potter is: 1
up from her: 1
the man in: 1
to protect itself: 1
were free that: 1
of an advanced: 1
everyone hoping that: 1
could tell you: 1
book you bought: 1
me something strange: 1
she whispered to: 1
curse reflected and: 1
haven't visited before: 1
hand like someone: 1
rowling asks you: 1
and then turned: 1
note of confusion: 1
she hadn't expected: 1
lord said the: 1
suspect you will: 1
the family rule: 1
the next target: 1
were heroes but: 1
like anyone was: 1
chairs with ejection: 1
carefully shook tears: 1
was done sobbing: 1
for school supplies: 1
forgotten about our: 1
was turning into: 1
seats for emergencies: 1
leaky cauldron as: 1
whoever stood out: 1
yet remote spelling: 1
had used up: 1
strongly suspect you: 1
something that made: 1
parents if you: 1
list and those: 1
two fathers there: 1
warningly the glare: 1
as well so: 1
died with their: 1
with a cold: 1
indeed protecting you: 1
the store window: 1
into mcgonagall's robes: 1
happen mcgonagall sighed: 1
have a mum: 1
is when you: 1
and why they: 1
he'd just done: 1
and secrets held: 1
bright and yet: 1
to notice that: 1
if you had: 1
was the pale: 1
something strange clutched: 1
its own any: 1
an old woman: 1
is the most: 1
disguise mcgonagall said: 1
mcgonagall said quietly: 1
and well and: 1
lord's wake and: 1
ought to shake: 1
might want to: 1
will be living: 1
died from which: 1
those people not: 1
crack of doom: 1
it from the: 1
old woman it's: 1
a front of: 1
money for school: 1
of your art: 1
eaters wielded more: 1
of shops with: 1
wrung their hands: 1
experiment which had: 1
into the store: 1
killed lily and: 1
people not really: 1
woman it's harry: 1
have to go: 1
someone he'd known: 1
you can go: 1
political power and: 1
his body and: 1
seventy-nine thank you: 1
i guess there's: 1
which i strongly: 1
only person ever: 1
blinked then realized: 1
harry spotted something: 1
wished for something: 1
lord voldemort voldemort: 1
little to hear: 1
it is -: 1
what did happen: 1
said sounding a: 1
piercingly bright and: 1
from the body: 1
probably be a: 1
at wounds or: 1
my parents are: 1
always refused to: 1
protect itself an: 1
cauldrons and dragon: 1
her wand tapped: 1
spoons with a: 1
to cower in: 1
skin only his: 1
harry potter what: 1
was no sound: 1
amount of spending: 1
like walking through: 1
diffusion of responsibility: 1
for books could: 1
help if you: 1
sounding a bit: 1
the cycle of: 1
they aren't my: 1

said harry blinked: 1
brilliant books when: 1
your crib he: 1
out the most: 1
aren't my parents: 1
mcgonagall sighed her: 1
of infinite wish: 1
time ago and: 1
tried on me: 1
hesitated to intervene: 1
wands in their: 1
hadn't expected that: 1
i can't have: 1
mcgonagall's eyes as: 1
the pale man: 1
shouldn't ought to: 1
was done and: 1
and strikes directly: 1
rather pointless the: 1
then been separated: 1
my soul whispered: 1
didn't know those: 1
ever to survive: 1
i suppose a: 1
feel so sad: 1
had wrung their: 1
was where it: 1
down just as: 1
something more to: 1
a whisper you: 1
spelling out bigbam's: 1
that someone else: 1
but it is: 1
under control he: 1
the newsroom wall: 1
in fear of: 1
it is a: 1
desperation i didn't: 1
at harry's heart: 1

pure hate and: 1
with a scraping: 1
i have a: 1

at the store: 1
her wand licked: 1
expected that question: 1
me about how: 1
went low though: 1
upon wizarding britain: 1
courtyard he had: 1
you are the: 1
more likely to: 1
that was where: 1
have time for: 1
don't realize that: 1
it wasn't good: 1
walking through the: 1

hurts a little: 1
those two might: 1
and the rest: 1
are most in: 1
and look around: 1
bite and weaken: 1

it hurts a: 1
built up in: 1
tower in which: 1
a disguise mcgonagall: 1
taxes and a: 1
with real flubber: 1
enjoy reading the: 1
long row of: 1

said the bartender: 1
of cushy lounge: 1
regretted their choices: 1
sorry he said: 1
and respected journalist: 1
something perfect that: 1
- could i: 1
voice went low: 1
lord but they: 1
vast bronze doors: 1
did happen mcgonagall: 1
a mum and: 1
is to visit: 1
perhaps she hadn't: 1
confusion a sense: 1
it is him: 1
i'll - have: 1
forward toward the: 1
back to reality: 1
blurred for a: 1
parents are alive: 1
harry's heart what: 1
of spending money: 1
killing curse reflected: 1
and we were: 1
to paralyze a: 1
walk past a: 1
cushy lounge chairs: 1
an old and: 1
hidden but you: 1
done sobbing into: 1
was first among: 1
around the room: 1
say it like: 1
go in and: 1
harry had used: 1
it whoever stood: 1
against the dark: 1
realized what he'd: 1
then realized what: 1
with the inheritance: 1
what an honor: 1
that would turn: 1
as terrible as: 1
until you're ready: 1
snakes to bite: 1
about this he: 1
this year at: 1
was going on: 1
man in the: 1
fiery letters that: 1
harry feeling confused: 1
story very well: 1
did enjoy reading: 1
in and look: 1
could i be: 1
mother at any: 1
any rate -: 1
have to think: 1
in the courtyard: 1
separated from an: 1
at the fabric: 1
that lily and: 1
stuck out a: 1
forehead and why: 1
and stuck out: 1
again and tapped: 1

harry's forehead and: 1
you were more: 1

have to say: 1
potter do you: 1
a cold feeling: 1
oddly found himself: 1
revealing a long: 1
realize that quite: 1
bronze doors gringotts: 1
huge archway revealing: 1
there was wealth: 1
but you survived: 1
ended the killing: 1
the lead to: 1
it wasn't like: 1
that is when: 1
a wilding wolf: 1
have been hidden: 1
that they had: 1
mcgonagall i suppose: 1
walked forward together: 1
an advanced dungeons: 1
very wise not: 1
that plan professor: 1
about this story: 1
school supplies she: 1
for something more: 1
of that list: 1
moment that i: 1
a bit surprised: 1
of his terror: 1
mine harry looked: 1
head kept swiveling: 1
your forehead and: 1
said entirely on: 1
parents left you: 1
bystander effect thought: 1
quietly but your: 1
an anvil of: 1
get me wrong: 1
side i'll -: 1
on harry's shoulder: 1
a lineup of: 1
have been funny: 1
of the terror: 1
that i shouldn't: 1
parents now it: 1
hands my granson: 1
genetic family vault: 1
in which i: 1
were betrayed the: 1
was absurd for: 1
that harry potter: 1
phrase crack of: 1
why people want: 1
is why people: 1
it was absurd: 1
my parents if: 1
on magical subjects: 1
the woman whispered: 1
but the question: 1
before a great: 1
the witch said: 1
bookstore you haven't: 1
to you to: 1
they want to: 1
building with vast: 1
it harry detached: 1
then her wand: 1
inheritance your genetic: 1
likely to get: 1
could be excused: 1
in place we're: 1
question like that: 1
of the wizarding: 1
death eaters had: 1
him harry rubbed: 1
refused to talk: 1
harry thinking of: 1
want to hold: 1
the terror and: 1
a steady look: 1
perfectly utterly normal: 1
to think about: 1
that this doesn't: 1
to intimidate anyone: 1
lineup of cushy: 1
not cry again: 1
first step is: 1
want to miss: 1
glance mr potter: 1
his voice under: 1
the end of: 1
to the skins: 1
utterly normal they: 1
an admirable loyalty: 1
burnt hulk of: 1
the only defense: 1
dark arts this: 1
first among them: 1
wasn't the name: 1
enough to intimidate: 1
clasped hands my: 1
end of the: 1
you harry potter: 1
but he did: 1
and he came: 1
his head kept: 1
storm of weeping: 1
money for books: 1
welcome harry said: 1
real flubber and: 1
pointless the witch: 1
pending discussion mcgonagall: 1
bar with the: 1
bricks with bronze-metal: 1
for the many: 1
the next example: 1
itself off his: 1
and lily potter: 1
sobbing into mcgonagall's: 1
had meant to: 1
going on but: 1
onto their clasped: 1
mcgonagall said sounding: 1
like someone he'd: 1
and the tower: 1
very perceptive most: 1

and somewhere in: 1
is him quavered: 1
green and a: 1
world your genetic: 1
rallied well yes: 1
then rallied well: 1
the bank of: 1
most likely to: 1
harry is this: 1
harry's shoulder don't: 1
didn't want to: 1
had an infant: 1
my imagination that: 1
the names of: 1
the strangest feeling: 1
granson was an: 1
fabric of their: 1
a time hogwarts: 1
and shot mcgonagall: 1
something of a: 1
emergencies harry's head: 1
their clasped hands: 1
potter thank heavens: 1
up all his: 1
suppose a certain: 1
small voice but: 1
said so that: 1
harry gestured at: 1
many and the: 1
simple fear for: 1
books could be: 1
through the magical: 1
ruthlessness diamond clarity: 1
the old bartender: 1
their everyday lives: 1
this be -: 1
- maybe -: 1
didn't play the: 1
wall that next: 1
wands there was: 1
there with the: 1
to the newsroom: 1
entirely on automatic: 1
terms like you-know-who: 1
right in front: 1
a duplicate harry: 1
a great distraction: 1
defense is not: 1
got up from: 1
diamond clarity a: 1
pale man the: 1
out again and: 1
only when mcgonagall: 1
'genetic parents' or: 1
voice that sounded: 1
whispered the old: 1
hurry said mcgonagall: 1
that gave harry: 1
darley's experiment which: 1
witch said tightly: 1
cold feeling ruthlessness: 1
use safer terms: 1
tears fell from: 1
and he killed: 1
directly at the: 1
like that lily: 1
most in need: 1
item for sale: 1
oppose the dark: 1
broad-ranging library of: 1
his vision blurred: 1
eyes he wiped: 1
a sad rule: 1
just make myself: 1

cry again he: 1
not have time: 1
you protecting me: 1
harry potter tears: 1
voldemort harry whispered: 1
wounds or snakes: 1
art to notice: 1
people don't realize: 1

just as the: 1
rotating rotating like: 1
he-who-must-not-be-named the dark: 1
when you walk: 1
ahead and call: 1
until the names: 1
no sound from: 1

two might have: 1
harry potter with: 1
lily potter rose: 1
that shone piercingly: 1
distracted for it: 1

harry said his: 1
look mcgonagall slammed: 1
at hogwarts i: 1

mcgonagall said so: 1
most people don't: 1
hogwarts has quite: 1

of his eyebrows: 1
your forehead that: 1
mcgonagall stepped right: 1
if j k: 1
visited before you: 1
absurd for the: 1
low though it: 1
a cat and: 1
everyone froze in: 1
the many to: 1
them to oppose: 1
in mcgonagall's eyes: 1
selfishness or simple: 1
would be the: 1
mcgonagall gave him: 1
your mother at: 1
though you might: 1
a brick wall: 1
he ever had: 1
shot around the: 1
fear of the: 1

mcgonagall slammed her: 1
for emergencies harry's: 1
art as a: 1

perfect that i: 1
man the man: 1
swept over harry: 1
your hand the: 1
that i was: 1
an auror she: 1
which displayed fiery: 1
wise not to: 1
shivered into a: 1
magical items section: 1
to your crib: 1
of blue bricks: 1
stepped right in: 1
wolf tearing and: 1
may have been: 1

rebounded and struck: 1
his eyebrows a: 1
you'll need money: 1
tapped three times: 1
and i know: 1

the bystander effect: 1
of his wife: 1

said warningly the: 1
as the general: 1
and shivered into: 1
store a front: 1
again not until: 1
comparing that reality: 1
clarity a hammer: 1
a more broad-ranging: 1
to reality only: 1
all his tears: 1
to complete the: 1
up and felt: 1
thank you harry: 1

of latane and: 1
burned with a: 1
kept rotating rotating: 1
skins of his: 1

mr potter our: 1
resolved then and: 1
that made him: 1
chair doris -: 1

woman whispered she: 1
it was trying: 1
epileptic fit in: 1
a certain flaw: 1
terrible as the: 1
tapped harry's forehead: 1
looked at green: 1
himself from mcgonagall's: 1
for increased taxes: 1
what was going: 1
thought harry thinking: 1
body it cannot: 1

we were free: 1
end to you: 1
your genetic family: 1
apathetic selfishness or: 1
in their hands: 1
vanguard carrion vultures: 1

sighed and i: 1
the rulebooks harry: 1
head kept rotating: 1
in need of: 1
ravenclaw thing i: 1
up to somewhere: 1
have been very: 1
they came before: 1
death eaters wielded: 1
strikes directly at: 1
dungeons and dragons: 1
better to see: 1
ever heard what: 1
shot mcgonagall a: 1
together into the: 1
go ahead and: 1
like you-know-who the: 1
names of james: 1
the soul severing: 1
together in silence: 1
in the back: 1
the end to: 1
amazingly wise of: 1
a society trying: 1
rest of it: 1
pointless to feel: 1
to hear you: 1
how much have: 1
james and he: 1
as best he: 1
on but oddly: 1
as his head: 1
when you are: 1
front of blue: 1
a long row: 1
her foot down: 1
lily and james: 1
when mcgonagall stepped: 1
he pronounced the: 1
his mind was: 1
died in seventy-nine: 1
that i'd just: 1
but don't think: 1
never know -: 1
him entirely without: 1
said her hand: 1
head and shot: 1
and there to: 1
as well though: 1
on me but: 1
around that's the: 1
she said harry: 1
there was no: 1
front of one: 1
of weeping that: 1
would be pointless: 1
only his skin: 1
into the wizarding: 1
said mcgonagall her: 1
gestured at the: 1
person than in: 1
you will be: 1
you been told: 1
and they always: 1
and dilated and: 1
best distraction anyone: 1
is this -: 1
for this good: 1
- that's enough: 1
rose to the: 1
feeling that i: 1
harry rubbed his: 1
i be -: 1
complete the cycle: 1
well and they: 1
anvil of yielding: 1
he was done: 1
hand which harry: 1
with the twitching: 1
and weaken the: 1
whisper you should: 1
he killed lily: 1
and they were: 1
next to the: 1
lord killed james: 1
he shouted that: 1
the storm of: 1
like that deserved: 1
or simple fear: 1
in blissful ignorance: 1
were in the: 1
somewhere around the: 1
pick at wounds: 1
with signs advertising: 1
propose it whoever: 1
of mine harry: 1
potter is why: 1
library of its: 1
livers harry didn't: 1
very best am: 1
a large library: 1
make myself unhappy: 1
came in the: 1
and dad and: 1
fit in front: 1
i didn't know: 1
gave him an: 1
of it mcgonagall: 1
asking an entirely: 1
bartender harry potter: 1
were goggles that: 1
but oddly found: 1
and dragon livers: 1
would go first: 1
for the phrase: 1
my family harry: 1
happened harry said: 1
part of harry's: 1
advanced dungeons and: 1
the tower in: 1
not to be: 1
very well indeed: 1
been very wise: 1
the back of: 1
him an odd: 1
rate - may: 1
not to tell: 1
toward the bar: 1
street could tell: 1
to keep his: 1
i've forgotten about: 1
quite so quickly: 1
rending at the: 1

tom he's new: 1
known a long: 1
if it is: 1
death eaters were: 1
tightened on harry's: 1
you to your: 1
thinking veer off: 1
reality to something: 1
had been found: 1
who was the: 1
suddenly ashamed i'm: 1
this doesn't happen: 1
an infant child: 1
to me about: 1
severing it from: 1
yes you're very: 1
enough professor mcgonagall: 1
sad rule that: 1
sense of something: 1
it was like: 1
you instead of: 1
and political power: 1
potter with a: 1
harry detached himself: 1
harry said entirely: 1
duplicate harry nodded: 1
of the three: 1
them away in: 1
more uncomfortable than: 1
so you wish: 1
mcgonagall and start: 1
mcgonagall and they: 1
friends of mine: 1
strangest feeling that: 1
was an auror: 1
now would probably: 1
came before a: 1
safer terms like: 1
his life carefully: 1
quickly - that's: 1
feeling a sense: 1
from which i: 1
- can this: 1
godric's hollow said: 1
forehead and that: 1
doris - mcgonagall: 1
shoes um you: 1
trouble mcgonagall harry: 1
steady look my: 1
coming into harry's: 1
though it came: 1
now it would: 1

harry said as: 1
so that this: 1
mum and dad: 1
wizarding britain like: 1
was one of: 1
people want to: 1
of he-who-must-not-be-named the: 1
ask what was: 1
reflected and rebounded: 1
that quite so: 1
and call them: 1
he could not: 1
is there with: 1
be pointless to: 1
- when harry: 1
three you needed: 1
told him of: 1
was trying to: 1
my genetic parents: 1
distraction anyone has: 1
his terror the: 1
look around that's: 1
tell you so: 1
and that was: 1
james and lily: 1
left you and: 1
much have you: 1
unhappy by comparing: 1
that i knew: 1

you had an: 1
but for that: 1
pester the boy: 1
you bought now: 1
mr potter she: 1
do you know: 1

her voice went: 1
this but it: 1
bit surprised perhaps: 1
an entirely different: 1
of my family: 1
vultures to pick: 1
i have ever: 1
found himself asking: 1
everyday lives other: 1
the rest of: 1
turning into a: 1
done and no: 1
foot down just: 1
tiny note but: 1
but your genetic: 1
mcgonagall sighed your: 1
that whenever you: 1

in a voice: 1
magical subjects and: 1
harry's head kept: 1
her chair doris: 1
robes he looked: 1
your parents -: 1
it's harry potter: 1
different question instead: 1
he resolved then: 1
parents - or: 1
would be rather: 1
a chill swept: 1
cycle of infinite: 1
heading straight into: 1
of pure hate: 1
he cast the: 1
knew him harry: 1
funny but it: 1
loss and the: 1
to say 'genetic: 1
hulk of his: 1
subjects and the: 1
were terrible and: 1
blissful ignorance there: 1
to hold off: 1
it cannot be: 1
you have to: 1
within those masked: 1
i strongly suspect: 1
to see the: 1
and a scar: 1
ejection seats for: 1

the few his: 1
would turn anything: 1
you walk past: 1
brick wall which: 1
killed james and: 1
myself unhappy by: 1
you know nothing: 1
to miss a: 1
surprised perhaps she: 1
so sad for: 1
than wands there: 1
the tips of: 1

i shouldn't ought: 1
has ever tried: 1
then turned his: 1

an honor harry: 1
to go in: 1
with their wands: 1
i only want: 1
in the dark: 1
not really they: 1

he'll be teaching: 1
he did enjoy: 1
soul severing it: 1
certain flaw in: 1
family rule that: 1
flubber and knives: 1
had followed in: 1
flaw in that: 1
to see tears: 1
professor quirrell he'll: 1

there is a: 1
this story you: 1
mcgonagall said warningly: 1
a hammer of: 1
really they aren't: 1

spotted something that: 1
story you know: 1
small note of: 1
something wrong about: 1

thing i have: 1
on this story: 1
their wands already: 1
i cannot guess: 1
to vengeance but: 1
vendor pretty clever: 1
his back on: 1

of his life: 1
chuckled grimly i: 1
into a sitting: 1
scared but determined: 1
instant harry tried: 1

world whose problems: 1
that his first: 1
the ministry's proposed: 1
right draco's working: 1
sounding tired the: 1
i cannot say: 1

malfoy did the: 1
forgetting how to: 1
there letting the: 1
it until afterward: 1

my own age: 1
keep them controlled: 1
around him and: 1
true - harry: 1

irrelevant lucius he: 1
upon his cane: 1

hiss of disapproval: 1
and the quibbler: 1
sound-blurring barrier what: 1
and harry read: 1
approve of she: 1
was just reading: 1

forward by the: 1
were wizards after: 1
pretty clever disguise: 1
if i had: 1

over to one: 1
unavoidable harry said: 1
and he unfolded: 1
besides if the: 1
his voice cold: 1
moment the quieting: 1
a hiss of: 1
platform he took: 1
him their eyes: 1
over to the: 1
request this harridan: 1
i think not: 1
harry claimed that: 1

your head before: 1
her dismissively and: 1
lethargic than anything: 1

white-haired man and: 1
the death eaters: 1
hell what did: 1
of my abilities: 1

in the morning: 1
in the muggle: 1
fundamental question of: 1
the smart thing: 1
her voice lowered: 1
steel into his: 1
he was leaving: 1
cannot but expect: 1
have you the: 1
9 75 the: 1
any of that: 1
of my game: 1

dumbledore's and that: 1
being an annoyance: 1
me at which: 1
- company said: 1
then let out: 1

more of me: 1
father thinks you're: 1
returned the woman: 1
games with my: 1

just that his: 1
for the unavoidable: 1
a thin trace: 1
after all after: 1

he'd seen before: 1
on neville's forehead: 1
her voice took: 1
might be some: 1
i read my: 1
to occupy his: 1
see them warning: 1
it's free said: 1
part of king's: 1
time you were: 1
fold of the: 1
just pretending to: 1
and not just: 1
voice stopped in: 1
fingers and he: 1
table he'd sat: 1
lucius straightened and: 1
such a fool: 1
to him today: 1
friendly act and: 1
harry said innocently: 1
it can't be: 1
if there was: 1
was approaching looking: 1
how dare you: 1
to you in: 1
the vendor pretty: 1
distant from the: 1
was greatly appreciated: 1
try to fix: 1
to make sure: 1
i wish you: 1
obvious that you: 1
he stood there: 1
own age there: 1
inside of your: 1
did the speech: 1
scared at all: 1
all the changes: 1
that about harry: 1
- ignore him: 1
the white-haired man: 1
you say to: 1
any case mr: 1
up it doesn't: 1
for you to: 1
air bright the: 1
a friendly act: 1
outraged madam longbottom: 1
to show his: 1
the headline he'd: 1
hand now how: 1
i just want: 1
there was nothing: 1
draco that i: 1
it scared him: 1
from the newspaper: 1
let them believe: 1
off to read: 1
i was puzzled: 1
a fool as: 1
and i wondered: 1
and vanished like: 1
luck in your: 1
advisement harry said: 1
swirled around him: 1
they'd be very: 1
ministry's proposed marriage: 1
peace of this: 1
high a pitch: 1
face before realizing: 1
would trespass on: 1
warning the author's: 1
the other possibilities: 1
foremost among their: 1
the instruction addressed: 1
that same cane: 1
of the other: 1
stowed away his: 1
of your comment: 1
were merely lucius's: 1
imperius young man: 1
stared at harry: 1
the ancient greek: 1
update for a: 1
you get a: 1
last worthwhile thing: 1
nothing in the: 1
as he turned: 1
ask nothing more: 1
not a friendly: 1
didn't even know: 1
the obvious craziness: 1
suddenly hardening if: 1
of dumbledore's plans: 1
of them harry: 1
mr malfoy did: 1
enough slander of: 1
dumbledore's bidding in: 1
nametag just an: 1
she really was: 1
harry was just: 1
same newsstand from: 1
picture of the: 1
was in her: 1
complexity so harry: 1
going on so: 1
that possibility from: 1
wait outside in: 1
decided that she: 1
hanging low in: 1
must all be: 1
what comes out: 1
was expressionless two: 1
train station anyway: 1
said putting steel: 1
and bright their: 1
if my suspicions: 1
- no harry: 1
took me days: 1
he unfolded it: 1
out a hiss: 1
with you directly: 1
fear you are: 1
he'd prepared to: 1
harm i wish: 1
lucius raised his: 1
with my son: 1
you to go: 1
stuff you said: 1
harry had no: 1
to go granma: 1
man was still: 1
response to professor: 1
who didn't look: 1
of your head: 1
yes draco malfoy: 1
pavement you have: 1
of that was: 1
possibility from all: 1
all the other: 1
and that is: 1
fire' and they: 1
and now do: 1
young man said: 1
said thermos the: 1
your pose then: 1
anyway - i: 1
bubble the two: 1
think i think: 1
real news in: 1
not me said: 1
students and bright: 1
my second quibbler: 1
then harry's voice: 1
pale haze vanished: 1
all sounds went: 1
in your own: 1
all if any: 1
they've even got: 1
said harry in: 1
that important if: 1
and no work: 1
not all of: 1
on it i: 1
from last time: 1
posted bright the: 1
you off said: 1
hissed lucius's dark: 1
speech given by: 1
occasional muffled cracks: 1
chuckle i shall: 1
said calmly dumbledore: 1
he couldn't help: 1
of right not: 1
you then the: 1
sat quietly for: 1
i will say: 1

that ill-fated adventurer: 1
giggling to herself: 1
winter things for: 1

down into harry's: 1
public train station: 1
never heard draco: 1
now do you: 1
at him just: 1
the main crowd: 1
had no idea: 1

the sky at: 1
suppressed news and: 1
said with malicious: 1
harry had moved: 1
even got a: 1
popped and vanished: 1
more lethargic than: 1
near harry he: 1
whose interest was: 1
low in the: 1
the air bright: 1
how strangely does: 1
confused and frightened: 1
asked themselves 'wait: 1

to that and: 1
newspaper there might: 1
slugs of scotch: 1
the daily prophet: 1

prepared to board: 1
his hands it's: 1
he is my: 1
longbottom said the: 1
not truly consent: 1
counter one copy: 1
what he said: 1
until afterward hence: 1
sent a shock: 1
your purpose in: 1
harry in a: 1
humble opinion his: 1
barrier what did: 1
carrying that same: 1
be just as: 1
pettigrew were secretly: 1

of guilt for: 1

already gripped low: 1
i mean -: 1
let lucius see: 1
my friend and: 1

and frightened i: 1
sound like one: 1
work of dumbledore's: 1
and they were: 1
ancient greek philosophers: 1
robes swirled around: 1
approves of right: 1
just reading about: 1
read my second: 1
of complexity so: 1
your opinion under: 1
shrugged helplessly then: 1
all madam longbottom: 1
potter's loyal lieutenant: 1
gripped low in: 1

that could pose: 1
that i was: 1
a true quieting: 1
house malfoy that's: 1
comment on it: 1
but then it: 1
wands already gripped: 1
what he needed: 1

of chaos how: 1
just an amazing: 1
it by accident: 1
changed as he: 1
way of thinking: 1
is what comes: 1
was insane and: 1
' they didn't: 1

a minute later: 1
wish you the: 1
three pops of: 1
but expect me: 1
luna lovegood was: 1
it must all: 1

human after all: 1
muffled cracks of: 1
and using a: 1
a dry voice: 1
platform 9 3: 1
his fear to: 1

vanished like a: 1
fine on my: 1
man and chuckled: 1
i say to: 1

the world that: 1
you her voice: 1
days to understand: 1
harry whatever you: 1
author's notes the: 1
effective upon the: 1
you directly without: 1
of his trunk: 1
eyes glittered at: 1
could imagine evidence: 1
copy of the: 1
when the next: 1
woman who didn't: 1
dearly hope that: 1
coat opened a: 1
a silver snake's: 1
4 vanished i: 1
was that in: 1
head courteously sending: 1
news and besides: 1
and read the: 1
the gaze and: 1
course said lucius: 1
stood there letting: 1
but i would: 1
harry read on: 1
and struck it: 1
innocently i just: 1
scar harry potter: 1
fix all the: 1
like harry took: 1
had except through: 1
- and then: 1
man thank you: 1
seen before the: 1
lucius seemed strangely: 1
how do i: 1
you have wrought: 1
for its handle: 1
grimly i was: 1
mistake my interests: 1
the air and: 1
with four knuts: 1
crowd and the: 1
lucius's dark robes: 1
meet you i: 1
who it is: 1
until 10 55am: 1
can't be easy: 1
malfoy manor there: 1
fifty-four years long: 1
finally became clear: 1
would be mr: 1
quibbler to see: 1
for disturbing you: 1
been judging by: 1
demurred and he: 1
two men flanked: 1
his shoulders the: 1
pause so you: 1
me harry said: 1
drew his wand: 1
that is precisely: 1
the sounds of: 1
would not have: 1
you know draco: 1
using a true: 1
give my life: 1
cold but perhaps: 1
peter pettigrew were: 1
you i have: 1
from the main: 1
without draco's knowledge: 1
and wait outside: 1
harry found a: 1
said harry still: 1
lucius malfoy harry: 1
white-haired head shifted: 1
harry i'll see: 1
rather think not: 1
then said the: 1
iron chair somewhere: 1
but harry and: 1
was anything i: 1
afterward hence the: 1
look half that: 1
stuff up -: 1
after all when: 1
turn sometimes i: 1
the only competing: 1
lucius said icily: 1
quibbler was the: 1
i rather think: 1
if it contained: 1
the newspaper and: 1
do you know: 1
let out a: 1
a threat to: 1
sheer shock then: 1
there was anything: 1
easy to make: 1
cavern you know: 1
the opposite of: 1
ice are you: 1
goin' ter be: 1
lucius now sounding: 1
know harry said: 1
letting the january: 1
i find it: 1
corrupting you draco: 1
nothing lucius raised: 1
believe that i: 1
man's face suddenly: 1
pose then said: 1
amazing imitation -: 1
to professor quirrell's: 1
ways if not: 1
i bear though: 1
girl oh harry: 1
very important that: 1
ground of platform: 1
go really wrong: 1
his first week: 1
and popped and: 1
of his trunk's: 1
on and finally: 1
parents he'd only: 1
opened a compartment: 1
and the boy-who-lived: 1
good idea to: 1
half a minute: 1
ban all marriages: 1
it does not: 1
dumbledore's plans which: 1
his trunk's cavern: 1
just an instant: 1
same nearby table: 1
neville he must: 1
to read his: 1
her hand now: 1
looked very worried: 1
chapter will vanish: 1
is my heart: 1
is precisely what: 1
slander of my: 1
75 the winter: 1
no work of: 1
if they'd been: 1
9 3 4: 1
for this chapter: 1
into harry's trunk: 1
are true you: 1
time around slytherins: 1
must spend the: 1
conclusion of his: 1
just making stuff: 1
i decided that: 1
said to him: 1
that not being: 1
newspaper and said: 1
trunk and stowed: 1
charm and not: 1
was that about: 1
spirit of friendship: 1
interest was being: 1
be threatening me: 1
appendages as certainly: 1
ordinary people try: 1
fiction this morning: 1
voice sounded a: 1
oh no worries: 1
imagine evidence they'd: 1
the inside of: 1
addressed to harry: 1
as harry approached: 1
that he could: 1
what was your: 1
them controlled but: 1
if everything is: 1
nearby table he'd: 1
his cane a: 1
lord could hardly: 1
is that your: 1
well that wouldn't: 1
the world turn: 1
have thought that: 1
whatever you said: 1
and i'm secretly: 1
be the senior: 1
you are weak: 1
into his own: 1
a single organism: 1
neville looked confused: 1
our friendship please: 1
death eaters still: 1
come out like: 1
expressionless two men: 1
yawned and stretched: 1
heaven help them: 1
5th 1992 some: 1
part with four: 1
warnings on this: 1
so it's very: 1
to scare father: 1
professor quirrell cost: 1
flowed through him: 1
to try to: 1
themselves if they: 1
and how do: 1
and the occasional: 1
minute later you: 1
semi-collapsed into a: 1
vendor said amiably: 1
to support that: 1
said innocently i: 1
vanished showing an: 1
him just to: 1
chapter is posted: 1
he'd sat down: 1
mark i bear: 1
chair somewhere else: 1
on his face: 1
tensed some instinct: 1
is part of: 1
which said harry: 1
took on a: 1
their children and: 1
i'm betrothed to: 1
my friends what: 1
their number and: 1
to fix all: 1
shock then -: 1
there might be: 1
left foot i: 1
play along a: 1
what i can: 1
away if there: 1
on gosh harry: 1
contained any suppressed: 1
black and luna: 1
which but then: 1
it is the: 1
'all is fire': 1
what his normal: 1
turned then let: 1
all finally became: 1
to board this: 1
first his voice: 1
through him and: 1
wedding said the: 1
all be mad: 1
seemed not in: 1
know i heard: 1
of some but: 1
truly consent it: 1
lucius see that: 1
grey eyes suddenly: 1
shriek in horror: 1
this his face: 1
lucius inclined his: 1
good friend my: 1
among pureblood families: 1
go granma said: 1
the quieting charm: 1
not know it: 1
ground the world: 1
the next chapter: 1
moved away from: 1
both those hands: 1
father i don't: 1
a sense -: 1
blurted draco the: 1
professor quirrell's little: 1
without the support: 1
and chuckled grimly: 1
own voice that: 1
would give my: 1
to be concerned: 1
shoulders the man: 1
was something completely: 1
hence the false: 1
as you have: 1
if the quibbler: 1
my pen name: 1
which point exactly: 1
saying things like: 1
indeed said harry: 1
the vendor started: 1
hogwarts had been: 1
had insisted on: 1
in harry's humble: 1
wore their robes: 1
in any case: 1
cane lacquered in: 1
finally harry drew: 1
though since i: 1
clever disguise innit: 1
i shall play: 1
not have answered: 1
spills all sorts: 1
eaters did not: 1
the senior goyle: 1
except through draco: 1
doubt it is: 1
was foremost among: 1
before he dropped: 1
a gloating tone: 1
oh harry said: 1
said harry so: 1
interest it took: 1
speech said the: 1
main crowd and: 1
face was expressionless: 1
from moving forward: 1
of the parents: 1
throat as he: 1
she couldn't be: 1
dumbledore intercepted them: 1
a sitting position: 1
answered them if: 1
is water' or: 1
groaned but said: 1
he could be: 1
lightly that's obvious: 1
on january 5th: 1
must be mad: 1
a poor mood: 1
on a gloating: 1
quirrell cost you: 1
potter there was: 1
to make this: 1
moving forward by: 1
precisely what i: 1
help was greatly: 1
something's got to: 1
- it's okay: 1
lucius his face: 1
be my only: 1
amiably and i'm: 1
gasped the vendor: 1
foot i apologize: 1
had suddenly tensed: 1
i let them: 1
harry eyes dipping: 1
your good friend: 1
in a poor: 1
going to try: 1
going down into: 1
quibbler could top: 1
chaos how strangely: 1
at the conclusion: 1
he didn't know: 1
that's obvious right: 1
yes that does: 1
harry's voice stopped: 1
this harridan to: 1
poor mood mr: 1
up from the: 1
a little what: 1
draco and no: 1
any new threads: 1
is 'what do: 1
ordinary people four: 1
showed sheer shock: 1
this whole time: 1
to make stuff: 1
said one of: 1
that was too: 1
think it must: 1
vanished in a: 1
feeling more lethargic: 1
thought that sirius: 1
strange games with: 1
voice took on: 1
said half a: 1
instead of coming: 1
do neville groaned: 1
had been judging: 1
that you think: 1
up you couldn't: 1
threads of complexity: 1
doing draco harm: 1
neville there was: 1
still need to: 1
cold tell me: 1
the list of: 1
the support of: 1
the theory wasn't: 1
wouldn't be hard: 1
his wand and: 1
the world whose: 1
tone you seem: 1
longbottom neville self-styled: 1
i could benefit: 1
suppressed real news: 1
maneuvering your good: 1
that high a: 1
smashed on six: 1
and stretched feeling: 1
i presume but: 1
shocked could be: 1
45am in the: 1
long needed to: 1
mr malfoy returned: 1
life over to: 1
are weak in: 1
lucius slowly i: 1
and something about: 1
together so we: 1
the speech of: 1
for it seemed: 1
of steel came: 1
on her dismissively: 1
their robes they: 1
were gone a: 1
air and hit: 1
sat at the: 1
it was like: 1
harry met the: 1
with a strange: 1
recruiting among pureblood: 1
friendship if he: 1
10 55am lucius: 1
simply made sure: 1
senior malfoy well: 1
of your testimony: 1
being shocked could: 1
by accident and: 1
it i will: 1
then the pale: 1
changes in my: 1
scanning their wands: 1
rightmost toes on: 1
his grip silently: 1
the rest of: 1
just make stuff: 1
two boys sat: 1
few centimeters and: 1
as my son: 1
six slugs of: 1
draco the moment: 1
just - a: 1
them all if: 1
hermione granger and: 1
of them moved: 1
bright the sun: 1
to see them: 1
look scared at: 1
next chapter is: 1
will you request: 1
draco shriek in: 1
four legs and: 1
so harry found: 1
world turn sometimes: 1
no idea at: 1
a public train: 1
heavens said madam: 1
hard to come: 1
spent too much: 1
darting around despite: 1
some suppressed real: 1
in a pale: 1
did not know: 1
law to ban: 1
neville i think: 1
concerned lucius was: 1
- a newspaper: 1
9 45am in: 1
back to her: 1
with the part: 1
boys sat quietly: 1
hair drifting over: 1
expect me to: 1
at the same: 1
all i will: 1
imitation - and: 1
no clue what: 1
only opportunity to: 1
the counter one: 1
his wizards' robes: 1
suddenly tensed some: 1
be all that: 1
long it was: 1
intimidated they were: 1
in a pleasant: 1
it is that's: 1
was corrupt and: 1
and both those: 1
make him realize: 1
own this time: 1
many changes in: 1
be if he: 1
frivolous to occupy: 1
time wondering if: 1
black and peter: 1
be insane i: 1
smile as harry: 1
you i mean: 1
alliance with that: 1
deal with the: 1
crabbe-and-goyle and harry: 1

armies of the: 1
there was nowhere: 1
nook with a: 1
sunlight touched the: 1
they were just: 1
about your military: 1
she said as: 1
that could scurry: 1
subject anyway are: 1
recipient might feel: 1
the dark lord's: 1
but that would've: 1
it under control: 1
so surely not: 1
have our own: 1
but that wouldn't: 1
you're doing okay: 1
to find the: 1
the thought had: 1
else nope said: 1
black was standing: 1

would appreciate your: 1
first having a: 1
in his hands: 1
quirrell says the: 1
help general granger: 1
her position than: 1
think it'd be: 1
let me rephrase: 1
calm certainty other: 1
will be miserable: 1
kicking up casually: 1
with twenty eyewitnesses: 1
to be ashamed: 1
you scored in: 1
rigors of her: 1
attack evil first: 1
simulate others isn't: 1
leg was that: 1
the great hall: 1
as pushing up: 1
now you're doing: 1
you out immediately: 1
rumor black deliberately: 1
irregularities associated with: 1
really unlikely so: 1
appointing her as: 1
rival she wanted: 1
draco was standing: 1
i expected draco's: 1
said granger sure: 1
good for draco: 1
chance she meant: 1
was pettigrew's animagus: 1
quirrell consider it: 1
and harry she'd: 1
am wounded by: 1
books no fantasy: 1
got the reason: 1
would be hard: 1
defense we have: 1
malfoy at the: 1
thought i'd at: 1
suspect and that: 1
you're getting into: 1
you wanted to: 1
harry sighed i: 1
that maybe not: 1
appointment of hermione: 1
course when they: 1
already signed up: 1
how hard they: 1
with his shoulders: 1
younger self via: 1
at the opposite: 1
you suspect and: 1
killing intention of: 1
as being evil: 1
you it's rude: 1
said hermione right: 1
felt so proud: 1
didn't know the: 1
agree with that: 1
is just asking: 1
ministry schedules were: 1
of her position: 1
water when she'd: 1
lips i suspect: 1
shall be merciful: 1
stood there with: 1
all harry spent: 1
if you want: 1
think about things: 1
him out but: 1
that was his: 1
of soldiers but: 1
and then the: 1
she'd come up: 1
said harry in: 1
at all his: 1
after ten million: 1
with a quietus: 1
consider it already: 1
agree with mr: 1
young girl and: 1
books like that: 1
you're really evil: 1
it turned out: 1
potter who'd betrayed: 1
ride broomsticks as: 1
her you requested: 1
and walked out: 1
if you know: 1
your military affairs: 1
time with the: 1

way behind them: 1
three black was: 1
grew wider as: 1
being good at: 1
and drag herself: 1
in that conspiracy: 1
win a cookie: 1
just found out: 1
fifty maybe i'd: 1
all three galleons: 1
there even though: 1
as she walked: 1
mr potter would: 1
in a rivalry: 1
j k rowling: 1
the ground where: 1
said harry would: 1
three galleons draco: 1
just think if: 1
forces beating granger: 1

theory is that: 1
silence stretched is: 1
don't know maybe: 1
he knew everything: 1
accompany him to: 1

been a terrible: 1
black were unregistered: 1
forward but there: 1

probably time to: 1
nervous and draco: 1
for them as: 1
of them if: 1
mudbloods and hufflepuffs: 1
already lost there: 1
scurry around and: 1
hermione was reading: 1

the boy-who-lived had: 1
offices for them: 1
other than cornelius: 1

on potter instead: 1
than harry's but: 1
anthony goldstein and: 1
first practicing the: 1
he was a: 1
in the class: 1

like it should: 1
an audience with: 1
suspicious things happen: 1
it'd be very: 1
problem he would: 1
day to sign: 1
announcement it just: 1
98 on one: 1
a natural sense: 1
class even if: 1
a casual and: 1
started to worry: 1
guaranteed the odds: 1

anyone else eating: 1
evil but she: 1
been deliberate if: 1
rat was pettigrew's: 1
well then professor: 1

and then she: 1
herself away because: 1
you're offering to: 1
were harry's voice: 1
the head auror: 1
did something that: 1
circuitry and proven: 1
to its own: 1
hermione had concluded: 1
charge when the: 1
a brilliant idea: 1
the class ended: 1
we say irregularities: 1

first-years are supposed: 1
as the pet: 1
professor quirrell she: 1

huge amounts way: 1
a chance to: 1
very simple question: 1
herself she turned: 1
anything special for: 1

front of everyone: 1
a desk would: 1
taken a hard: 1
a strange feeling: 1
front of the: 1
let me add: 1
the background there's: 1
outrage entirely off: 1
if we want: 1
much anymore about: 1
a teacher had: 1
said gravely it: 1

thoughtfully why yes: 1
the usual tone: 1

one beam of: 1
into four pieces: 1

you can't learn: 1
death it came: 1
she still felt: 1
on top of: 1
worried about whether: 1

that hurt really: 1
the way behind: 1
said harry potter: 1
it really that: 1

particular girl well: 1
harry into going: 1
professor quirrell could: 1
this that particular: 1
feat that harry: 1

battle all of: 1
harry said it's: 1
why people who: 1
once spoken dismissively: 1
okay first the: 1
said you're her: 1
had a reputation: 1
draco was starting: 1
not a thing: 1

what can i: 1
a classmate it: 1
relieved when harry: 1

walked slowly forward: 1
heart told you: 1
now except people: 1
for her to: 1
the generals needed: 1

i bought her: 1
grin i bought: 1
was a slight: 1
a conversation between: 1

of black not: 1
harry said patiently: 1
his voice serious: 1
magic and the: 1
was time for: 1
to be friends: 1
do you care: 1
malfoys or more: 1
a young girl: 1
and susan were: 1
green-trimmed robes and: 1
didn't understand that: 1
but professor quirrell: 1
walked onto the: 1
go around sabotaging: 1
like a glowing: 1
the way and: 1
michael shermer says: 1
do the spell: 1
granger wouldn't sabotage: 1
that harry was: 1
fists showing up: 1
a time when: 1
to climb out: 1
classmate it didn't: 1
bright funny famous: 1
their own dorm: 1
the one from: 1

hermione was giggling: 1

actually needed to: 1
killed a friend: 1
rest of the: 1
though they weren't: 1
it hermione snapped: 1
ashamed of being: 1
much shrieking and: 1
class ended and: 1
longer than the: 1

gazed steadily back: 1
standing in general: 1
she couldn't put: 1
didn't want to: 1
black outside their: 1
would always be: 1
by wasting money: 1
hermione realized she: 1
bit of ink: 1
miserable as the: 1
read books like: 1

study - did: 1
up either draco: 1
malfoy to be: 1
is back to: 1
plane on its: 1
legal system and: 1
half later like: 1
laughing in a: 1
your rival right: 1
like a throne: 1
out all these: 1
one can be: 1
cautiously i didn't: 1
via train station: 1
words oh no: 1

as her friend: 1
him unless professor: 1
hard - it: 1
sit and granger: 1
the rat anyway: 1
other straws she: 1
that helped when: 1

crush her we: 1
the door opened: 1
is a lot: 1
and even if: 1
way beyond what: 1

out of once: 1
all the offers: 1
on emotions more: 1
the teachers looked: 1
girl and called: 1
are telling me: 1
end of harry: 1
still in hogwarts: 1

much to ask: 1
of secrets so: 1
quietly it's not: 1
bill weasley off: 1
won so he: 1
merciful said the: 1
flicker anyway draco: 1
if you won: 1

rat hermione was: 1
of awed worship: 1
wednesday october 30th: 1
one time and: 1
miss granger i: 1
she heard the: 1
on the table: 1
harry said a: 1
to get back: 1
on thursday afternoon: 1
and the teachers: 1
even later but: 1
quiet i did: 1
book all right: 1
boy-who-lived reading a: 1
decided that his: 1
zabini professor quirrell: 1
chair much too: 1
practice against real: 1
sake of chaos: 1
launches an all-out: 1
professor quirrell leaning: 1
room between them: 1
was a classic: 1
dinner menu and: 1
hunt down pettigrew: 1
to teach -: 1
being miserable professor: 1
you're asking her: 1
fire without provocation: 1
she'd quite caught: 1
in the way: 1
away by letting: 1
too much to: 1
evil he's a: 1
of once you: 1
not suited to: 1
one single chair: 1
mystery to hermione: 1
fool professor quirrell: 1
rival and her: 1
of money draco: 1
of him and: 1
a little tightly: 1
doesn't mind losing: 1
the whole class: 1
given away by: 1
would convince harry: 1
be blunt professor: 1
bells started to: 1
and in that: 1
of people stuff: 1
shoulders as he: 1
age guy was: 1
know who the: 1
would be really: 1
into going on: 1
know what a: 1
because she didn't: 1
you think i'm: 1
in hogwarts broomstick: 1
third leg was: 1
called magical mnemonics: 1
trap to climb: 1
wasn't something she'd: 1
surely not there: 1
she turned me: 1
of quirrell points: 1
miss granger professor: 1
mcgonagall's tests the: 1
giggling helplessly it: 1
mechanics alluded to: 1
may take her: 1
and a half: 1
his voice don't: 1
bystanders turned into: 1
slowly forward but: 1
the disposal charm: 1
a candy shell: 1
the boy-who-lived you: 1
that his little: 1
can and this: 1
animagus form -: 1
but didn't clench: 1
weasley decided that: 1
sighed i don't: 1
something that deserved: 1
lying stomach-down on: 1
you don't ever: 1
as not to: 1
don't get to: 1
quite a known: 1
was his problem: 1
tactic so harry: 1
a play there: 1
just happens to: 1
this was a: 1
harry made a: 1
i appoint instead: 1
forced harry into: 1
merely have a: 1
to say that: 1
found out why: 1
animagus of something: 1
would fail to: 1
there were a: 1
and she walked: 1
i do be: 1
going on a: 1
and the quirrell: 1
looking surprised and: 1
much longer than: 1
dentist is mr: 1
very persuasive argument: 1
much more difficult: 1
help those four: 1
it harry said: 1
point where you: 1
minister fudge which: 1
wouldn't fight hard: 1
not even professor: 1
to do isn't: 1

with a library: 1
any distractions now: 1

she meant it: 1
i'm sure professor: 1

head but there: 1
in that direction: 1
an all-out attack: 1
of chaos draco: 1
concluded that 1: 1
the darkest creatures: 1
it into a: 1
it's rude to: 1
door opened there: 1
faced the hero: 1
professor quirrell though: 1
on sunday said: 1

he's gambling on: 1
putting a serious: 1
and had died: 1
right of course: 1
an evil grin: 1
classic undermining tactic: 1
and you're offering: 1
a while now: 1
sound like that: 1
wet grapes you: 1
hadn't stood up: 1
friends with granger: 1
red like stopsign: 1
pettigrew became an: 1
voice i must: 1
you as his: 1
rich by spending: 1
that much of: 1
about his lips: 1
plan namely they: 1
adult it was: 1
killed during his: 1
pettigrew was even: 1
forced to play: 1
as your supporter: 1
it more like: 1
harry didn't seem: 1
lost there i: 1
flobberworms and the: 1
sad and furtive: 1
is do you: 1
the heroine's love: 1
she did blame: 1
find the final: 1
out of him: 1
there was anyone: 1
outside the battlefield: 1
i damn it: 1
trust well then: 1
can always find: 1
had concluded that: 1
said primly you: 1
evidence so far: 1
in january the: 1
in her eyes: 1
it turns out: 1
around the corners: 1
were special events: 1
- hers was: 1
words she couldn't: 1
harry said draco: 1
the other way: 1
expected draco's eyes: 1
quirrell and hermione: 1
little superior don't: 1

that squeaked a: 1
not to help: 1
you don't get: 1
no fantasy and: 1
finish reading all: 1
voice was suddenly: 1
harry potter again: 1
he's a little: 1
and harry at: 1
you was fair: 1
want to risk: 1
didn't think what: 1
was right after: 1
when she left: 1
i'd take them: 1
worried because harry: 1
is it interlude: 1
now that was: 1
got it under: 1
points in that: 1
were going even: 1
quite a feat: 1
after all harry: 1
october 31st had: 1
muggleborn girl probably: 1
a rivalry with: 1
just the titles: 1
for things that: 1
the huge offices: 1
was a bit: 1
would make only: 1
potter she could: 1
foods and the: 1
herself become known: 1
little tightly what: 1
when your heart: 1
and which he: 1
it everto everto: 1
coming here you: 1
the general of: 1
said granger but: 1
evidence the conspiracy: 1
little nook was: 1
of his story: 1
of all the: 1
deserved a special: 1
potter said professor: 1
that's because she: 1
morag and padma: 1
knew the other: 1
that direction but: 1
a number of: 1
killed my parents: 1
not a double: 1
so far points: 1
with her hand: 1
gaping behind her: 1
credit professor quirrell: 1
said you wouldn't: 1
talk to anyone: 1
was really awful: 1
this for a: 1
of it staggered: 1
slowly raised his: 1
for a pound: 1
cornelius fudge who: 1
and everything you: 1
and found things: 1
granger sure said: 1
a couple of: 1
weasley off to: 1
real opponents using: 1
evil and she's: 1
gasped in horror: 1
harry sounded surprised: 1
just winning i'll: 1
you are tell: 1
hall had a: 1
harry october 31st: 1
you do indeed: 1
did my best: 1
to be in: 1
associated with black: 1
friends let me: 1
me to visit: 1
isn't worth my: 1
the thought before: 1
offering to help: 1
less than they: 1
tossed the pieces: 1
a sad and: 1
person yes hermione: 1
right about her: 1
you could even: 1
she'd forced harry: 1
his trunk so: 1
teacher had asked: 1
harry suddenly said: 1
was your plea: 1
been as famous: 1
why each general's: 1
mistake the silence: 1
surely would have: 1
for her being: 1
of course harry: 1
stuns and grabs: 1
accidentally given away: 1
conversation had suddenly: 1
and utter mystery: 1
subtle about always: 1
was the tenth: 1
hermione was occupying: 1
like garbage and: 1
i won't do: 1
birthday present and: 1
secrets so the: 1
beat on potter: 1
a quiet dignified: 1
knock upon that: 1
to recount how: 1
me against him: 1
wizarding lee harvey: 1
background there's a: 1
couldn't put it: 1
in a simple: 1
military command draco: 1
even get a: 1
tell you it's: 1
chance to draw: 1
arrange to be: 1
myself you are: 1
that the two: 1
before coming here: 1
a hufflepuff study: 1
- but professor: 1
harry potter day: 1

said with calm: 1
concerned draco had: 1
had turned down: 1
girl well said: 1
the two of: 1
you fell in: 1
the spirit of: 1
you are not: 1
final theory had: 1
to you was: 1
girl probably wouldn't: 1
that successful animagi: 1
at draco because: 1
not evil he's: 1
really any more: 1
professor sprout pettigrew: 1
showing up as: 1
talk harry was: 1
but you didn't: 1
wished her goodbye: 1

already know it: 1
only competent defense: 1
long oblong table: 1
has around as: 1
your army hermione's: 1
in completely the: 1
a hard trap: 1
the last straw: 1
yourself science disclaimers: 1
sadder science fiction: 1
about her needing: 1
you want an: 1
her hair really: 1
not in your: 1
chestnut curls drifting: 1
of other straws: 1
stuff are going: 1
empathy in ch: 1
argument one that: 1
a hufflepuff instead: 1
matter how aggressively: 1
on its way: 1
conversation between morag: 1
had been called: 1
to say something: 1
professor quirrell mildly: 1
was it really: 1
know we're going: 1
draco was all: 1
steadily back at: 1
had been the: 1
way to its: 1
managed to say: 1
on the room's: 1
rat harry said: 1
had seemed like: 1
pretty standard schizophrenic: 1
was occupying a: 1
i see granger: 1
than you think: 1
she thought she'd: 1
was still going: 1
then backing out: 1
to learn but: 1
wiped him out: 1

universe into good: 1
as a first: 1
a little wounded: 1
curls drifting over: 1
last straw piled: 1
check you know: 1
did want to: 1
understand harry said: 1
go around it: 1
couple of hours: 1
have been nice: 1
of something small: 1
conspiracy theories about: 1
harry wasn't going: 1
surprisingly diffident for: 1
an enemy wizarding: 1
harry potter's rival: 1
sober i'm sorry: 1
climb out of: 1
poor said granger: 1
chance at a: 1
the year nope: 1
junior minister in: 1

the general is: 1
asking her to: 1
this morning for: 1
didn't clench into: 1
wouldn't have been: 1
can't practice against: 1
you're a conspiracy: 1
or more likely: 1
quirrell leaning back: 1
seven years at: 1
i can call: 1
apology and warning: 1
talked about professor: 1
and hermione and: 1
to the weasleys': 1
she'd just stayed: 1
with her and: 1
the aurors arrested: 1
quirrell yes said: 1
be really unlikely: 1
really liking her: 1
persuasive argument one: 1
come to hermione: 1
try it again: 1
of the room: 1
straws she was: 1
thing i don't: 1
blame him though: 1
occupying a stuffed: 1
heard giggles coming: 1
i would fail: 1
everything's fine now: 1
these are wizards: 1
twitched but didn't: 1
think i'm pretty: 1
work it out: 1
draco both gasped: 1
wasn't as smart: 1
sympathetic voice and: 1
that when they: 1
been too sad: 1
way if anyone: 1
thing i would: 1
patronus charm depends: 1
red and when: 1
in the street: 1
doing anything special: 1
she'll probably never: 1
you've started really: 1
didn't get a: 1
little suspicious to: 1
said the spider: 1
says there are: 1
had suddenly hiccupped: 1
quirrell was evil: 1
about things instead: 1
was a reasonable: 1
her after being: 1
was much longer: 1
simple wooden chair: 1
other way are: 1
slytherin it's not: 1
the brightest academic: 1
that the theory: 1
owl messages -: 1
could do the: 1
sorry for how: 1
middle of the: 1
formulations of quantum: 1
command draco had: 1
battle magic if: 1
magical britain now: 1
say draco i: 1
oh no hermione: 1
dark lord's defeat: 1
would it said: 1
all due respect: 1
firm grasp on: 1
it wasn't something: 1
to commit an: 1
quite sure a: 1
miss granger would: 1
to lose a: 1
after the teacher: 1
much sooner than: 1
things out he'd: 1
draco said without: 1
the room between: 1
did sound like: 1
goldstein and ernie: 1
3 she liked: 1
a simple wooden: 1
to miss granger's: 1
harry potter beside: 1
point miss granger: 1
hermione nobody actually: 1
from crumpling it: 1
charm hermione sharpened: 1
while he was: 1
attacked him and: 1
in the possibilities: 1
on the other: 1
in a quiet: 1
nowhere for him: 1
few suggestions regarding: 1
at all of: 1
granger hadn't stood: 1
whole class and: 1
do isn't good: 1
rival all this: 1
eyebrows harry gazed: 1
read all the: 1
out of her: 1
though we don't: 1
attacking you after: 1
she walked onto: 1
be hard it: 1
distracted um hermione: 1
attack both of: 1
i'm speaking as: 1
smoothly i didn't: 1
be ashamed of: 1
she knew that: 1
from outside and: 1
hard it would: 1
the only competent: 1
you got too: 1
and anything less: 1
like a fighter: 1
hermione's jaw dropped: 1
other you could: 1
narrowed dear me: 1
your own brain: 1
thought she'd come: 1
ernie macmillan came: 1
her to do: 1
stopsign red not: 1
no one can: 1
harry but i: 1
so anyway sirius: 1
his book suspicious: 1
have considered a: 1
good and bad: 1
a nice birthday: 1
he still hadn't: 1
their little nook: 1
he was ninety-seven: 1
against ginevra weasley: 1
granger does too: 1
a double agent: 1
thought we were: 1
even if she: 1
harry oh don't: 1
sure professor quirrell: 1
have been but: 1
then with just: 1
are supposed to: 1
rat anyway just: 1
into good and: 1
was quiet at: 1
been like professor: 1
in a mild: 1
in a street: 1
flitwick wouldn't ever: 1
for it granger: 1
grasp on good: 1
me you've started: 1
years at hogwarts: 1
granger would appreciate: 1
his shoulders as: 1
wouldn't be seen: 1
joining your army: 1
give people compliments: 1
it of course: 1
more like garbage: 1
special foods and: 1
of conspiracy theories: 1
you won so: 1
something small that: 1
father and black: 1
my parents instead: 1
status in which: 1
where professor quirrell: 1
blaise zabini draco: 1
to slow down: 1
supposed to be: 1
spoke to you: 1
in your battle: 1
had agreed to: 1
emotions it wasn't: 1
his eyebrows harry: 1
been better off: 1
had windows along: 1
would never believe: 1
i call you: 1
sometimes she had: 1
would soon be: 1
like she was: 1
her to open: 1
circular tables scattered: 1
quirrell mildly is: 1
garbage and that: 1
damn it harry: 1
and she's probably: 1
boy-who-lived but she: 1
do not already: 1
he'd been good: 1
a few suggestions: 1
same voice then: 1
so it's not: 1
center of a: 1
she was the: 1
magics known a: 1
isn't quite a: 1
what was it: 1
hermione's stomach lately: 1
cheek thoughtfully why: 1
a rat you: 1
writing a letter: 1
why you never: 1
special exception they: 1
they could talk: 1
wanted to do: 1
help hermione raised: 1
weasley and padma: 1
beam of sunlight: 1
potter beside him: 1
why not mine: 1
said he was: 1
potter wants me: 1
there was the: 1
off to st: 1
speaking as her: 1
thinking it would: 1
interest it was: 1
telling me nothing: 1
usual expression besides: 1
while now and: 1
so they could: 1
have a lot: 1
had brainstormed before: 1
the hallways it: 1
shall we say: 1
praise now what: 1
interlude there was: 1
limited time offer: 1
as you are: 1
to advise her: 1
me i wouldn't: 1
attack on you: 1
potter came to: 1
would serve potter: 1
think he's crazy: 1
people don't talk: 1
by talking flobberworms: 1
fact i did: 1
our way said: 1
granger's hair like: 1
divided the universe: 1
get a trial: 1
a feat that: 1
had nightmares about: 1
lunch on thursday: 1
the twelve bystanders: 1
galleons and have: 1
miss granger's many: 1
chair and a: 1
me to shoot: 1
harry she'd been: 1
students were laughing: 1
ten galleons isn't: 1
said that was: 1
time founders forbid: 1
into a farce: 1
had died down: 1
him hermione was: 1
asked me for: 1
is it i: 1
involved in a: 1
the silence stretched: 1
lose and if: 1
are able to: 1
professor quirrell's lips: 1
equally instead of: 1
for how i: 1
was convinced he: 1
so the conspiracy: 1
now and he: 1
draco malfoy granger: 1
fight fairly against: 1
who was a: 1
we haven't analyzed: 1
think what he: 1
pretty sure he: 1
year of being: 1
of fact i: 1
the evidence so: 1
in it but: 1
so of course: 1
the malfoys or: 1
hers - hers: 1
hufflepuff instead of: 1
worried hermione will: 1
are four additional: 1
was only twelve: 1
let alone fake: 1
manner protest away: 1
some interesting spells: 1
could scurry around: 1
turned out to: 1
died and gone: 1
matter if professor: 1
so proud she'd: 1
your own and: 1
her does it: 1
not really any: 1
the slytherins didn't: 1
and somehow manages: 1
own brain to: 1
more evil for: 1
she was in: 1
they were both: 1
it was odd: 1
did anyone ever: 1
would you totally: 1
galleons isn't worth: 1
hogwarts broomstick riding: 1
sounding wounded and: 1
get in all: 1
hermione had to: 1
hannah and susan: 1
love interest or: 1
present and everything: 1
way at the: 1
had to know: 1
analyzed the brain: 1
lot of quirrell: 1
she is do: 1
unfortunately no one: 1
clear on why: 1
to be hermione: 1
drakey alarm bells: 1
you doing anything: 1
and megan were: 1
be the dark: 1
wants me to: 1
know it was: 1
be learning huge: 1
reasonable assumption but: 1
embarrassed about that: 1
giggles coming from: 1
wanted both it: 1
potter had too: 1
interesting spells your: 1
he talked about: 1
to azkaban see: 1
weasley red and: 1
stood before her: 1
convinced he was: 1
her cheeks faced: 1
the subject anyway: 1
only hope let: 1
expression flicker anyway: 1
voice what do: 1
who j k: 1
agent just someone: 1
pass read just: 1
skeptical wizard each: 1
attack you draco: 1
discover she would've: 1
keep up with: 1
even the one: 1
way on the: 1
just someone who: 1
general is yet: 1
wasn't even clear: 1
his wand let: 1
this at all: 1
than cornelius fudge: 1
piled on top: 1
and she said: 1
each had thought: 1
it out and: 1
and i'm a: 1
instead of me: 1
with her buckteeth: 1
be nice she'd: 1
when they get: 1
here you could: 1
you don't know: 1
k rowling is: 1
gone back in: 1
animagi are rare: 1
were a number: 1
or harass you: 1
said draco and: 1
f kennedy so: 1
around it diagonally: 1
sooner than you: 1
face well mr: 1
i you do: 1
trials hermione had: 1
said hermione sirius: 1
earned in your: 1
usual tone of: 1
i thought i'd: 1
you be about: 1
or worried about: 1
morag buzzing her: 1
be fair to: 1
time for her: 1
that made it: 1
and one of: 1
said neither of: 1
by one hermione's: 1
without any distractions: 1
granger and that: 1
hermione i've talked: 1
words torn out: 1
harry said after: 1
hard trap to: 1
any chance at: 1
thursday why everyone: 1
turned me down: 1
rival right then: 1
had when he: 1
harry said well: 1
if you got: 1
that was hard: 1
between morag and: 1
come with me: 1
with that soon: 1
a book while: 1
little i have: 1
hall she makes: 1
the armies of: 1
the theory of: 1
cast the patronus: 1
failed to touch: 1
was earning more: 1
instead draco just: 1
been a sinking: 1
tomorrow said hermione: 1
you go from: 1
think she'd quite: 1
be told who: 1
think that getting: 1
not draco malfoy's: 1
pettigrew himself killed: 1
from harry potter: 1
of harry's parents: 1
a malfoy wants: 1

peter pettigrew and: 1
no miss granger: 1
draco saw the: 1
with harry had: 1
to change the: 1
we don't know: 1
him though of: 1
seem like it: 1
finger on his: 1
gigantic blatant teacher's: 1
off his face: 1
now playing about: 1
her name happened: 1
i'm sorry hermione: 1
again instead of: 1
had too many: 1
as she realized: 1
on smoothly i'm: 1
she's probably going: 1
interest or worse: 1
learn so you: 1
penny in for: 1
this plan namely: 1
weren't ravenclaws and: 1
out to be: 1
i've already gotten: 1

most dreaded class: 1
quirrell draco said: 1
a much more: 1
her voice cut: 1
more nervous and: 1
could he had: 1
quiet he didn't: 1
her and harry: 1
miss granger blaise: 1
harry had once: 1
the top of: 1
back in time: 1
you can't believe: 1
to gather dumbledore: 1
all right she: 1
she's the only: 1
options on his: 1
professor quirrell the: 1

playing about his: 1
just about to: 1
the tables of: 1

had suggested that: 1
another fifty maybe: 1
conspiracy theories you: 1
be a separate: 1
can be told: 1
charm in january: 1
had to agree: 1
january the patronus: 1
me but would: 1
them away one: 1
and raised her: 1
instead of him: 1
fight someone very: 1
yes said draco: 1
professor quirrell slowly: 1
stood up either: 1
rat you win: 1
was suddenly enthusiastic: 1
harry had suggested: 1
but she still: 1
messages - oh: 1
listen to conversations: 1
with calm certainty: 1
that mixed apology: 1
wants an equal: 1
with just the: 1
tried to knock: 1
course harry wasn't: 1
was a very: 1
assumption but it: 1
27 you use: 1
an obvious mistake: 1
see her for: 1
without another word: 1
she knew it: 1
but it still: 1
who really betrayed: 1
she scored 98: 1
any further protests: 1
while even though: 1
for ravenclaw than: 1
her hermione i've: 1
to be insulted: 1
we can have: 1
hermione had felt: 1
amused anthony goldstein: 1
soldiers but i'm: 1

heroine's love interest: 1
said in his: 1
off to celebrate: 1
a friendly rival: 1
up so they: 1
spells your rival: 1
because it was: 1
the light -: 1

mild voice what: 1
when she scored: 1
professor quirrell looked: 1
able to keep: 1
voice don't tell: 1
known as harry's: 1
day harry had: 1
their way out: 1
little brother percy: 1
maybe she'll attack: 1
hand a bit: 1
friendship for hermione: 1
being subtle about: 1
less than you: 1
almost choked not: 1
crushed by the: 1
for the extracurricular: 1
right note of: 1
padma speculating that: 1
than i don't: 1
same time quite: 1
telling them to: 1
susan leanne and: 1

it into four: 1
that i'd be: 1
until their fifth: 1
magic class harry: 1

to fight fairly: 1
had to keep: 1
and we'd better: 1

clearly visible and: 1
didn't dare wear: 1
and hermione gritted: 1
named peter pettigrew: 1
not already know: 1

for a penny: 1
was so large: 1
news was that: 1

hero it was: 1
quiet sympathetic voice: 1
spider sitting in: 1
in blood with: 1
better not press: 1
for a teacher: 1

loud sounding like: 1
and now you're: 1
a little hard: 1
megan were sort: 1
the malfoys were: 1
azkaban he didn't: 1
worthy of your: 1
plot said professor: 1
in this plan: 1
so she'd forced: 1
that potter wants: 1
got too close: 1
her did you: 1
had that been: 1
competition might be: 1
wouldn't exactly expect: 1
was still in: 1
harry gaping behind: 1
are you doing: 1
for the house: 1
the boy wished: 1
fair fight said: 1
course the conspiracy: 1
you know we're: 1
special events and: 1
girl in front: 1
harry sounding a: 1
books in the: 1
her ears and: 1
you had before: 1
disposal charm hermione: 1
his dinner menu: 1
a fair fight: 1
had been not: 1
than attacking you: 1
horror you're not: 1
parents to voldemort: 1
up on the: 1
abruptly as she: 1
pettigrew to be: 1
staggered draco you: 1
was in it: 1
the carribean after: 1

there's a fourth-year: 1
fighting wizard that: 1
friend of my: 1
thought it was: 1

office it wasn't: 1
instead of miss: 1
with the malfoys: 1
have shot me: 1
offering to bribe: 1
wouldn't it it: 1
said draco utterly: 1
she did want: 1
as a sign: 1
her and mandy: 1
in his voice: 1
had thought this: 1
feeling in hermione's: 1
he'd just divided: 1
wasn't until an: 1
have to do: 1
quirrell could be: 1
chaos draco almost: 1
harry had turned: 1
eyes narrowed dear: 1
outside and she'd: 1
just asking for: 1
it with granger: 1
and i would: 1
he wants to: 1
always being near: 1
an unregistered animagus: 1
just stayed away: 1
voice then she: 1
been a play: 1
cast with pure: 1
you should have: 1
a dramatic and: 1
ankle-deep in blood: 1
add one more: 1
students don't usually: 1
it already lost: 1
usually learn the: 1
draco because mr: 1
draco utterly aghast: 1
battle magic class: 1
it would serve: 1
cheeks growing pink: 1
to anyone besides: 1
magic if you: 1
me you mean: 1
direction but we: 1
to really talk: 1
you credit professor: 1
door swung open: 1
bill knocks out: 1
furtive life as: 1
they got the: 1
dumbledore the minister: 1
harry said quietly: 1
i must protest: 1
more difficult book: 1
class wasn't until: 1
be plotting against: 1
an hour later: 1
her it made: 1
- said hermione: 1
and this is: 1
of sloppy but: 1
than ten galleons: 1
dear me said: 1
probably felt a: 1
train station and: 1
were just going: 1
suited to military: 1
his face he: 1
flashed draco a: 1
pink it had: 1
ask it was: 1
had yet realized: 1
own and the: 1
bribe me said: 1
teach - or: 1
their dinner menu: 1
him and wiped: 1
in a casual: 1
until she got: 1
stall that morning: 1
odds aren't even: 1
lay on the: 1
was you should: 1
macmillan came the: 1
so you will: 1
raised her cheeks: 1
and a desk: 1
against real opponents: 1
put said harry: 1
on his cheek: 1
of magic and: 1
fair to mr: 1
still going to: 1
listened fascinated but: 1
even the slytherins: 1
his move but: 1
that harry suddenly: 1
and mandy thinking: 1
and perfectly combed: 1
they took him: 1
learn later if: 1
surely so you: 1
called me up: 1
now what was: 1
was none other: 1
armies right yes: 1
quirrell to teach: 1
thursday afternoon and: 1
awful and she: 1
me nothing i: 1
two words oh: 1
up that girl: 1
and think about: 1
morag talking about: 1
chair in a: 1
other places maybe: 1
quirrell's lips grew: 1
which he really: 1
more suspicious than: 1
wasn't just that: 1
hermione will be: 1
to st mungo's: 1
either draco kept: 1
this is a: 1
everywhere once they: 1
years or even: 1
or portkey everywhere: 1
name like 'malfoy': 1
into a black-haired: 1
had died and: 1
snapped and maybe: 1
something to do: 1
only halfway through: 1
wouldn't be fair: 1
her needing to: 1
getting in her: 1
evil and she: 1
for the sake: 1
way that the: 1
might possibly maybe: 1
whole chapter in: 1
said students don't: 1
meaning he probably: 1
anyone besides her: 1
he wasn't as: 1
around professor quirrell's: 1
and get trials: 1
bad professor quirrell: 1
amounts way beyond: 1
said hermione and: 1
too and she: 1
her rival all: 1
nice birthday present: 1
you a galleon: 1
the ministry schedules: 1
sounding a bit: 1
i think it'd: 1
straw piled on: 1
an hour and: 1
haven't analyzed the: 1
by the boy-who-lived: 1
she knew the: 1
can offer me: 1
eyes and said: 1
professor quirrell sounding: 1
be living a: 1
we'd consider college: 1
for either of: 1
was literally his: 1
me too okay: 1
your praise now: 1
to do something: 1
intimidated him if: 1
personality is not: 1
will have a: 1
student killed during: 1
of a bowl: 1
was a traitor: 1
quirrell was right: 1
anything outside the: 1
all this time: 1
founders forbid said: 1
talking about how: 1
were focused and: 1
if he'd just: 1
draco she's your: 1
long story short: 1
thought had come: 1
out but that: 1
pet where professor: 1
draco professor quirrell: 1
he'll never be: 1
me and i: 1
his small animagus: 1
i have a: 1
know there's a: 1
made her feel: 1
number of shall: 1
if they got: 1
looked the other: 1
very fair draco: 1
of him there: 1
her - and: 1
hard enough to: 1
professor mcgonagall wouldn't: 1
should have shot: 1
just to be: 1
mistake if she'd: 1
about this no: 1
before unfortunately there: 1
and if she: 1
like stopsign red: 1
but that's because: 1
special dinnertime announcement: 1
to have considered: 1
decide he wanted: 1
peter pettigrew plus: 1
away one by: 1
and wipe you: 1
gracious as to: 1
he'd killed a: 1
harry was quiet: 1
been truly earned: 1
the library and: 1
at granger he: 1
like being forced: 1
for coming here: 1
get bored with: 1
and undeserving and: 1
the house of: 1
started to sound: 1
down pettigrew instead: 1
could lose another: 1
who could i: 1
with mr malfoy: 1
knew it was: 1
me and wipe: 1
by one by: 1
these emergency owl: 1
draw his wand: 1
that would've been: 1
pieces crumpled them: 1
floor looking at: 1
quirrell and i: 1
about professor quirrell: 1
hard to lose: 1
did offer to: 1
exactly expect evil: 1
control again really: 1
be the only: 1
all the books: 1
granger said looking: 1
if she'd just: 1
hermione it was: 1
attack the granger: 1
they tried the: 1
in the same: 1
old and had: 1
liking her after: 1
nature she would: 1
completely the wrong: 1
single chair like: 1
nice she'd actually: 1
professor quirrell will: 1
and just about: 1
the wrong place: 1
says that my: 1
to win against: 1
truly earned the: 1
in surprise her: 1
as famous as: 1
battles professor quirrell: 1
they dueled so: 1
list of soldiers: 1
pettigrew there's a: 1
don't believe that: 1
said the evil: 1
you think harry: 1
i shall be: 1
harry had brainstormed: 1
fell in no: 1
the conversation had: 1
said in for: 1
of being good: 1
clench into fists: 1
on it tore: 1
she said what: 1
out why you: 1
to ask someone: 1
to learn so: 1
students do way: 1
wouldn't mean anything: 1
was right about: 1
much too large: 1
and taken but: 1
they want to: 1
in charge when: 1
deliberate if it: 1
harry granger wouldn't: 1
flattered and also: 1
knock again her: 1
hermione stood there: 1
part of his: 1
to sit and: 1
not been in: 1
who'd betrayed the: 1
also a little: 1
a lot more: 1
potter had been: 1
when they were: 1
not joining your: 1
obviously harry potter: 1
during his time: 1
had been well: 1
might have been: 1
eyewitnesses to recount: 1
dramatic and dignified: 1
and his head: 1
position than either: 1
to make a: 1
been invited hogwarts: 1
malfoy you think: 1
it was the: 1
oblong table stretched: 1
and what do: 1
finding out all: 1
know if you: 1
quietus field up: 1
schedules were made: 1
who was earning: 1
that implied -: 1
the battlefield hermione: 1
would have worked: 1
him draco shivered: 1
a stuffed chair: 1
annoyed her harry: 1
likely suspect to: 1
anyone in hogwarts: 1
this no said: 1
had a very: 1
suggested that they: 1
harry said in: 1
flaw in this: 1
how aggressively they: 1
to notice myself: 1
only one in: 1
the minister of: 1
belonged until next: 1
chapter in this: 1
you ten galleons: 1
but she would: 1
possibly maybe help: 1
call you hermy: 1
turned down all: 1
library and then: 1
faced the villain: 1
first granger was: 1
been relieved when: 1
a black-haired boy: 1
professor quirrell yes: 1
piece of parchment: 1
traitor a friend: 1
it this year: 1
looked at draco: 1
know maybe after: 1
left for dinner: 1
right yes hermione: 1
against me you: 1
say after the: 1
of this at: 1
probably never give: 1
books said that: 1
one in our: 1
as smart the: 1
hermione center of: 1
her being miserable: 1
then professor quirrell: 1
away from harry: 1
out of black: 1
just from crumpling: 1
money when your: 1
unregistered animagi too: 1
heard morag talking: 1
good fight much: 1
quirrell will let: 1
the third army: 1
thinks first-years are: 1
right she said: 1
little propeller plane: 1
you have any: 1
shower stall this: 1
be some sort: 1
day in his: 1
change the subject: 1
she'd actually said: 1
who's a metamorphmagus: 1
don't know if: 1
nice if draco: 1
was more like: 1
or arrange to: 1
charms homework for: 1
minded you can't: 1
and a little: 1
granger girl first: 1
black was the: 1
mr potter i: 1
they use veritas: 1
the way on: 1
of course hermione: 1
well to antipsychotics: 1
this when they: 1
harry start giggling: 1
imagine he could: 1
not established yet: 1
us a good: 1
wear black outside: 1
still hadn't made: 1
harry spent the: 1
his sadder science: 1
great hall she: 1
say irregularities associated: 1
hermione had thought: 1
friendly rival like: 1
harry's parents to: 1
perfectly combed white-blonde: 1
you are telling: 1
draco had also: 1
something but the: 1
to win she: 1
your friendship for: 1
combed white-blonde hair: 1
there with her: 1
granger but you: 1
the size of: 1
a whole chapter: 1
said slowly must: 1
silently swore to: 1
about here so: 1
her hand quite: 1
he and harry: 1
quirrell said she: 1
said the words: 1
zabini draco said: 1
so instead draco: 1
suspicious to hermione: 1
she has justly: 1
i spoke to: 1
get there they: 1
you said draco: 1
that harry potter's: 1
the location of: 1
focused and driven: 1
more likely off: 1
been hermione granger: 1
that would convince: 1
fiction books no: 1
that my father: 1
turned into his: 1
first pass read: 1
she'd expect the: 1
myself to disagree: 1
the legal system: 1
said hermione it: 1
stall this morning: 1
fields of doom: 1
have minded you: 1
quirrell though one: 1
guy was convinced: 1
strength professor quirrell: 1
and when the: 1
you earlier we: 1
she really did: 1
boy wished her: 1
so they dragged: 1
down black he: 1
want to die: 1
but no trial: 1
her book all: 1
and get her: 1
dinner menu she'd: 1
out that he'd: 1
was concerned draco: 1
be friends with: 1
like an appealing: 1
want an equal: 1
to fight you: 1
and granger hadn't: 1
voice serious as: 1
said harry i'm: 1
of course she: 1
hermione and harry: 1
terrible mistake if: 1
with harry potter: 1
you are you: 1
the office from: 1
quirrell the competition: 1
his time at: 1
after you've already: 1
more quiet he: 1
the usual expression: 1
be friends can: 1
when he talked: 1
rare and doing: 1
family he'd either: 1
said draco smoothly: 1
hermione couldn't imagine: 1
move i see: 1
miss granger's first: 1
it was obviously: 1
was giggling helplessly: 1
problems with this: 1
the words had: 1
that morning and: 1
granger has around: 1
make only this: 1
for anyone else: 1
i've talked to: 1
made his move: 1
to ask it: 1
to be living: 1
and the ability: 1
like you said: 1
malfoys were poor: 1
tables of contents: 1
promise not to: 1
four black was: 1
duel between them: 1
small circular tables: 1
i'd be shocked: 1
saw her expression: 1
of plot harry: 1
bellatrix black was: 1
suspicion in his: 1
fair to her: 1
what's wrong with: 1
general's office was: 1
she couldn't blame: 1
harry had seemed: 1
have been like: 1
cousin three black: 1
students talking about: 1
was a table: 1
known scientific fact: 1
was that harry: 1
and gone back: 1
do you go: 1
famous for herself: 1
so elegant that: 1
going to fool: 1
how hard he: 1
if professor quirrell: 1
him if you: 1
windows along one: 1
a bit higher: 1
of her or: 1
black-haired boy until: 1
shot john f: 1
with you or: 1
than the ones: 1
ability to cast: 1
to sound in: 1
why everyone had: 1
what a dentist: 1
sure said draco: 1
was fair why: 1
all the problems: 1
time quite a: 1
sunday draco was: 1
to play dodgeball: 1
again but she: 1
'malfoy' is just: 1
do way less: 1
in his most: 1
his younger self: 1
stare you're not: 1
doing all that: 1
the news wasn't: 1
not realize let: 1
came to me: 1
maybe not even: 1
evil first having: 1
sirius black was: 1
the first battle: 1
and one beam: 1
unregistered animagus while: 1
use your own: 1
word that had: 1
on one of: 1
shell harry had: 1
he stood before: 1
the implications before: 1
fourth-year girl in: 1
professor quirrell didn't: 1
but to harry: 1
as the third: 1
wants ten galleons: 1
been a spy: 1
learn battle magic: 1
that was one: 1
to apparate or: 1
around sabotaging your: 1
against her nature: 1
he said it: 1
but not there: 1
if anyone ran: 1
malfoy but my: 1
want to get: 1
kept walking i: 1
form - hermione's: 1
the offers even: 1
really evil did: 1
professor quirrell went: 1
up on sunday: 1
so as not: 1
know the aurors: 1
you will be: 1
sounding like the: 1
i shouldn't be: 1
evil pettigrew to: 1
hermione listened fascinated: 1
drifting over her: 1
how do you: 1
slowly i don't: 1
had taken a: 1
as they headed: 1
what do they: 1
blood with twenty: 1
and swiftly draco: 1
been not right: 1
been called halloween: 1
him and one: 1
up casually behind: 1
and me but: 1
aren't even good: 1
a way something: 1
to escort her: 1
malfoy draco smiled: 1
draco silently swore: 1
to celebrate even: 1
then he flashed: 1
harry potter was: 1
brilliant idea she'd: 1
at hogwarts anything: 1
evil did anyone: 1
of your forces: 1
then i promise: 1
oh i don't: 1
like the words: 1
had scored seven: 1
on herself she: 1
know damn it: 1
have been a: 1
wounded by your: 1
points for ravenclaw: 1
came the thought: 1
at least harry: 1
the brain circuitry: 1
mine think about: 1
doesn't really seem: 1
less than ten: 1
wizard that pettigrew: 1
so hard -: 1
before they took: 1
in hogwarts who: 1
was harry potter: 1
totally would and: 1
being miserably crushed: 1
hair faced the: 1
show you some: 1
more like it: 1
mixed apology and: 1
going even redder: 1
have to see: 1
the pieces on: 1
far points in: 1
manor my father: 1
learning the patronus: 1
again an hour: 1
don't tell me: 1
practicing something they: 1
who the general: 1
fought over them: 1
in place of: 1
was thinking it: 1
quite a lot: 1
without hesitation any: 1
harry would never: 1
single chair all: 1
and he responded: 1
a teenager would: 1
good fight and: 1
cheerful atmosphere when: 1
more likely suspect: 1
you know tomorrow: 1
granger it was: 1
but these are: 1
being forced to: 1
her harry was: 1
away because it: 1

on his dinner: 1

while he waited: 1
she makes her: 1
needed to ride: 1

granger but i: 1
at hogwarts and: 1
her head it: 1
to study -: 1
speculating that harry: 1
quirrell didn't anyone: 1
fight less than: 1
a thing i: 1
potter day harry: 1
get a chance: 1
after the dark: 1
even though his: 1
you've already lost: 1
in a hufflepuff: 1
her or worried: 1
months to learn: 1
on a slight: 1
always be the: 1
rival but that's: 1
rival harry said: 1
couldn't imagine he: 1
offer mr malfoy: 1
don't ever ask: 1
equal fight at: 1
said it's really: 1
supporter and then: 1
should have come: 1
still felt embarrassed: 1
said draco you: 1
draco was pretty: 1
million years the: 1
not to spoil: 1
that 1 leanne: 1
to fight someone: 1
theories you remember: 1
hufflepuffs the whole: 1
quirrell went on: 1
was a more: 1
pettigrew's death it: 1
the ground with: 1
was probably time: 1
hermione said primly: 1
learning huge amounts: 1
blame him since: 1
snack bars in: 1
rather than attacking: 1
potter would it: 1
secretly help her: 1
out there were: 1
brother percy stuns: 1
to older students: 1
audience with me: 1
he was from: 1
his love interest: 1
stretched is this: 1
to risk a: 1
catch her if: 1
the rest of: 1
been famous for: 1
them and tossed: 1
if draco could: 1
even though we: 1
the tenth anniversary: 1
chair all the: 1
about this that: 1
surgery anyway bill: 1
will let me: 1
hufflepuff who's a: 1
talking about her: 1
her some other: 1
find the words: 1
not guaranteed the: 1
way out of: 1
would be after: 1
that and if: 1
he had a: 1
i get bored: 1
in his trunk: 1
theories and you: 1
bought her a: 1
his elbows resting: 1
off in the: 1
of shall we: 1
that muggleborn girl: 1
story short bill: 1
the teacher said: 1
you want are: 1
plea come with: 1
odd to think: 1
a slight flaw: 1
theories about who: 1
professor quirrell consider: 1
growing pink it: 1
to keep telling: 1
would've died a: 1
meant you were: 1
are going to: 1
it you wanted: 1
all i don't: 1
outstanding academic talents: 1
it as a: 1
lately every time: 1
shocked to find: 1
his feet kicking: 1
the smile playing: 1
four pieces crumpled: 1
the competition might: 1
there's all sorts: 1
was draco's turn: 1
- hold on: 1
to be taught: 1
boy-who-lived had an: 1
and boys fought: 1
they have not: 1
through the legal: 1
but i thought: 1
she has the: 1
talked to older: 1
the reason out: 1
out all sorts: 1
crazy but they: 1
help me against: 1
much intent to: 1
to stare you're: 1
since in fact: 1
but he was: 1
harry harry sighed: 1
a more likely: 1
knew where my: 1
play there would: 1
harry tagged along: 1
i promise not: 1
form and ran: 1
was like they: 1
my list of: 1
things instead of: 1
she'd overheard a: 1
did you say: 1
later but professor: 1
thing maybe she'll: 1
escorting a sad: 1
but why not: 1
hermione it's -: 1
invited hogwarts got: 1
of the options: 1
potter might decide: 1
charmingly no miss: 1
their fifth years: 1
up a good: 1
just one special: 1
already gotten my: 1
to you first: 1
the options on: 1
was like being: 1
professor quirrell called: 1
one more or: 1
get a strange: 1
swiftly draco saw: 1
four small circular: 1
that those two: 1
ensconced in a: 1
when she'd overheard: 1
and the ground: 1
it i agree: 1
he wants ten: 1
time at all: 1
a general turns: 1
and then hermione: 1
i was thinking: 1
draco after we: 1
though one less: 1
some of his: 1
would hunt down: 1
voice had when: 1
was nowhere for: 1
the granger girl: 1
dark and a: 1
you on sunday: 1
floo or portkey: 1
the corners but: 1
and i shouldn't: 1
celebrate even the: 1
well said draco: 1
menu and boys: 1
with his elbows: 1
know why of: 1
bashful and undeserving: 1
into a romance: 1
we were friends: 1
she didn't want: 1
want to lose: 1
a very strange: 1
end the room: 1
on why the: 1
black going to: 1
a reasonable assumption: 1
everything i do: 1
laughing and i'm: 1
why that's very: 1
look on his: 1
would 2 hannah: 1
hour later hermione: 1
of them to: 1
to voldemort so: 1
black is the: 1
she was starting: 1
it just think: 1
think if i: 1
back in his: 1
as i expected: 1
more as a: 1
conspiracy theorist you: 1
potter's rival had: 1
malfoy wouldn't it: 1
as a teenager: 1
and left harry: 1
with their charms: 1
as he lay: 1
a separate person: 1
it was harry: 1
to be blunt: 1
was obviously harry: 1
you mean rather: 1
ask her harry: 1
seesaw it would: 1
are absolutely positively: 1
every time she: 1
red not weasley: 1
sure a chair: 1
draco kept the: 1
class the news: 1
they can and: 1
to see her: 1
behind them on: 1
tried the quiet: 1
beyond what the: 1
needed offices at: 1
ravenclaws hermione was: 1
no good way: 1
mungo's and it: 1
them but she: 1
was odd to: 1
and also a: 1
dignified memorial service: 1
was lying stomach-down: 1
should have been: 1
of james potter: 1
even more evil: 1
said harry sounding: 1
that he thinks: 1
hadn't been invited: 1
idea at first: 1
face the most: 1
granger it had: 1
feel bashful and: 1
opposite end the: 1
shrieking and almost: 1
time i am: 1
on the shelf: 1
and morag buzzing: 1
though his own: 1
see harry said: 1
the favorites is: 1
special for tomorrow: 1
and the head: 1
be with the: 1
you after you've: 1
the duel between: 1
thought of her: 1
voldemort so it: 1
magical mnemonics harry: 1
minister in charge: 1
the door and: 1
tell you that: 1
too large for: 1
going to azkaban: 1
to say in: 1
aghast i never: 1
it came out: 1
place of meals: 1
draco and harry: 1
don't talk as: 1
dangerous to give: 1
just attack the: 1
is this some: 1
just walk away: 1
even professor snape: 1
break it just: 1
bring myself to: 1
suddenly hiccupped that: 1
granger is going: 1
and she would: 1
harry thought of: 1
i don't like: 1
hufflepuffs no matter: 1
draco's eyes narrowed: 1
do you have: 1
scored the highest: 1
we can learn: 1
memorial service somewhere: 1
brain to simulate: 1
getting into a: 1
it if it: 1
that and then: 1
her we can: 1
draco appointing her: 1
have gritted his: 1
james potter who'd: 1
trying so hard: 1
to keep up: 1
hermione granger had: 1
one less than: 1
draco and me: 1
hermione granger has: 1
friendly rival harry: 1
the street laughing: 1
can i just: 1
now that doesn't: 1
pettigrew instead of: 1
did not ask: 1
he saw her: 1
and maybe a: 1
to catch her: 1
opened there was: 1
any way that: 1
ears and eyes: 1
a piece of: 1
draco's only hope: 1
considered a very: 1
quirrell her voice: 1
was right harry: 1
granger hermione stood: 1
of you be: 1
called the skeptical: 1
choked not in: 1
how i spoke: 1
of running as: 1
into words she: 1
hermione looked up: 1
her if she: 1
reason for coming: 1
hermione i've already: 1
- not a: 1
they're not established: 1
found the boy-who-lived: 1
the odds aren't: 1
because mr malfoy: 1
magical strength professor: 1
so would i: 1
ch 27 you: 1
aurors would be: 1
to find him: 1
do it to: 1
her for yourself: 1
harry i'm getting: 1
patiently we're supposed: 1
just meant you: 1
must everything i: 1
signed up to: 1
where to find: 1
get your own: 1
it was that: 1
of justice granger: 1
and she shouldn't: 1
was evil but: 1
the armies then: 1
it for anyone: 1
isn't it just: 1
it tore it: 1
he responded perfectly: 1
turn on the: 1
is not a: 1
his voice exasperated: 1
quirrell said gravely: 1
she's your rival: 1
was from this: 1
sense kicked in: 1
this particular girl: 1
their giggles had: 1
then hermione could: 1
smile playing around: 1
you hermy draco: 1
draco angrily i: 1
that is right: 1
expect evil pettigrew: 1
grew up was: 1
pushing up on: 1
believe granger is: 1
have come from: 1
could read all: 1
turned out in: 1
like they didn't: 1
realize we should: 1
theory requires and: 1
down just as: 1
while hermione was: 1
way are you: 1
had to put: 1
conspiracy theories and: 1
as he could: 1
heard harry start: 1
a much easier: 1
a sad little: 1
granger so surely: 1
if he'd been: 1
an animagus of: 1
was a candidate: 1
his head in: 1
dear me mr: 1
broken by two: 1
was a setup: 1
granger the brightest: 1
there they think: 1
until next thursday: 1
was a hard: 1
the fighting wizard: 1
if you can't: 1
we crush her: 1
animagi too and: 1
since he was: 1
year with any: 1
quirrell slowly raised: 1
up in front: 1
learn this when: 1
notice myself you: 1
black he was: 1
is where it: 1
galleons draco was: 1
voice cut off: 1
being evil harry: 1
friendly concern said: 1
about always being: 1
possibly have intimidated: 1
never signed up: 1
father's named peter: 1
mr draco malfoy: 1
known a weapon: 1
keep telling them: 1
as much anymore: 1
classes her personality: 1
draco wasn't quite: 1
ask someone even: 1
of magic that: 1
hand to knock: 1
it should have: 1
hadn't made his: 1
titles no matter: 1
put up a: 1
the third general: 1
could possibly have: 1
double agent just: 1
lord killed my: 1
suspicious than i: 1
a metamorphmagus said: 1
don't understand harry: 1
waited to escort: 1
field up so: 1
the thing to: 1
doing it as: 1
was after lunch: 1
a known scientific: 1
top of granger's: 1
least check so: 1
getting involved in: 1
all the evidence: 1
well then i: 1
draco sounding wounded: 1
had gone on: 1
draco just said: 1
and padma speculating: 1
heard the other: 1
students who sign: 1
and now that: 1
really did sound: 1
granger's many outstanding: 1
realized it was: 1
to mandy because: 1
instead of a: 1
said okay try: 1
a student killed: 1
around as much: 1
that was much: 1
harry was reading: 1
wasting money you: 1
me and it: 1
quirrell said neither: 1
behind him hermione: 1
to mr potter: 1
a probe than: 1
the villain leaning: 1
gambling on her: 1
patronus charm until: 1
later if we: 1
time at hogwarts: 1
been good at: 1
concern said professor: 1
quite caught all: 1
close to the: 1
little bit dark: 1
bored with just: 1
why of course: 1
web was it: 1
up to fight: 1
dare wear black: 1
alone fake all: 1
not the same: 1
for her like: 1
farce harshly put: 1
own contest without: 1
with his book: 1
said in the: 1
not just in: 1
after a bit: 1
why yes yes: 1
voice and she: 1
quite failed to: 1
than anything else: 1
that hermione didn't: 1
harry potter bright: 1
read just the: 1
has a very: 1
once he stood: 1
aurors tracked down: 1
and proven it: 1
looked up from: 1
morning and just: 1
me said granger: 1
horrible brushes with: 1
was granger so: 1
yet either there'd: 1
about it always: 1
in our first: 1
sure you want: 1
said a little: 1
said more as: 1
angry though harry: 1
talk as much: 1
luosha points out: 1
a stern look: 1
professor mcgonagall's tests: 1

black was twenty: 1
after him i: 1
pieces on the: 1
homework for a: 1
was a time: 1
had been his: 1
and grabs the: 1
though of course: 1
for professor quirrell's: 1
hers - and: 1
the recipient might: 1
suddenly said out: 1
the same voice: 1
granger said once: 1
did blame him: 1
he's crazy but: 1
find the thing: 1
draco putting a: 1
he lay on: 1
mandy thinking she: 1
voice that squeaked: 1
general turns it: 1
never done that: 1
about how that: 1
draco malfoy's surely: 1
it's not the: 1
still annoyed her: 1
the day in: 1
academic star of: 1
you could lose: 1
of the favorites: 1
and of course: 1
a special dinnertime: 1
stuff and now: 1
of miss granger: 1
you totally would: 1
you are able: 1
it was impossible: 1
have a natural: 1
the idea of: 1
at a fair: 1
pettigrew plus twelve: 1
he didn't harry: 1
a weapon against: 1
serious look on: 1
it's - her: 1
but i'm her: 1
in class even: 1
snape would have: 1
just as i: 1
he was standing: 1
the water when: 1
there's a whole: 1
your plea come: 1
door and then: 1
took him to: 1
can i say: 1
instead of trying: 1
draco's head but: 1
scored 98 on: 1
door had closed: 1
you it was: 1
gravely it can: 1
slowly must everything: 1
a little nervous: 1
rivaling harry potter: 1
be good for: 1
ones he usually: 1
seemed like an: 1
not right hermione: 1
intention of a: 1
wasn't quite sure: 1
i doubt miss: 1
table in the: 1
she shouldn't be: 1
in any way: 1
and ernie macmillan: 1
not mine think: 1
mr malfoy are: 1
instead the boy-who-lived: 1
become known as: 1
had been relieved: 1
it similarly timeless: 1
primly you are: 1
a mild voice: 1
you some interesting: 1
looked a little: 1
redder you're really: 1
and bad professor: 1
have me attack: 1
pretty stupid don't: 1
it wouldn't mean: 1
words and she: 1
standard schizophrenic break: 1
didn't anyone ever: 1
theorist you can: 1
her feel flattered: 1
yes hermione harry: 1
same time i: 1
since hermione couldn't: 1
there should have: 1
requested an audience: 1
romance with harry: 1
large draco wasn't: 1
could i appoint: 1
competent defense professor: 1
up her stride: 1
do that said: 1
outside their own: 1
equal fight less: 1
walked out of: 1
family bellatrix black: 1
ever finish reading: 1
lot slytherin it's: 1
case draco was: 1
a teenager even: 1
book titles no: 1
office without another: 1
probably didn't even: 1
and so she: 1
was his love: 1
and furtive life: 1
each other you: 1
sound in draco's: 1
else we can: 1
didn't harry said: 1
really seem fair: 1
she left for: 1
wizards we're talking: 1
she was back: 1
would i do: 1
laughing at both: 1
all his fault: 1
hermione that she: 1
draco said more: 1
blunt professor quirrell: 1
ground where she: 1
with mr potter: 1
with hannah susan: 1
down all the: 1
soon be hers: 1
them to slow: 1
a candidate for: 1
granger does you: 1
options on their: 1
know the malfoys: 1
off abruptly as: 1
a dentist is: 1
suspect that she: 1
it would go: 1
little wounded and: 1
i just found: 1

and draco silently: 1
his own class: 1
been nice if: 1
to military command: 1
it i just: 1
one wall and: 1
slip you a: 1
having a name: 1
were rivaling harry: 1
for him he: 1
to be sure: 1
contents hermione had: 1
a little worried: 1
study hall had: 1
cheeks were going: 1
not ask her: 1
she'd never done: 1
things happen all: 1
person again instead: 1
voice a little: 1
said out loud: 1
his fault but: 1
worse she had: 1
harry in a: 1
and warning saying: 1
perfectly well to: 1
a long story: 1
the boy-who-lived that: 1
was only halfway: 1
to talk to: 1
harry actually was: 1
you wouldn't exactly: 1
a serious look: 1
was that too: 1
he wanted to: 1
the students who: 1
convince harry professor: 1
a small classroom: 1
something but no: 1
likely off in: 1
decency to be: 1
the possibilities he: 1
answer had not: 1
being silly and: 1
problem being that: 1
and his feet: 1
date with her: 1
of professor mcgonagall's: 1

but my parents: 1
getting into the: 1
going to prove: 1
to his younger: 1
sounded surprised and: 1
a sign of: 1
sped up her: 1
what so would: 1
to turn on: 1
her like she: 1
one of professor: 1
bit higher she: 1
stomach-down on the: 1
to share a: 1
from where the: 1
two of you: 1
the skeptical wizard: 1
that wasn't even: 1
harry said professor: 1

wrong with zabini: 1
visible and stray: 1
just divided the: 1
all of growing: 1
in p e: 1

- or arrange: 1
more points than: 1
a shrugging motion: 1
to face the: 1
black would hunt: 1

respect to miss: 1
additional problems with: 1

draco could have: 1
quirrell sounding quite: 1
good for her: 1

quirrell's armies right: 1
or mr potter: 1

around what we'd: 1
that professor quirrell: 1

been a quiet: 1
maybe a little: 1
of your praise: 1
versus professor sprout: 1
that been deliberate: 1

he really should: 1
granger's first battles: 1
refuse but you: 1
from this particular: 1
choice from you: 1
defeat harry said: 1
army even though: 1
why black would: 1
less than he: 1
walking i already: 1
oh no harry: 1
service somewhere and: 1
always being thursday: 1
friend of james: 1
boys fought over: 1
done with his: 1
smile now playing: 1
of ink on: 1

draco said in: 1
in a little: 1
ch 28 are: 1
kennedy so anyway: 1
time offer mr: 1
he launches an: 1
around and found: 1
and the junior: 1
never mind your: 1
from her book: 1
to help general: 1
he doesn't mind: 1
fashion had that: 1
sends out all: 1
think you're getting: 1
to normal and: 1
getting complicated hermione: 1
broomstick riding harry: 1
had come to: 1
halfway through hers: 1
alluded to in: 1
hermione shook her: 1
crown it would: 1
to antipsychotics and: 1
i'll try that: 1
we both attacked: 1
many outstanding academic: 1
but you can: 1
you knew and: 1
should have gritted: 1
others isn't quite: 1
but if you: 1
and relaxed manner: 1
on sunday draco: 1
buckteeth clearly visible: 1
headed toward the: 1
a quietus field: 1
people compliments like: 1
instead of harry: 1
the rat sends: 1
and hufflepuffs no: 1
want to do: 1
the whole study: 1
scientific fact the: 1
buzzing her and: 1
shermer says there: 1
her eyes and: 1
hot tea on: 1
of meals reading: 1
superior don't you: 1
said draco see: 1
of contents hermione: 1
worth my time: 1
morning for everything: 1
hiccupped that answer: 1
even if you: 1
she realized yes: 1
him a stern: 1
shoot someone he: 1
felt a lot: 1
- he's gambling: 1
about whether she: 1
was a gigantic: 1
further as for: 1
rivalry with harry: 1
slight smile now: 1
be a pretty: 1
later like a: 1
fudge which might: 1
class in hogwarts: 1
know whether to: 1
you offering to: 1
it didn't matter: 1
but she thought: 1
arrested black was: 1
said draco appointing: 1
back or harass: 1
suggest that both: 1
hermione and of: 1
say something but: 1
to me but: 1
you win a: 1
she had gone: 1
she didn't actually: 1
to start with: 1
fairly against me: 1
them as a: 1
didn't matter if: 1
draco i merely: 1
draco stared at: 1
she knew but: 1
fantasy and writing: 1
than he wants: 1
aggressively they dueled: 1
her hand a: 1
plus twelve bystanders: 1
the sort of: 1
to attack evil: 1
from this really: 1
you can't practice: 1
hermione but he: 1
to spoil it: 1
appreciate your friendly: 1
higher she tried: 1
black before they: 1
said cautiously i: 1
right then with: 1
- and somehow: 1
want to be: 1
depends on emotions: 1
in this book: 1
believe that a: 1
of doom and: 1
he's going to: 1
could have been: 1
giggles had died: 1
potter i did: 1
to professor quirrell's: 1
and dad that: 1
there laughing in: 1
of you equally: 1
this really nasty: 1
four with their: 1
elbows resting on: 1
people point to: 1
especially as you: 1
twenty times the: 1
fair draco said: 1
done that maybe: 1
knew that harry: 1
dismissively of people: 1
had closed all: 1
he was right: 1
he's not evil: 1
hard to refuse: 1
like that when: 1
provocation on a: 1
emotions more than: 1
a bit distracted: 1
be learning the: 1
to open fire: 1
it starts getting: 1
positive emotions it: 1
i have taken: 1
natural sense of: 1
would go against: 1
to worry that: 1
walked there even: 1
story you didn't: 1
consider college age: 1
draco if i: 1
whole study hall: 1
and relax and: 1
there now after: 1
while he launches: 1
suggestions said professor: 1
of our way: 1
exasperated he's not: 1
told who j: 1
okay in sparring: 1
of me for: 1
that conspiracy theory: 1
guess what so: 1
very evil and: 1
prove it there: 1
on his face: 1
an appealing idea: 1
she wouldn't have: 1
said granger this: 1
dad that was: 1
at all three: 1
with all due: 1
because harry didn't: 1
casual and relaxed: 1
there professor quirrell: 1
to mum and: 1
rephrase that said: 1
reading all the: 1
own dorm there: 1
she'd almost burst: 1
ten galleons and: 1
with any chance: 1
really should have: 1
regarding miss granger's: 1
dramatic music the: 1
awed worship that: 1
pettigrew and this: 1
had thought it: 1
hermione didn't think: 1
upon that terrible: 1
warning saying at: 1
a voice that: 1
worry that harry: 1
to learn it: 1
your appointment of: 1
a conspiracy theorist: 1
as the boy-who-lived: 1
do be some: 1
professor quirrell her: 1
what harry thought: 1
lose a single: 1
anyway draco said: 1
really it was: 1
scored in class: 1
do to you: 1
don't usually learn: 1
asked them to: 1
about and now: 1
dryly especially as: 1
mr malfoy but: 1
even though they: 1
lot more nervous: 1
jet escorting a: 1
surprised and you're: 1
separate person again: 1
my time at: 1
learn it professor: 1
hermione didn't know: 1
be seen as: 1
we're talking about: 1
parents were harry's: 1
than him if: 1
sorts of conspiracy: 1
and evil and: 1
the final theory: 1
in ch 28: 1
it's really awful: 1
miserably crushed by: 1
in ch 27: 1
about it hermione: 1
that pettigrew became: 1
was draco's only: 1
himself yes harry: 1
what about sabotaging: 1
back to normal: 1
morning when she'd: 1
learn but she's: 1
granger is unfit: 1
fake all the: 1
opposite end of: 1
wonder if they: 1
saw the implications: 1
standing there laughing: 1
brother percy's pet: 1
- he didn't: 1
then the door: 1
'fair' thing maybe: 1
to argue over: 1
he waited to: 1
of malfoy wouldn't: 1
her rival but: 1
little hard as: 1
later hermione had: 1
what day is: 1
quirrell she asked: 1
light - not: 1
to lose and: 1
of a malfoy: 1
terrible door she: 1
i wonder if: 1
i did my: 1
sabotage a friendly: 1
the table she: 1
said that two: 1
caught all the: 1
it was wednesday: 1
your classes her: 1
she tried to: 1
hermy draco was: 1
is unfit for: 1
became an unregistered: 1
your heart told: 1
he had to: 1
know she has: 1
you know damn: 1
should just attack: 1
earning more points: 1
find something but: 1
against the darkest: 1
and have me: 1
helplessly it was: 1
of my father's: 1
dueled so instead: 1
her stride and: 1
said as much: 1
everything just like: 1
than either of: 1
for finding out: 1
incredibly chaotic and: 1
tried to get: 1
a pound was: 1
you know she: 1
forbid said harry: 1
head in his: 1
what is it: 1
one special exception: 1
the boy-who-lived reading: 1
father and i: 1
him if he'd: 1
i say draco: 1
diagonally and there: 1
professor quirrell tapped: 1
was coming up: 1

you came from: 2
a moment and: 2
his voice was: 2
science that makes: 2
you are not: 2
in his eyes: 2
was staring at: 2

a look of: 2
because that's what: 2
of the dead: 2
of the three: 2
but i would: 2
to die harry: 2
didn't have to: 2
unable to cast: 2
at harry for: 2
said harry the: 2
he thought of: 2
i got off: 2
harry took a: 2
moment and then: 2
if you stood: 2
that wizards could: 2
headmaster said slowly: 2
secret of the: 2
dark lord was: 2
fear of death: 2
something like that: 2
harry for a: 2
is it science: 2
surface of a: 2
allowed to happen: 2
of the resurrection: 2
headmaster the old: 2
things that you: 2
said harry i: 2
i thought that: 2
i will be: 2
i have long: 2
no said the: 2
the dead and: 2
he said quietly: 2
death is a: 2
that i am: 2
i did not: 2
on his forehead: 2
boy with the: 2
it was a: 2
much of a: 2
with only a: 2
me said harry: 2
all sorts of: 2
you must believe: 2
the young boy: 2
what it might: 2
it science that: 2
the fear of: 2
right harry said: 2
it means you: 2
meet them and: 2
the veil you: 2
and ten years: 2
that was when: 2
celebrate my first: 2
live one more: 2
that there was: 2
to believe that: 2
didn't seem like: 2
strange look in: 2
the headmaster wanted: 2
in the old: 2
wanted to hear: 2
harry said coldly: 2
seem like an: 2
that would be: 2
about how the: 2
clear that the: 2
wizard said his: 2
for a moment: 2
to which you: 2
- the headmaster: 2
and that was: 2
out of the: 2
the dementor the: 2
and if you: 2
i am not: 2
of the living: 2
not wish to: 2
off the train: 2
that if you: 2
come up with: 2
the defense professor: 2
of a wizard: 2
tell you the: 2
resurrection stone i: 2
the death of: 2
the headmaster nodded: 2
headmaster wanted to: 2
one who wants: 2
of death is: 2
i asked you: 2
to cast a: 2
you just go: 2
onto the grounds: 2
one had ever: 2
a lot more: 2
i think i: 2
the dementor would: 2
a good thing: 2
the days of: 2
to you that: 2
dark lord's immortality: 2
a great stone: 2
you have any: 2
an afterlife i: 2
his voice the: 2
in the end: 2
you really believed: 2
party on the: 2
only a slight: 2
if professor quirrell: 2
harry and you: 2
faced down the: 2
hundred and ten: 2
death of a: 2
them that i'd: 2
is to be: 2
really believed in: 2
great stone archway: 2
dumbledore stared at: 2
that i was: 2
said harry and: 2
why would anyone: 2
you didn't have: 2
professor quirrell is: 2
that you have: 2
wish to live: 2
with his mouth: 2
but i must: 2
of the dark: 2
shook his head: 2
hit on the: 2
it is the: 2
you have a: 2
from the dead: 2
and then he: 2
dementor would be: 2
a deep breath: 2
by my enemies: 2
of the dementor: 2
the headmaster with: 2
with lucius malfoy: 2
it makes you: 2
in an afterlife: 2
do you have: 2
to be wise: 2
that the headmaster: 2
to see it: 2
understand the dark: 2
in order to: 2
like that harry: 2
a strange look: 2
to live one: 2
being scared of: 2
harry a strange: 2
think it through: 2
got off the: 2
pretending to be: 2
cunning to match: 2
that makes you: 2
is no justice: 2
would not wish: 2
part of yourself: 2
that the dark: 2
order to use: 2
harry said with: 2
be brought in: 2
who died for: 2
you don't want: 2
no justice in: 2
to meet them: 2
a tinge of: 2
on the dementor: 2
afraid of death: 2
tell me what: 2
scar on his: 2
if you really: 2
no one had: 2
the dead -: 2
yes said dumbledore: 2
down at his: 2
took a deep: 2
for some reason: 2
he'd managed to: 2
but if you: 2
back the dead: 2
world of the: 2
more cunning than: 2
pool of water: 2
can you imagine: 2
a great many: 2
in such fashion: 2
the dementor and: 2
this much i: 2
with a truncheon: 2
such fashion that: 2
the dementor is: 2
i want to: 2
of it because: 2
would and that: 1
about it pretty: 1
do wish that: 1
three headmaster harry: 1
the other reason: 1
they were just: 1
define myself by: 1
their wicked minds: 1
dementor were allowed: 1
draco malfoy or: 1
had souls there: 1
of his tongue: 1
to it than: 1
pffft whirr professor: 1
dare exaggerate a: 1
an interesting fraud: 1
splat harry stared: 1
or grow because: 1
students awaiting their: 1
harry please listen: 1
eyebrows rose up: 1
and seek it: 1
when those you: 1
to hold a: 1
life you just: 1
cage with his: 1
the wrong side: 1
could not withstand: 1
neville's parents alice: 1
to find the: 1
try my best: 1
quirrell is unable: 1
what you've seen: 1
good that was: 1
to be fighting: 1
the hurt was: 1
live forever proof: 1
would i know: 1
headmaster to protect: 1
my words instead: 1
hit and you: 1
hadn't read up: 1
laws of physics: 1
than quibbler headlines: 1
was exactly one: 1
the user's mind: 1
comes harry was: 1
reasonable excuse to: 1
voice calm i'll: 1
that i understand: 1
sighed how did: 1
method of immortality: 1
harry raised his: 1
yes the headmaster: 1
man great tell: 1
and run from: 1
of a school: 1
down that bleak: 1
without thinking about: 1
anything i find: 1
is awesome and: 1
mind completely before: 1
they desire but: 1
still live for: 1
call it friendship: 1
pass the darkest: 1
laced with surprise: 1
them that wizards: 1
evil for the: 1
his mouth gaping: 1
and yet others: 1
at all there: 1
wanted the whole: 1
horrified he opened: 1
stone of the: 1
within the part: 1
thing yes well: 1
wizard i understand: 1
more experience than: 1
looking more solemn: 1
and think it: 1
smiling with gentle: 1
slytherin i do: 1
a loss harry: 1
then harry paused: 1
voldemort said the: 1
asked you why: 1
if people had: 1
met at the: 1
desire so desperately: 1
are truly asking: 1
when i knew: 1
looking at harry: 1
trudging across his: 1
concluded that his: 1
making without moon: 1
little helpless and: 1
of philosophers pretending: 1
who wasn't getting: 1
underestimate yourself that: 1
of that obviously: 1
entire point there: 1
office - and: 1
asking you for: 1
so it probably: 1
sounded simply puzzled: 1
don't really want: 1
he insists on: 1
of resentment at: 1
if you listened: 1
my death as: 1
against so while: 1
security so harry: 1
began trudging across: 1
things and the: 1
have heard in: 1
this is insanity: 1
letters a day: 1
through a mysterious: 1
and dark blacker: 1
reason i asked: 1
wizard to go: 1
quirrell's teaching defense: 1
mind is to: 1
by dumbledore who: 1
last thing i: 1
at harry with: 1
done a great: 1
stop himself from: 1
be there myself: 1
was pouring into: 1
somewhere that no: 1
them too and: 1
detailed analysis the: 1
you have taken: 1
in a positive: 1
on harry again: 1
he wanted the: 1
to comprehend evil: 1
how to proceed: 1
most extremely wise: 1
that was his: 1
and hypnotize them: 1
said harry yes: 1
and then the: 1
usual thank you: 1
had protected in: 1
rituals in a: 1
create aliens rendezvous: 1
me in the: 1
by more than: 1
clear in his: 1
while all your: 1
of this world: 1
so harry frowned: 1
the air well: 1
and grim then: 1
cheeks while the: 1
the abyss you: 1
for himself but: 1
to look rather: 1
but her heart: 1
frozen puff of: 1
was trembling you: 1
mild disapproval you: 1
was asking him: 1
moment you touched: 1
should insist on: 1
of mysteries a: 1
story and had: 1
lieutenants and finally: 1
so long that: 1
fiddly things and: 1
i'm always willing: 1
eyes i suppose: 1
honestly dumbledore's face: 1
his mysterious dark: 1
you can call: 1
i would mind: 1
told professor mcgonagall: 1
hard on that: 1
from if professor: 1
the book from: 1
still want to: 1
from professor quirrell: 1
flitwick had silently: 1
that the world: 1
on to their: 1
a gentle laughter: 1
happened actually can: 1
to watch invisibly: 1
obvious thing to: 1
better and that: 1
of protesting i: 1
that dying at: 1
since you didn't: 1
be met at: 1
the pain so: 1
tell me headmaster: 1
to you i: 1
optional guidelines i: 1
said not even: 1
and so harry: 1
i'll answer your: 1
headmaster the pain: 1
know for i: 1
who found all: 1
under highly mysterious: 1
entirely consistent with: 1
years that dying: 1
first place visit: 1
do think that: 1
the tiniest bit: 1
said harry sorry: 1
wizened by time: 1
thing an illness: 1
is when those: 1
grip of his: 1
fury of resentment: 1
opened his mouth: 1
would be in: 1
it is time: 1
to harry's cloak: 1
couldn't see a: 1
alive in the: 1
wizard's voice almost: 1
coldly his own: 1
be a slytherin's: 1
do that it: 1
die because if: 1
worry about finding: 1
irony it seemed: 1
ships which is: 1
flattered me said: 1
an act of: 1
it further than: 1
blood i have: 1
eager to live: 1
define yourself is: 1
his secret it: 1
having to ask: 1
even as he: 1
unbearable that it: 1
headmaster said quietly: 1
aurors at any: 1
the office -: 1
matching without any: 1
soft with a: 1
perhaps the old: 1
stupidly avoidable mistakes: 1
say no and: 1
must wrench you: 1
circle drawn inside: 1
me wish to: 1
is like being: 1
just uttered some: 1
and that he'd: 1
abilities of the: 1
temporary - whether: 1
at least not: 1
intercepted a great: 1
respect the truth: 1
in the grip: 1
headmaster's point of: 1
surprising or come: 1
and all the: 1
the man i: 1
saw them headmaster: 1
sacrificed part of: 1
do understand now: 1
there wouldn't be: 1
that finds that: 1
minerva mcgonagall is: 1
monastery that taught: 1
wanted to start: 1
all cold and: 1
tinkling bells that: 1
they'd just gone: 1
air well said: 1
glass goldfish bowl: 1
stored previously headmaster: 1
heard from again: 1
was permanent or: 1
the equal of: 1
this day you: 1
day the pass: 1
how you must: 1
on all of: 1
think itself master: 1
just go on: 1
you harry stared: 1
understand the nature: 1
bad said harry: 1
slammed shut behind: 1
like science said: 1
nature understand the: 1
from somewhere that: 1
his hands the: 1
run from death: 1
to those without: 1
it is so: 1
you are truly: 1
copy of his: 1
those things like: 1
and had a: 1
am less afraid: 1
sheer pattern matching: 1
was agonized i: 1
with the way: 1
not to go: 1
stood very straight: 1
and so do: 1
foe but yours: 1
himself said dumbledore: 1
pouch at the: 1
to the headmaster: 1
with no awareness: 1
you said harry: 1
the first name: 1
into the chair: 1
fully into his: 1
near just to: 1
they just wouldn't: 1
have seen and: 1
hero or something: 1
lucius malfoy that: 1
sake of horror: 1
too far -: 1
to cast the: 1
it was clear: 1
tell you a: 1
not in fact: 1
a school who: 1
tinge that crept: 1
that he will: 1
did you become: 1
cloak the resurrection: 1
she told me: 1
he was a: 1
at himself for: 1
then write something: 1
to listen is: 1
guesses at all: 1
silhouettes left on: 1
hand a little: 1
said harry by: 1
wizarding world didn't: 1
i could ask: 1
word perhaps the: 1
for monday since: 1
their turn would: 1
to talk and: 1
wise you are: 1
my question said: 1
that last word: 1
more important than: 1
but it was: 1
voldemort to destroy: 1
from ravenclaw for: 1
thought draco malfoy: 1
the night so: 1
him as though: 1
life could also: 1
care that the: 1
wisdom you'd stored: 1
live for whose: 1
himself a tally: 1
professor flitwick had: 1
it's life you: 1
headmaster and so: 1
kill him if: 1
when she told: 1
here and if: 1
that he was: 1
seen that people: 1
immortal harry said: 1
ritual terrible and: 1
way into the: 1
silvery mesh in: 1
soul could go: 1
in souls pretend: 1
what the headmaster: 1
professor quirrell his: 1
his brain state: 1
is insanity bwa: 1
completely in character: 1
and proud and: 1
negentropy but i'm: 1
remembered and that: 1
by sheer pattern: 1
wise knockdown argument: 1
you would be: 1
they knew their: 1
side and that: 1
your comprehension of: 1
when my time: 1
i do that: 1
view said harry: 1
enough to not: 1
harry stared down: 1
positions in the: 1
to not say: 1
monster why do: 1
love yourself so: 1
spell to summon: 1
him the most: 1
wouldn't be satisfied: 1
could understand why: 1
loaded it in: 1
bars not transfigured: 1
and he truly: 1
heir of malfoy: 1
than any before: 1
not ghosts then: 1
the bloody obvious: 1
the way professor: 1
a chance to: 1
a mighty cage: 1
was a tinge: 1
thing as brain: 1
eyes were intent: 1
his head somehow: 1
the sun finally: 1
immortality was born: 1
whatever deep wisdom: 1
like they'd emigrated: 1
said solemnly i: 1
front of the: 1
receive dozens of: 1
which is never: 1
hurts so much: 1
without accusation but: 1
er said harry: 1
wise rather it: 1
in the sort: 1
book from which: 1
time dumbledore would: 1
wizard you've seen: 1
didn't have religion: 1
spiral stairs the: 1
different if we: 1
stone was one: 1
wisdom love is: 1
said politely i: 1
wizard in his: 1
headmaster and now: 1
but i'm a: 1
you may realize: 1
and harry could: 1
i believe that: 1
color i have: 1
way people would: 1
case it wasn't: 1
will be happening: 1
times was the: 1
it dumbledore was: 1
the memory faded: 1
many owls to: 1
but it is: 1
a little black: 1
dumbledore sighed his: 1
harry harry gazed: 1
i will tell: 1
back from the: 1
to die and: 1
i must be: 1
you would receive: 1
wonderful great idea: 1
impressed me greatly: 1
want to understand: 1
to just go: 1
had done with: 1
not reach up: 1
so i should: 1
rage at the: 1
in the history: 1
already was from: 1
most terrible of: 1
i got one: 1
there was an: 1
so while all: 1
taken the most: 1
shouldn't it be: 1
you that it: 1
complete copy of: 1
turned into a: 1
not where they: 1
say that i: 1
and never be: 1
i understand him: 1
be wise as: 1
you become so: 1
seek to refuse: 1
going a little: 1
own beliefs seriously: 1
the heir of: 1
will prove valuable: 1
stronger than you: 1
finished did anyone: 1
than he already: 1
with a tattered: 1
years the old: 1
charm himself said: 1
and sat down: 1
a very strong: 1
st mungo's and: 1
cynicism for wisdom: 1
hufflepuff and the: 1
hint of pain: 1
in a mighty: 1
came voldemort to: 1
a month like: 1
think any thought: 1
the cliche using: 1
on our next: 1
about where to: 1
paced slowly through: 1
than being intelligent: 1
wizard continued a: 1
and i'd already: 1
day you have: 1
be no one: 1
that made him: 1
hope or make: 1
evil why voldemort: 1
and wiped at: 1
step ahead of: 1
darkish and came: 1
death so greatly: 1
rituals so he: 1
mark for monday: 1
forehead who didn't: 1
slowly pace through: 1
warped voldemort is: 1
get into trouble: 1
quirrell usually acts: 1
as deep as: 1
clarity and then: 1
him to interact: 1
it is us: 1
ding glorp pop: 1
hypothesis was that: 1
about nailing the: 1
volunteered that fact: 1
dying at two: 1
made small musical: 1
sky but they: 1
which you turn: 1
because i'm the: 1
if you give: 1
will be with: 1
indignation seems like: 1
at the bottom: 1
himself i should: 1
i'm not evil: 1
his tongue fast: 1
must believe there: 1
selfish bastard who: 1
of professor flitwick: 1
softly as though: 1
wizard said peacefully: 1
percival wulfric brian: 1
into his voice: 1
and send it: 1
these are things: 1
said quietly not: 1
same the headmaster: 1
to die because: 1
have imagined sharpening: 1
an indecipherable script: 1
pretend that nobody: 1
crazy headmaster of: 1
culture where people: 1
bones into weapons: 1
voice since that: 1
in the equations: 1
wonder and regret: 1
that said harry: 1
longbottom so they: 1
so unbearable that: 1
a folded parchment: 1
he gleaned his: 1
darkest of all: 1
eyes of which: 1
for things you: 1
hasten the day: 1
that you must: 1
on that last: 1
of incommensurability i: 1
if you went: 1
only turned them: 1
live-fire tests under: 1
morning harry looked: 1
to hear as: 1
one or the: 1
dressed in pajamas: 1
you just don't: 1
into trouble and: 1
had silently passed: 1
a very reasonable: 1
professor quirrell's shoes: 1
don't see why: 1
there's this little: 1
come out a: 1
last shriek the: 1
credulity it wasn't: 1
ha said harry: 1
it the numerals: 1
was just going: 1
theory said the: 1
exists in the: 1
they lay in: 1
people were hit: 1
crackle fzzzt albus: 1
from memory then: 1
world if hitler: 1
that down headmaster: 1
the crystal ball: 1
harry's cloak the: 1
of the universe: 1
little wizened by: 1
devices first do: 1
headmaster in surprise: 1
been maybe it: 1
harry said not: 1
as friendship is: 1
harry said now: 1
would anyone possibly: 1
that crept up: 1
in fact it: 1
a method of: 1
by smiling with: 1
common sense inside: 1
death life is: 1
each other's eyes: 1
i wished to: 1
deep breath sank: 1
the world and: 1
also clear that: 1
act of grace: 1
went on and: 1
wizards didn't have: 1
where people were: 1
worried i can: 1
harry understand what: 1
on reading the: 1
he's got a: 1
a month and: 1
me not at: 1
have to rationalize: 1
suspicious the headmaster: 1
the unlikely event: 1
he was trying: 1
best to anticipate: 1
that death is: 1
cast a corporeal: 1
both thank you: 1
made stupidly avoidable: 1
headmaster that you: 1
would be sucked: 1
fear is sorely: 1
he sank into: 1
the headmaster you: 1
example call back: 1
wasn't getting hit: 1
don't know what: 1
not say that: 1
he should insist: 1
further than any: 1
i am greatly: 1
you seek the: 1
wizard with only: 1
was gentle his: 1
to be guarded: 1

like a frozen: 1
dividing them both: 1
somewhere else if: 1
wizard sounded sad: 1

amazing benefits to: 1
tomorrow i will: 1

door slammed shut: 1
headmaster said reluctantly: 1

friend that makes: 1
friendship if you: 1
face was peaceful: 1
and tell them: 1
malfoy henceforth did: 1
any other evidence: 1
meet my parents: 1

headmaster i'd never: 1
gives you away: 1
to be the: 1
harry asked if: 1
seem like much: 1
came up with: 1
stone archway kept: 1
in the days: 1
at him sternly: 1
so he did: 1
students was still: 1
patronus and the: 1
the word leliel: 1
said the coldness: 1
a little wearily: 1
time-turned as his: 1
- so tell: 1
thought that wizards: 1
away you seek: 1
he could and: 1
something odd about: 1
with his lieutenants: 1
inside and back: 1
to die i: 1
good thing because: 1
at his hands: 1
the soul by: 1
a monster no: 1
at any time: 1
of problem but: 1
would wait by: 1
understand what voldemort: 1
said it perhaps: 1
hopes dashed someone: 1
all of his: 1
vibrating from his: 1
and call it: 1
puff tinkle bubble: 1
alice and frank: 1
self faced down: 1
do just one: 1
he should have: 1
tinkle bubble beep: 1
flames looked into: 1
teach the patronus: 1
this universe before: 1
with surprise and: 1
far from sure: 1
harry would go: 1
startled pause slowly: 1
hallows a triangle: 1
you ask me: 1
as he faced: 1
teach us anything: 1
happens thought harry: 1
sweet myrtle who: 1
learn or grow: 1
in the way: 1
to look for: 1
in the war: 1
that had ever: 1
i thought there: 1
itself master of: 1
wizard harry said: 1
down immediately afterward: 1
up the hairs: 1
for a time: 1
world's most powerful: 1
it out later: 1
by the death: 1
also not interesting: 1
knockdown argument now: 1
or stretched things: 1
as he said: 1
the silver-bearded figure: 1
me i fear: 1
grim then look: 1
with the dead: 1
of comprehension growing: 1
about it i: 1
and in that: 1
left on the: 1
and you harry: 1
was still there: 1
by saying this: 1
but back in: 1
stood there and: 1
you were evil: 1
one with the: 1
test the limits: 1
about it -: 1
to the dementor: 1
rituals maybe in: 1
be evil the: 1
trailed off why: 1
of course only: 1
to pay the: 1
fumbled through a: 1
i thought no: 1
the whole history: 1
don't have to: 1
shut behind him: 1
a sternness in: 1
by an auror: 1
with those i: 1
something yes said: 1
against the silvery: 1
anything it touched: 1
month and no: 1
his lap maybe: 1
so young the: 1
headmaster was staring: 1
to live headmaster: 1
for all of: 1
transfigured but true-forged: 1
name and test: 1
to go on: 1
grindelwald was my: 1
to and instead: 1
soundlessly through the: 1
smoke a painful: 1
to escape this: 1
wizard was still: 1
quite serious the: 1
there was still: 1
killing people that: 1
the right thing: 1
his office and: 1
call souls back: 1
be something more: 1
to say that: 1
what dumbledore wanted: 1
wise harry the: 1
harry with his: 1
become evil but: 1
been different if: 1
at his convenience: 1
to destroy everything: 1
had finished up: 1
stared off into: 1
understand him now: 1
well sounding wise: 1
was a great: 1
the history of: 1
the sky but: 1
look within the: 1
professor quirrell means: 1
the world ran: 1
over a fiddly: 1
only dark wizard: 1
elevate themselves it: 1
put it that: 1
thought of the: 1
have the same: 1
will do the: 1
thing that would: 1
old wizard sounded: 1
kindness as friendship: 1
like to watch: 1
headmaster his voice: 1
ask me for: 1
do something evil: 1
would notice especially: 1
to elevate themselves: 1
of universe where: 1
case harry ought: 1
a bitter thing: 1
anything left of: 1
tragedies weren't allowed: 1
extremely bad being: 1
no no this: 1
finished his recollections: 1
list of things: 1
worlds was a: 1
all down immediately: 1
to help me: 1
each time i: 1
to be something: 1
to bring in: 1
would be squeamish: 1
dead or just: 1
if a dementor: 1
large and comfortable: 1
while there were: 1
weren't allowed to: 1
veil harry reached: 1
his convenience and: 1
this disbelief may: 1
rippling always from: 1
pain so you: 1
lord doesn't seem: 1
you probably think: 1
as harry went: 1
thought hurts so: 1
glorp pop bubble: 1
you happier on: 1
except for equally: 1
with harry's ability: 1
if i could: 1
harry awarded himself: 1
die and that: 1
stars it is: 1
like an evil: 1
said dumbledore smiling: 1
have lived a: 1
at his cheeks: 1
he'd wanted to: 1
to die you've: 1
to numb the: 1
consult harry suppressed: 1
rather it is: 1
from laughing and: 1
said coldly i'll: 1
trailed off harry: 1
understand love without: 1
care or the: 1
embrace death as: 1
go around telling: 1
regret being alive: 1
it said the: 1
any time pretend: 1
your point of: 1
was obvious the: 1
truly believed it: 1
is something i: 1
that i wished: 1
their allotted span: 1
voice why would: 1
anywhere - i: 1
because you don't: 1
prevent from happening: 1
the headmaster shook: 1
to mask the: 1
and regret in: 1
check off before: 1
stay dumbledore's eyes: 1
that made small: 1
would pass the: 1
the boy bowed: 1
genius transfiguration said: 1
- what said: 1
all your attention: 1
to write it: 1
gave a slow: 1
appeared to be: 1
dark mark on: 1
and that i'd: 1
not come to: 1
want everyone to: 1
who from i: 1
reluctant to perform: 1
must ask if: 1
had cunning to: 1
that question no: 1
my mother and: 1
a lunatic asylum: 1
and he killed: 1
was clear that: 1
was that i: 1
said harry discarding: 1
should just shut: 1
that subjunctive case: 1
was not there: 1
dark lord which: 1
does not in: 1
said dumbledore shaking: 1
muttered the other: 1
down it was: 1
surely you wrote: 1
to keep an: 1
found some way: 1
definitely a bad: 1
if i would: 1
mean those things: 1
doesn't seem like: 1
this little thing: 1
and does not: 1
things too many: 1
enveloped as he: 1
eyes why do: 1
change everything it: 1
drawing of professor: 1
death better than: 1
did anyone do: 1
boy stood very: 1
the scar on: 1
it an even: 1
the dementor through: 1
dozens of letters: 1
and controlled as: 1
well back of: 1
life remaining for: 1
harry harry took: 1
in the course: 1
had concluded that: 1
was giving harry: 1
now he insists: 1
much considering that: 1
that harry finished: 1
uttered some kind: 1
in exchange for: 1
that i fear: 1
edge of the: 1
kindle warmth in: 1
did something really: 1
you for it: 1
pass was permanent: 1
of putting them: 1
another question for: 1
harry let me: 1
mistake cynicism for: 1
those letters the: 1
the student harry: 1
took his own: 1
mcgonagall when she: 1
kept himself from: 1
jumped to conclusions: 1
open he was: 1
all muggles too: 1
bound to help: 1
and what it: 1
gravely and said: 1
more began trudging: 1
they touched it: 1
destined foe but: 1
points no let: 1
that elementary logical: 1
am at a: 1
to focus on: 1
back to 6pm: 1
the chair and: 1
and their allotted: 1
themselves thought harry: 1
interact with lucius: 1
her lost earring: 1
snowballed there is: 1
soul the old: 1
i knew that: 1
transported to the: 1
i did something: 1
himself but there: 1
his immortality took: 1
of negentropy but: 1
that vanished anything: 1
dark lord survived: 1
hurt or an: 1
other's eyes the: 1
you have helped: 1
have your heart: 1
in a dementor: 1
open dumbly harry: 1
older slytherins the: 1
soberly you are: 1
a slow nod: 1
tell them that: 1
universe is neither: 1
expense himself if: 1
about their sacrifice: 1
years would be: 1
character said the: 1
be convinced if: 1
it the boy: 1
and you asked: 1
himself enveloped as: 1
him mad and: 1
charm to every: 1
original question then: 1
unnoticed had drifted: 1
password for the: 1
instead of protesting: 1
glittered in the: 1
temptation to believe: 1
lost someone in: 1
for him now: 1
lucius malfoy notes: 1
completely flabbergasted harry: 1
a patronus charm: 1
painful desperation in: 1
unable to see: 1
not believe it: 1
you here said: 1
pay the expense: 1
of physics are: 1
the head with: 1
do anything about: 1
move on there: 1
he saw it: 1
i dispel my: 1
whole brain was: 1
said harry am: 1
be sure more: 1
far outside this: 1
any such thing: 1
quirrell believes very: 1
frank longbottom so: 1
she didn't act: 1
part of myself: 1
focus on harry: 1
earth to watch: 1
a dark mirror: 1
numerous if you: 1
you give me: 1
still staring at: 1
ding puff splat: 1
a strange wonder: 1
headmaster of their: 1
puzzlement crossed the: 1
until a hundred: 1
the world is: 1
i do understand: 1
a monster and: 1
that same part: 1
first but then: 1
harry sorry i've: 1
warmth in draco: 1
owls from him: 1
never a good: 1
how the dementor: 1
am i supposed: 1
you no wisdom: 1
mad and he: 1
them back to: 1
life accidentally impressed: 1
so listen then: 1
headmaster had seen: 1
dignity and so: 1
outraged as he: 1
resurrection stone has: 1
too long you: 1
call back -: 1
find out later: 1
any guesses at: 1
blinked and at: 1
harry wasn't feeling: 1
professor quirrell than: 1
you have with: 1
have intercepted a: 1
be evil and: 1
x die x: 1
tinge of annoyance: 1
hold him back: 1
put a clearly: 1
or life accidentally: 1
too late to: 1
hand trailed through: 1
i had protected: 1
one-time password for: 1
said dumbledore death: 1
rules of nature: 1
of course harry: 1
before you and: 1
senders undelivered but: 1
other evidence dumbledore: 1
it that vanished: 1
must stay dumbledore's: 1
to understand the: 1
sympathize with the: 1
the possibly-crazy headmaster: 1
began to slowly: 1
the dementor will: 1
would be an: 1
therefore always in: 1
look of puzzlement: 1
will still want: 1
been allowed into: 1
me much harry: 1
wouldn't happen in: 1
said quietly taking: 1
did not have: 1
reason harry wasn't: 1
you loved the: 1
phrase the rejoinder: 1
a little story: 1
believe that the: 1
stand for the: 1
as to imagine: 1
into something approaching: 1
do the right: 1
point there was: 1
that taught the: 1
professor flitwick would: 1
which people are: 1
well without yet: 1
the living and: 1
projecting an image: 1
high and proud: 1
it comes harry: 1
like much of: 1
sad as he: 1
yourself that was: 1
imagine love and: 1
harry why did: 1
damage to the: 1
light but flee: 1
magic that accompanies: 1
by the veil: 1
do you mean: 1
and coming to: 1
would seem just: 1
afterimages burned into: 1
said with calm: 1
don't understand why: 1
they belong souls: 1
to draw forth: 1
europe would have: 1
deeply wise than: 1
something really dumb: 1
i cannot think: 1
know said harry: 1
may have not: 1
for it but: 1
died for me: 1
smart to just: 1
harry frowned then: 1
then the old: 1
actually can you: 1
side as deep: 1
little i won't: 1
i must ask: 1
much on his: 1
harry there has: 1
say that would: 1
passed on that: 1
question then you: 1
happening elsewhere dumbledore: 1
wonder what will: 1
of hogwarts by: 1
it was obvious: 1
thought no one: 1
go on speaking: 1
looked down at: 1
fixed on harry: 1
my foes to: 1
childish innocence he: 1
greatly but now: 1
not transfigured but: 1
to me said: 1
sighed his fingers: 1
mourn me too: 1
his eyes why: 1
by dumbledore's credulity: 1
character for him: 1
yourself is science: 1
little too far: 1
i wish i: 1
nor live on: 1
intelligent actually since: 1
trying to mask: 1
it even for: 1
was temporary replied: 1
headmaster's eyebrows rose: 1
muttered this is: 1
time you ask: 1
would not this: 1
took murder -: 1
but he didn't: 1
monster - no: 1
of puzzlement crossed: 1
or the other: 1
a stone archway: 1
from his pouch: 1
just wouldn't happen: 1
it doesn't sound: 1
be sure to: 1
exists as more: 1
cold and darkish: 1
internal debate about: 1
so you have: 1
nod yes said: 1
you turn when: 1
to living four: 1
my own great: 1
actually happened actually: 1
go ahead and: 1
know and this: 1
something i have: 1
you cannot give: 1
him back and: 1
this country did: 1
on harry and: 1
across a vast: 1
and so there: 1
no one else: 1
that my parents: 1
voice was soft: 1
headmaster would have: 1
listened too long: 1
induction on the: 1
of silence that: 1
remember the old: 1
- then you: 1
guarded dumbledore's eyebrows: 1
justice in the: 1
was scared of: 1
somehow even in: 1
got here when: 1
staring at harry: 1
a slight twist: 1
people and hypnotize: 1
is a dreadful: 1
and professor mcgonagall: 1
do the same: 1
test like that: 1
be done but: 1
you could try: 1
do that i: 1
none of that: 1
will become of: 1
am greatly misunderstood: 1
are so driven: 1
doesn't even sound: 1
loudly right now: 1
the obvious test: 1
fangs it actually: 1
their evil thoughts: 1
there's this muggle: 1
whistle tick bzzzt: 1
cozen up to: 1
that snowballed there: 1
puff splat harry: 1
to respect the: 1
days of your: 1
like going a: 1
stone archway made: 1
see why you're: 1
deep wisdom you'd: 1
barrier between worlds: 1
that you check: 1
sudden realization you: 1
bitter thing an: 1
while the glass: 1
had ever said: 1
the head of: 1
pattern-matching software complete: 1
them back into: 1
have to your: 1
the first time: 1
a suicide prevention: 1
appeared in different: 1
as you run: 1
of all the: 1
better than i: 1
blackmailing zabini for: 1
incommensurability i have: 1
his answer would: 1
know anything about: 1
shoes what misdeeds: 1
to worry about: 1
it touched and: 1
i may have: 1
a great deal: 1
what to say: 1
the cloak of: 1
something that had: 1
face was tight: 1
them here and: 1
he did more: 1
or the sky: 1
tell me about: 1
be to write: 1
from the constant: 1
defeat the dark: 1
to kindle warmth: 1
between worlds was: 1
this way do: 1
a tally mark: 1
- or perhaps: 1
thing because you're: 1
does anyone know: 1
off into nothingness: 1
to magically understand: 1
to mind your: 1
office i know: 1
despite his smile: 1
heart broken six: 1
taking his beard: 1
why dumbledore wouldn't: 1
without any sort: 1
you're not afraid: 1
patronus before the: 1
if they actually: 1
was a kind: 1
were really dead: 1
of amazing benefits: 1
into his mind: 1
and that will: 1
nodded for some: 1
classmates and i: 1
that you understand: 1
the nature of: 1
the stones rippling: 1
the left cerebral: 1
and in case: 1
slowly i do: 1
his mind a: 1
four hundred years: 1
harry hadn't read: 1
imagine what a: 1
blurted harry surely: 1
an afterlife you'd: 1
put it who: 1
i do wish: 1
stone i got: 1
the surface of: 1
prevention hotline -: 1
seen ghosts ghosts: 1
trembling you know: 1
voice harry was: 1
hands briefly appeared: 1
had only zabini's: 1
ask that young: 1
darkness at its: 1
student harry poked: 1
are merely pretending: 1
because you're afraid: 1
had paced to: 1
a slight tremble: 1
of the barrier: 1
of the castle: 1
told harry to: 1
like it makes: 1
smiling slightly i: 1
also sounded incredibly: 1
like an interesting: 1
makes the gryffindor: 1
so there's this: 1
suppressed the chill: 1
sacrifice it took: 1
thing i would: 1
glorp pop splat: 1
believe tell me: 1
hand yes the: 1
you believe in: 1
start in exchange: 1
time but still: 1
more day therefore: 1
professor has asked: 1
in all politeness: 1
wizard's eyes he: 1
why you are: 1
of consciousness find: 1
he hurt or: 1
you just let: 1
chair closed his: 1
makes you tougher: 1
harry to draw: 1
you to avoid: 1
puff of smoke: 1
dementor said harry: 1
solemn despite his: 1
harry reached up: 1
tricked me into: 1
unique genius transfiguration: 1
the dead or: 1
sounded incredibly wise: 1
be in a: 1
let's not forget: 1
time comes i: 1
verify the existence: 1
no ritual requiring: 1
that will succeed: 1
it out loud: 1
to get wrinkled: 1
makes the scientist: 1
it he was: 1
never seen a: 1
and i believe: 1
metal to dust: 1
given in to: 1
midst of all: 1
is not where: 1
pop bubble -: 1
out your evidence: 1
stone i would: 1
angry for having: 1
or done and: 1
i wasn't expecting: 1
everything at least: 1

to people who'd: 1
kept in the: 1
water that made: 1

something even better: 1
extremely wise for: 1

office stopped vibrating: 1
old and tall: 1

stone is really: 1
to tell him: 1
seconds because if: 1

said soberly you: 1
wicked minds and: 1
dark mirror to: 1

love something then: 1
to hasten the: 1
direction harry stared: 1
wizard and his: 1
from that direction: 1
calm dignity and: 1
who was born: 1
of the silliest: 1
day some from: 1
to hear it: 1
cunning than professor: 1
giving harry a: 1
key for his: 1
his voice rose: 1
sad look in: 1

into weapons was: 1
what misdeeds could: 1
truth and seek: 1
harry but i: 1
this world for: 1

you may be: 1
to be convinced: 1
silence that had: 1

will grow to: 1
probably just a: 1
why just you: 1
almost halfway through: 1
feel flattered me: 1
headmaster that if: 1

how the rhythm: 1
you can imagine: 1
if you'd just: 1
have been different: 1
is bad said: 1

he who i: 1
a celebrity harry: 1
put it this: 1
to summon them: 1
voice of common: 1
wibble's family to: 1
the world's most: 1
known i should: 1
actually took his: 1
grounds by dumbledore: 1
fiddly thing like: 1
brain damage if: 1
deathly hallows kin: 1
strange office i: 1
eternity harry harry: 1
until he saw: 1
indicate that you: 1
going somewhere else: 1
and right now: 1
that got him: 1
right now even: 1
like the others: 1
more to it: 1
proud and said: 1

harry said after: 1
else would notice: 1
his shoes he: 1
your hesitation gives: 1
fashion that no: 1
you understand dark: 1
seen a ghost: 1
that bleak road: 1
or it makes: 1
matter that everyone: 1
harry was finding: 1
beyond the reasoning: 1
the explanation went: 1
indeed harry stood: 1
and eventually cease: 1
slight tremble in: 1
an auror trio: 1
being one yourself: 1
the other children: 1
hastily for something: 1
out the color: 1
old fools had: 1
cast the patronus: 1
nor good it: 1
thing to do: 1
mark on all: 1
think i do: 1
it than just: 1
a vast gap: 1
had never seen: 1
made myself clear: 1
his good side: 1
and was slowly: 1
i went to: 1
asked if the: 1
the power of: 1
outwit him he's: 1
of your life: 1
all creatures through: 1
deeper harry's mind: 1
a painful desperation: 1
at last because: 1
irony and departed: 1
in live-fire tests: 1
talk to and: 1
but you tell: 1
you and yet: 1
slytherin blackmailing his: 1
souls are meant: 1
sense and does: 1
greatly harry when: 1
why you're suspicious: 1
fonder of professor: 1
a wizard -: 1
to you so: 1
pet hero had: 1
still don't understand: 1
solemnly i would: 1
actual dementor is: 1
but they don't: 1
old and eventually: 1
in the air: 1
yours so if: 1
an idiot who: 1
rather fonder of: 1
tarry until a: 1
was tight with: 1
what a terrible: 1
that metal to: 1
veil what of: 1
become so wise: 1
which wasn't asking: 1
nothing there to: 1
since he'd managed: 1
in his blood: 1
a wooden stool: 1
excuse a very: 1
everything you know: 1
you know the: 1
land of the: 1
no one could: 1
old wizard shaking: 1
to hear the: 1
harry said wearily: 1
the note had: 1
he even still: 1
in this world: 1
whirr bzzzt tick: 1
that harry hadn't: 1
protesting i say: 1
of the deathly: 1
stood up out: 1
said coldly his: 1
afterlife you'd go: 1
voice the cold: 1
before it ran: 1
you waiting by: 1
a triangle with: 1
whisper to people: 1
convenience and in: 1
of hogwarts i: 1
you tell me: 1
test that had: 1
day tomorrow i: 1
you'd stored previously: 1
built a stone: 1
lost for centuries: 1
understood very well: 1
still knowing love: 1
said his face: 1
old wizard in: 1
over to his: 1
dumbledore's eyes were: 1
that harry said: 1
sat down it: 1
it all down: 1
understand how you: 1
art he'd wanted: 1
are overly impressed: 1
the devices which: 1
single day students: 1
still remembered what: 1
take the best: 1
thing called cognitive: 1
evidence but don't: 1
faintly drawn against: 1
of immortality that: 1
headmaster was giving: 1
learn the deepest: 1
was a hundred: 1
huge significant reasons: 1
hogwarts i must: 1
of smoke a: 1
that harry had: 1
i know not: 1
doesn't mean anything: 1
coldness clear in: 1
up with any: 1
and then gave: 1
but don't you: 1
away do something: 1
now that you: 1
die it means: 1
asked or rather: 1
his forehead tell: 1
i'm not going: 1
whole history of: 1
tiny bit of: 1
a story and: 1
it developed that: 1
a crystalline glass: 1
the gargoyle the: 1
doesn't sound good: 1
on after they: 1
then reluctantly nodded: 1
though i fear: 1
harry he was: 1
a wizard you've: 1
done but perhaps: 1
than lucius malfoy: 1
consciousness find out: 1
in different positions: 1
fact to me: 1
dumbledore's credulity it: 1
peverell used the: 1
why did he: 1
okay said harry: 1
blacker than pitchest: 1
so that it: 1
and the ambition: 1
you accomplish after: 1
some way of: 1
monster and you: 1
hiroshima and i: 1
a test like: 1
and i find: 1
and there was: 1
right thing by: 1
but in the: 1
that i'm the: 1
of little fiddly: 1
a young man: 1
on the dark: 1
began to speak: 1
a newsroom wall: 1
a hand in: 1
destined foe the: 1
more in all: 1
hadn't the tiniest: 1
a single day: 1
tick crackle fzzzt: 1
anyone could verify: 1
malfoy or professor: 1
to it try: 1
not without thinking: 1
in his childish: 1
said harry a: 1
imagine not being: 1
turn would stay: 1
same dementor again: 1
would be to: 1
to see if: 1
evil and i: 1
department of mysteries: 1
murder innocents and: 1
forever harry yes: 1
you have answered: 1
because if people: 1
could also be: 1
only that i: 1
the universe which: 1
so greatly er: 1
a sad expression: 1
that you can: 1
me who from: 1
because it was: 1
easy to sympathize: 1
it is a: 1
to go any: 1
the fury coming: 1
for his ambition: 1
finished up transfiguration: 1
up to something: 1
you the truth: 1
as it is: 1
the laughter that: 1
or come up: 1
i jumped to: 1
through the devices: 1
greatly er said: 1
and dares not: 1
sorely lacking the: 1
dark wizards on: 1
how does anyone: 1
the veil said: 1
would soften the: 1
comprehension growing louder: 1
act if they: 1
by wizards who: 1
to tarry until: 1
was a large: 1
into the world: 1
even once because: 1
ask her where: 1
makes the hufflepuff: 1
think so do: 1
evidence for an: 1
sacrifice and that: 1
lately harry had: 1
the tiniest clue: 1
plain now in: 1
gone on before: 1
you just uttered: 1
that to harry: 1
have another question: 1
deep breath meet: 1
for me and: 1
while one of: 1
said dumbledore frowning: 1
i remember the: 1
would be met: 1
there and stared: 1
place visit other: 1
wanted and expected: 1
resentment at dumbledore's: 1
headmaster's direction harry: 1
know that said: 1
stored memories and: 1
and the student: 1
to their senders: 1
rings of saturn: 1
harry had intended: 1
knowing love yourself: 1
at the name: 1
wizards on that: 1
that would soften: 1
going to be: 1
the temptation to: 1
i must wrench: 1
more day tomorrow: 1
he was never: 1
would be entirely: 1
a monster why: 1
my enemies harry: 1
headmaster's desk and: 1
disbelief may do: 1
zabini was wildly: 1
ask a question: 1
the grip of: 1
user's mind is: 1
was starting to: 1
before my friends: 1
through one step: 1
it for yourself: 1
hear it also: 1
be honest and: 1
the room full: 1
than i was: 1
no life remaining: 1
to we care: 1
anything i'm saying: 1
through here am: 1
he was so: 1
and i suggested: 1
of the note: 1
it try to: 1
three times was: 1
water stretched between: 1
said harry it's: 1
that anyone could: 1
in professor quirrell's: 1
calling always calling: 1
at the headmaster's: 1
hints you didn't: 1
me about how: 1
saying not understand: 1
maintained by two: 1
agonized i can't: 1
politely i shall: 1
finite list of: 1
harry what evil: 1
is always in: 1
bring in the: 1
that doesn't sound: 1
be a little: 1
harry's ability to: 1
the headmaster blackmailing: 1
present while there: 1
milky way once: 1
just to add: 1
i thought i: 1
so stupid i: 1
and in such: 1
mean said harry: 1
that it also: 1
completed by sheer: 1
thing is you: 1
slaughtered the entire: 1
not they stood: 1
not as they: 1
frowning but it: 1
speak the dementor: 1
which had better: 1
that so i: 1
friend and cozen: 1
agree disagreements aside: 1
seemed to hold: 1
you can twist: 1
parents had died: 1
to sympathize with: 1
and fifty said: 1
was a gentle: 1
not the only: 1
that was what: 1
against an actual: 1
me hauled right: 1
was from somewhere: 1
who didn't care: 1
thinking about it: 1
to an indecipherable: 1
a strange thing: 1
now his voice: 1
growing sharp repeated: 1
for them here: 1
i given in: 1
a spot where: 1
bells that you: 1
i'm the hero: 1
his voice growing: 1
all x die: 1
had ever sunk: 1
straightforward and easy: 1
circumstances and well: 1
devices which is: 1
bottom of the: 1
but first headmaster: 1
why should there: 1
raised high and: 1
heavy irony and: 1
a corporeal patronus: 1
on the walls: 1
significant hints you: 1
good person and: 1
the name frowned: 1
voice now hard: 1
a darker and: 1
of all evils: 1
i saw them: 1
for very much: 1
was suddenly far: 1
seriousness and without: 1
outwit professor quirrell: 1
of nature understand: 1
x not die: 1
harry could understand: 1
shouldn't have believed: 1
one who thinks: 1
harry how could: 1
really is -: 1
unique genius said: 1
not ravenclaw harry: 1
wildly untrustworthy in: 1
give i have: 1
harry said firmly: 1
but now he: 1
who thought the: 1
left arms and: 1
as though to: 1
to do one: 1
harry muttered the: 1
pitchest black and: 1
not begun to: 1
hard to see: 1
last because to: 1
it actually makes: 1
him a sternness: 1
on the head: 1
you a hug: 1
i know what: 1
his voice harry: 1
person would and: 1
from sure that: 1
i've discovered the: 1
dementor - headmaster: 1
that unique genius: 1
voice why not: 1
reach up toward: 1
all the days: 1
i got the: 1
out the window: 1
just a little: 1
his one-time password: 1
is useful to: 1
to be immortal: 1
themselves it is: 1
they fear death: 1
reluctantly the obvious: 1
i've got to: 1
it when it: 1
his throne began: 1
imagined sharpening a: 1
the annihilation of: 1
charm they would: 1
like a wounded: 1
tremble in his: 1
the headmaster wouldn't: 1
to myself yet: 1
and stretched his: 1
him to outwit: 1
think i would: 1
student would attempt: 1
he loaded it: 1
king's cross i: 1
hogwarts hold on: 1
headmaster gazed at: 1
very loudly right: 1
i suggest you: 1
the words and: 1
it friendship if: 1
saw it faintly: 1
the other i'm: 1
laughter that wise: 1
out loud all: 1
for centuries harry: 1
popularize a method: 1
himself harry the: 1
him i suppose: 1
pouring into his: 1
- well obviously: 1
harry went all: 1
write it all: 1
right now he: 1
wizards are not: 1
hundred years would: 1
you do with: 1
lied but dumbledore: 1
bad being scared: 1
a daze trudged: 1
creative - i: 1
my parents had: 1
of thing dumbledore: 1
wise wasn't difficult: 1
into each other's: 1
they do not: 1
question said dumbledore: 1
stairs the wooden: 1
cried at funerals: 1
dark lord yet: 1
and finally when: 1
back into the: 1
bit disappointed by: 1
to think about: 1
calculate things out: 1
to see why: 1
i was scared: 1
his face was: 1
voice sounded simply: 1
at dumbledore's condescension: 1
been defined by: 1
never be heard: 1
perhaps i am: 1
was really fine: 1
it though i: 1
with the night: 1
letters and judging: 1
who wants to: 1
points from ravenclaw: 1
flees not from: 1
very well without: 1
wizards could do: 1
shake out the: 1
sad but not: 1
his voice rising: 1
burned into the: 1
if the resurrection: 1
hard and grim: 1
and then write: 1
act like they'd: 1
want anyone to: 1
got a lot: 1
chime toot puff: 1
what said dumbledore: 1
harry had already: 1
your moral compass: 1
dementor will be: 1
so harry the: 1
cognitive dissonance or: 1
yet others still: 1
rather demanded that: 1
the dead but: 1
thoughts but i: 1
after they learned: 1
blow someone's mind: 1
seek it all: 1
to conclusions i: 1
wizard's voice was: 1
class and studied: 1
can understand how: 1
dumbledore would wait: 1
is the foe: 1
reasons i'm sorry: 1
wise to say: 1
you intercept owls: 1
his fingers drummed: 1
wizard like the: 1
have survived the: 1
thing you know: 1
with eternity harry: 1
own headmaster to: 1
sank further into: 1
myself uh huh: 1
have with you: 1
that the heir: 1
seemingly unable to: 1
drawn against the: 1
gone away on: 1
have known without: 1
to happen for: 1
what ill could: 1
rose from his: 1
dumbledore's eyebrows rose: 1
boy in his: 1
harry i mean: 1
headmaster it is: 1
dementor behind two: 1
tell me who: 1
motion the universe: 1
the story that: 1
harry suppressed the: 1
of malfoy does: 1
funny thing you: 1
helplessness harry the: 1
said wearily i: 1
have been had: 1
a soul and: 1
the day nor: 1
struggle within himself: 1
way professor quirrell: 1
grow because this: 1
turn when you: 1
wrong side of: 1
believed in souls: 1
no wisdom to: 1
of invisibility from: 1
as that death: 1
was a story: 1
granger will it: 1
the surrounding material: 1
save that i: 1
in the beginning: 1
go on living: 1
to move on: 1
late to try: 1
you'd just fumbled: 1
some kind of: 1
sternly that doesn't: 1
then you can: 1
not in a: 1
called it good: 1
was frowning his: 1
immortality took sacrifice: 1
but i think: 1
and the other: 1
became a monster: 1
anyone had ever: 1
become of you: 1
ambition that makes: 1
have to die: 1
and how does: 1
student who wished: 1
do not comprehend: 1
you i don't: 1
another corporeal patronus: 1
it was screaming: 1
his voice is: 1
the sun's light: 1
that didn't seem: 1
that it just: 1
the notes of: 1
his childish innocence: 1
just optional guidelines: 1
incredulity in his: 1
who mistake cynicism: 1
headmaster said starting: 1
in something of: 1
the note underlined: 1
know but the: 1
through the room: 1
very much considering: 1
have believed it: 1
here when i: 1
accepted my death: 1
harry said politely: 1
forgive you for: 1
monster with poisonous: 1
scared of death: 1
him a sad: 1
it seems a: 1
plainer english sour: 1
dementor the real: 1
than professor quirrell: 1
and the strange: 1
said after some: 1
destiny behind the: 1
is - the: 1
if they had: 1
night into infinitely: 1
to a sharp: 1
draco malfoy's heart: 1
was that the: 1
between it that: 1
stirred it though: 1
went to look: 1
that it would: 1
and i do: 1
of a darker: 1
dumbledore had concluded: 1
tempting about nailing: 1
ghosts ghosts harry: 1
and warped voldemort: 1
have been maybe: 1
aside what is: 1
mouth to speak: 1
though not as: 1
skins of yermy: 1
a plate inscribed: 1
hear the old: 1
question harry said: 1
easier than being: 1
of darkness at: 1
managed to stop: 1
sort of universe: 1
going to popularize: 1
of course the: 1
sad do not: 1
ever could while: 1
nodded gravely and: 1
something approaching deadly: 1
headmaster you name: 1
still near the: 1
benefits they'd say: 1
things were only: 1
asking you harry: 1
the two cultures: 1
mother and father: 1
talking and it: 1
but it sacrificed: 1
sense i do: 1
old wizard continued: 1
his voice a: 1
focused on the: 1
be science to: 1
me what you: 1
talk to people: 1
and more sober: 1
reasoning abilities of: 1
not going to: 1
make him hope: 1
from his hand: 1
dumbledore just stood: 1
works on that: 1
seen the physical: 1
merely pretending to: 1
when it comes: 1
you've seen the: 1
titanium bars not: 1
it pretty soon: 1
you why he: 1
had hard evidence: 1
evil which does: 1
he has taken: 1
someone who wasn't: 1
are not fooling: 1
zabini wouldn't just: 1
yesterday but back: 1
not at all: 1
wizards who mistake: 1
dumbledore looked quite: 1
corporeal patronus and: 1
a cat okay: 1
rose up and: 1
you're the one: 1
water droplets from: 1
shriek the veil: 1
and back of: 1
of the abyss: 1
cold came more: 1
if you can: 1
his eyes i: 1
not from death: 1
ills of this: 1
malfoy it didn't: 1
like he wanted: 1
mysterious circumstances and: 1
around the rings: 1
jiggling it to: 1
how could damage: 1
to speak -: 1
a bit of: 1
answer you don't: 1
it is evil: 1
it is he: 1
session in potions: 1
puzzle that makes: 1
i'm saying not: 1
yet being one: 1
loss harry said: 1
it might be: 1
could verify the: 1
even better celebrate: 1
shoes he should: 1
death was just: 1
great many things: 1
will you become: 1
headmaster and all: 1
truncheons once a: 1
harry yes and: 1
was trying not: 1
- i've heard: 1
ever going to: 1
behaviors with no: 1
nature headmaster no: 1
and ticking there: 1
and he was: 1
suppose it is: 1
peaceful i am: 1
by induction on: 1
plus an auror: 1
the living though: 1
a full corporeal: 1
himself it is: 1
wasn't smart to: 1
did i not: 1
the third auror: 1
be asking you: 1
dead wife and: 1
be satisfied until: 1
not define myself: 1
and final rules: 1
that it can: 1
can you just: 1
i was a: 1
i am merely: 1
at his own: 1
would never have: 1
that way the: 1
did more and: 1
is so harry: 1
a single tiny: 1
of a plate: 1
guidelines i did: 1
to cast their: 1
would never seek: 1
you've seen ghosts: 1
it and so: 1
refuse it when: 1
maybe in the: 1
now hard and: 1
ever that there: 1
eye out for: 1
and the explanation: 1
term for fairness: 1
at all times: 1
story harry's voice: 1
my parents were: 1
anger rising but: 1
to speak the: 1
said there is: 1
illness of the: 1
had lost someone: 1
little thing called: 1
lived a hundred: 1
about if instead: 1
grandchild's hundredth birthday: 1
said more softly: 1
until he ended: 1
i can tell: 1
profound instead of: 1
to feel a: 1
say that to: 1
was the phrase: 1
at the end: 1
for headmaster harry: 1
you stood by: 1
that why should: 1
a finite list: 1
guy and dumbledore's: 1
had been like: 1
a gateway to: 1
am afraid dumbledore: 1
tremendously powerful monster: 1
have long wondered: 1
is science as: 1
succeed right so: 1
given time dumbledore: 1
started talking and: 1
about the evidence: 1
them if they: 1
maybe he should: 1
headmaster was still: 1
i don't want: 1
growing sad do: 1
first name and: 1
possibly think any: 1
and harry had: 1
not horrible and: 1
a way to: 1
sprung to mind: 1
dark lord doesn't: 1
up with everyone: 1
in time it: 1
patronus and send: 1
gentle laughter in: 1
am permitted to: 1
that death was: 1
beard unnoticed had: 1
believe there is: 1
scientist does but: 1
thought harry but: 1
raised his hand: 1
had actually happened: 1
still exists as: 1
eventually cease to: 1
centuries harry the: 1
why why harry: 1
as more than: 1
i sacrificed everything: 1
had grown more: 1
there you would: 1
something about it: 1
dying at say: 1
all times -: 1
i have listened: 1
one knows but: 1
the symbol of: 1
wizard nodded i: 1
to happen except: 1
his own hands: 1
could damage to: 1
wizards no said: 1
encompass their wicked: 1
you can't even: 1
of dumbledore's tolerance: 1
hundred would seem: 1
dumbledore's condescension and: 1
for impressing ancient: 1
because if you: 1
originally told professor: 1
image from the: 1
hear out your: 1
rather embarrassed yes: 1
so that nothing: 1
yet the dementor: 1
power of the: 1
albus percival wulfric: 1
harry when my: 1
fact it was: 1
deathly hallows a: 1
closed his eyes: 1
him less reluctant: 1
in flames looked: 1
down the older: 1
be fighting a: 1
not mourn me: 1
happen except for: 1
what voldemort said: 1
pop splat chime: 1
his forehead and: 1
i supposed to: 1
black veil like: 1
by my friends: 1
lacking the old: 1
thinks death is: 1
to grasp at: 1
ball firmly back: 1
ought to be: 1
comprehend that if: 1
muggle things i: 1
that would defeat: 1
a hand across: 1
to you only: 1
walls of hiroshima: 1
scientist it is: 1
you asked them: 1
has to be: 1
it was myrtle: 1
but then he: 1
halfway through before: 1
defense and of: 1
others is to: 1
professor flitwick staring: 1
feeling as outraged: 1
or just projecting: 1
and worry voldemort: 1
six times before: 1
bzzzt ding glorp: 1
monster no said: 1
good it simply: 1
your dead wife: 1
shield the student: 1
voice was agonized: 1
would be most: 1
were hit on: 1
everything about how: 1
sober purple than: 1
for advice i'll: 1
can't even notice: 1
have realized that: 1
just that why: 1
his voice had: 1
it sacrificed part: 1
to call back: 1
i will do: 1
it i do: 1
he'd do just: 1
look for it: 1
approaching deadly crystalline: 1
me for advice: 1
at the universe: 1
intent if you: 1
a ritual terrible: 1
the deepest and: 1
just to see: 1
are walking i: 1
the moment you: 1
means ill thank: 1
them into plain: 1
lord and next: 1
you remark on: 1
the entire monastery: 1
wearily he'd hoped: 1
transfiguration class and: 1
and the hands: 1
would be fonder: 1
of evil why: 1
resurrection stone only: 1
last word perhaps: 1
it is one: 1
hermione granger will: 1
something evil and: 1
go to meet: 1
the whole thing: 1
us anything except: 1
sun's light but: 1
of the souls: 1
no now the: 1
of professor quirrell: 1
die x were: 1
dumbledore there was: 1
things you cannot: 1
the clock struck: 1
voice trailed off: 1
but it seems: 1
be truly with: 1
it probably was: 1
dry as he: 1
malfoy notes blurted: 1
would go to: 1
ambition and that: 1
lived in the: 1
a tattered black: 1
celebrity harry and: 1
you have the: 1
call death better: 1
be present while: 1
cliches good question: 1
for good reasons: 1
headmaster let me: 1
as his fingers: 1
helpless and he: 1
makes you fond: 1
them back that: 1
stayed with the: 1
and wise you: 1
quirrell means ill: 1
was a look: 1
that there wasn't: 1
like that you: 1
grown more remote: 1
mysterious dark side: 1
crystal ball firmly: 1
some from far: 1
going from not: 1
harry went on: 1
direction just to: 1
his eyes seemed: 1
rendezvous with everyone: 1
quibbler headlines you: 1
world works on: 1
was born on: 1
on the wrong: 1
accidentally impressed into: 1
was born of: 1
dumbledore said seriously: 1
you imagine destroying: 1
the chill that: 1
harry said trying: 1
come to harm: 1
lord had put: 1
just that harry: 1
a struggle within: 1
near the dementor: 1
eyes well sounding: 1
everyone i mean: 1
voice went hard: 1
weapons was harry: 1
portraits stored memories: 1
bit tempting about: 1
said that to: 1
harry by everyone: 1
barely barely kept: 1
time he'd managed: 1
it was hard: 1
him if he: 1
he opened his: 1
imagine your way: 1
believe that harry: 1
broken six times: 1
back the dark: 1
replied the headmaster: 1
reluctantly harry hadn't: 1
wiped at his: 1
said quietly harry: 1
he truly believed: 1
do dark wizards: 1
duplicating the power: 1
it will prove: 1
but this much: 1
animal and him: 1
harry you're a: 1
it his immortality: 1
plot will be: 1
his voice calmer: 1
6pm and wearily: 1
without moon or: 1
and gestures to: 1
think about it: 1
old wizard passed: 1
dementor through the: 1
so harry took: 1
patronus charm and: 1
wish to die: 1
a dementor were: 1
story that got: 1
mean harry said: 1
i have intercepted: 1
it took murder: 1
that will be: 1
you mean those: 1
auror would cast: 1
being hit on: 1
enough cunning to: 1
go on intercepting: 1
a bad guy: 1
that everyone had: 1
said seriously there: 1
great many owls: 1
at all europe: 1
he did not: 1
know though not: 1
there to make: 1
its stand for: 1
draco actually took: 1
you from this: 1
saturn learn the: 1
only for impressing: 1
thirty seconds because: 1
he killed himself: 1
worst horror for: 1
its anger though: 1
in the security: 1
everyone you're the: 1
ability to phrase: 1
now how to: 1
expression only that: 1
born of a: 1
taken it further: 1
world is truly: 1
dementor and dumbledore: 1
you plus an: 1
thoughtfully at the: 1
harry gazed equably: 1
was a lot: 1
harry poked and: 1
a long trip: 1
to live so: 1
yourself would murder: 1
i suspect that: 1
dead person would: 1
looked into it: 1
misdeeds could you: 1
sorry headmaster the: 1
one person who'd: 1
in the wizarding: 1
just took the: 1
linger here in: 1
anything exists in: 1
believe the resurrection: 1
i'd never get: 1
to popularize a: 1
an eye out: 1
have me hauled: 1
louder and more: 1
damaged state -: 1
mesh in faded: 1
would restore his: 1
archway made a: 1
brought in to: 1
was a startled: 1
and jiggling it: 1
inside you that: 1
the headmaster's point: 1
threat but in: 1
death as part: 1
evils and called: 1
that nothing remains: 1
alive now can: 1
for an afterlife: 1
me about the: 1
road though i: 1
in the midst: 1
their very souls: 1
a long moment: 1
notice especially not: 1
wizard's face relaxed: 1
it - no: 1
after all i: 1
may do to: 1
most sympathy from: 1
the bowl and: 1
said slowly i: 1
understand notice i: 1
of the headmaster's: 1
to the chair: 1
idiot who made: 1
realistic combat conditions: 1
now and lined: 1
looked quite serious: 1
my patronus and: 1
right now thank: 1
with themselves thought: 1
slytherin's key for: 1
sunk into it: 1
said the boy: 1
maybe it was: 1
made a little: 1
young boy with: 1
order of problem: 1
point one harry: 1
it this way: 1
and predict their: 1
on his dark: 1
good question harry: 1
realize often wizards: 1
excuse to be: 1
to be this: 1
ten points from: 1
mind a blazing: 1
was a small: 1
got one deathly: 1
sympathy from professor: 1
harry was trying: 1
just projecting an: 1
champion professor flitwick: 1
that people in: 1
thing called a: 1
was the first: 1
beloved from the: 1
explanation for something: 1
question whose answer: 1
the veil harry: 1
across the office: 1
he offered to: 1
i know why: 1
misunderstood by you: 1
to die it: 1
at him as: 1
had drifted into: 1
full of significant: 1
off and love: 1
first grandchild's tenth: 1
you could hear: 1
harry surely you: 1
marked do you: 1
mcgonagall that the: 1
little dry as: 1
one yourself it: 1
clue and somehow: 1
beep thud how: 1
though in helplessness: 1
face he committed: 1
ought to die: 1
got to back: 1
permanent or temporary: 1
gleaned his secret: 1
for hermione granger: 1
charm will succeed: 1
that they were: 1
his ambition all: 1
i try my: 1
why you'd have: 1
and so it: 1
upon his face: 1
say he picked: 1
a day some: 1
i was very: 1
the boy with: 1
only zabini's word: 1
in surprise how: 1
still strong placed: 1
were intent if: 1
in britain the: 1
lap maybe he: 1
his strange office: 1
time is when: 1
to keep his: 1
what's the veil: 1
sound a little: 1
far - many: 1
to whisper to: 1
turned himself invisible: 1
on the positive: 1
friends nor live: 1
lucius malfoy it: 1
harry i want: 1
so tell me: 1
that you really: 1
finally when the: 1
kind of silence: 1
really died i: 1
all the whirring: 1
say eighty harry's: 1
evil nor good: 1
very bad extremely: 1
than i ever: 1
own great foe: 1
entire session in: 1
conditions wanting to: 1
who didn't act: 1
evil happens thought: 1
you for coming: 1
was frowning sternly: 1
if hitler had: 1
castle by the: 1
you mean i: 1
religion toot beep: 1
into it with: 1
was never my: 1
ran on cliches: 1
dispel his patronus: 1
his lost beloved: 1
but to listen: 1
or perhaps harry: 1
and lined by: 1
putting them into: 1
to consult your: 1
were still alive: 1
straightened and his: 1
cat okay said: 1
the so-called laws: 1
yes ghosts do: 1
death really is: 1
could talk to: 1
to wear on: 1
better go off: 1
which you condemn: 1
a clearly visible: 1
neither evil nor: 1
someone's mind completely: 1
whispered dumbledore water: 1
point anywhere -: 1
already seen that: 1
he should just: 1
you went up: 1
mum and dad: 1
a clock as: 1
mean yesterday but: 1
they stood there: 1
old wizard rose: 1
patronus charm will: 1
you check off: 1
like the headmaster: 1
heard about their: 1
looked ancient now: 1
sternly the eyes: 1
wizard passed a: 1
almost begging evil: 1
see why zabini: 1
was trying to: 1
are afraid of: 1
of you harry: 1
to console themselves: 1
there has to: 1
harry still remembered: 1
tougher or it: 1
into it dumbledore: 1
allowing a dementor: 1
at him a: 1
fate to which: 1
said in perfect: 1
headmaster nodded so: 1
eyes the old: 1
he realized that: 1
do you know: 1
genius said dumbledore: 1
would change everything: 1
i suppose his: 1
family to a: 1
notes of yesterday's: 1
gazed equably back: 1
which he gleaned: 1
elsewhere dumbledore stared: 1
it with a: 1
think you're not: 1
would have noticed: 1
not imagine love: 1
than years i: 1
was still looking: 1
not exist x: 1
myrtle who died: 1
away on a: 1
well harry said: 1
flitwick would also: 1
relaxed out of: 1
like an answer: 1
we've explored the: 1
dumbledore more softly: 1
headmaster this time: 1
stretched things just: 1
this had been: 1
birthday party on: 1
should be no: 1
just go ahead: 1
was when harry: 1
harry ought to: 1
but i know: 1
long trip to: 1
sort of thing: 1
everyone had lost: 1
first time anyone: 1
finds that fear: 1
truly desire so: 1
getting hit and: 1
in an actual: 1
trudged off toward: 1
to appear very: 1
final rules of: 1
had said that: 1
listen then harry: 1
off harry felt: 1
what will become: 1
evil thoughts but: 1
cease to exist: 1
and that huge: 1
stretched between the: 1
blazing fury of: 1
up to someone: 1
up to console: 1
the department of: 1
exist why you'd: 1
a truncheon once: 1
live they fear: 1
wizard i mean: 1
yes well harry: 1
not a finite: 1
the sad thing: 1
you that to: 1
which to define: 1
something more to: 1
simply does not: 1
cycle until he: 1
argument funny thing: 1
you go on: 1
here am i: 1
one else would: 1
was plain now: 1
answer that sounded: 1
archway old and: 1
elementary logical tautologies: 1
than life then: 1
hold on said: 1
with a sad: 1
a bit disappointed: 1
cadmus peverell used: 1
finding a way: 1
quietly taking his: 1
write something even: 1
touched the veil: 1
dumbledore death is: 1
sheepishly recited as: 1
that seemed to: 1
let your brain's: 1
stone calls back: 1
the eyes of: 1
thought harry it: 1
that everyone the: 1
days when you're: 1
headmaster blackmailing zabini: 1
into plain english: 1
in that subjunctive: 1
and i'm always: 1
wise you can't: 1
when you try: 1
old wizard began: 1
the good books: 1
say that you: 1
it away do: 1
you're not getting: 1
other i'm not: 1
of his mum: 1
thud crackle whoosh: 1
and one-way passage: 1
there was exactly: 1
of saturn learn: 1
know how the: 1
said peacefully i: 1
dumbledore wanted and: 1
funerals because they: 1
said harry with: 1
survived and what: 1
boy an iron: 1
as important as: 1
again that doesn't: 1
his lieutenants and: 1
potions in his: 1
wizard - i've: 1
himself to be: 1
grow to be: 1
three aurors at: 1
would be the: 1
of detailed analysis: 1
why zabini wouldn't: 1
escape this universe: 1
dried blood the: 1
not getting hit: 1
plot and that: 1
have you no: 1
do it he: 1
and no one: 1
harry could feel: 1
harry but he: 1
ever forgive you: 1
trying to keep: 1
the stars don't: 1
young harry to: 1
tattered black veil: 1
dementor is to: 1
when i went: 1
known without even: 1
are just optional: 1
feel a bit: 1
in a cage: 1
people were accustomed: 1
done and yet: 1
harry am i: 1
now he hadn't: 1
never have imagined: 1
distraction from if: 1
do evil for: 1
through that entire: 1
of its anger: 1
hand in flames: 1
his fingers stirred: 1
musical chimes as: 1
auror - the: 1
it was too: 1
just gone away: 1
his slogan and: 1
better not actually: 1
something better dumbledore: 1
wanted to learn: 1
asylum so why: 1
be heard from: 1
road you are: 1
stuff up to: 1
had better not: 1
before breakfast each: 1
they don't have: 1
there'd be all: 1
somehow managing to: 1
dumbledore smiling slightly: 1
with lord malfoy: 1
his eyes and: 1
a little wizened: 1
lord malfoy henceforth: 1
then that's bound: 1
by two of: 1
of the grounds: 1
door the room: 1
nodded i am: 1
anything except to: 1
be immortal harry: 1
yes and so: 1
thought the universe: 1
had lied but: 1
how did you: 1
voldemort whirr bzzzt: 1
two the hypothesis: 1
nailing the skins: 1
something i'm not: 1
young man great: 1
you touched the: 1
seemed far too: 1
into it harry: 1
harry sheepishly recited: 1
harry looked down: 1
it didn't seem: 1
die before my: 1
we care there: 1
bowl and jiggling: 1
there was pouring: 1
less afraid than: 1
be suspicious the: 1
it is something: 1
defeat the entire: 1
to go down: 1
you away you: 1
it might not: 1
said dumbledore tell: 1
have religion toot: 1
did not say: 1
grindelwald's worst horror: 1
there wasn't anything: 1
you must think: 1
to become evil: 1
see if the: 1
all the interesting: 1
corporeal patronus charm: 1
office and dumbledore: 1
through the gates: 1
and studied with: 1
has asked me: 1
being alive for: 1
joy that has: 1
not doing those: 1
do not think: 1
go down to: 1
they actually knew: 1
the three legendary: 1
distraction harry said: 1
said dumbledore my: 1
live on after: 1
of sailing ships: 1
the sound of: 1
much does he: 1
with you the: 1
ability to talk: 1
could so easily: 1
wall have you: 1
avoid all interaction: 1
man is more: 1
scared of a: 1
imagine destroying a: 1
never seen or: 1
add safety margin: 1
disappointed by dumbledore's: 1
you lied or: 1
and cozen up: 1
but still greatly: 1
stone to call: 1
is to ask: 1
the truth and: 1
to blow someone's: 1
protect his classmates: 1
were allowed onto: 1
explored the whole: 1
was what the: 1
the dementor each: 1
like the surface: 1
is the way: 1
even heard of: 1
asking for very: 1
some sort of: 1
class that monday: 1
somehow that didn't: 1
professor quirrell would: 1
you take me: 1
i'm not doing: 1
dark mirror the: 1
a dangerous road: 1
bad extremely bad: 1
least not without: 1
two corporeal patronuses: 1
notice i have: 1
fury coming fully: 1
very creative -: 1
twisted and warped: 1
reached up and: 1
more remote as: 1
had been allowed: 1
occasionally blinked and: 1
rhythm of the: 1
be a whole: 1
yourself it was: 1
tiniest bit tempting: 1
harry and growing: 1
that can be: 1
be fonder of: 1
first great-great-great grandchild's: 1
professor quirrell how: 1

the headmaster sighed: 1
for the fear: 1
if you stayed: 1

the headmaster's desk: 1
like they'd just: 1
and called it: 1

for a stone: 1
that monday and: 1
would have been: 1
mind searched hastily: 1
know it doesn't: 1
keep his voice: 1
not read them: 1
then he volunteered: 1
understand now he: 1
anyone possibly think: 1
knew their loved: 1
and instead in: 1
of horror i: 1
day students awaiting: 1
eyes were fixed: 1
flattered no not: 1
of an actual: 1
he couldn't see: 1
his robes and: 1
was crying because: 1
quietly will be: 1
flee the coming: 1
harry he said: 1

back into its: 1
tried to hear: 1
it wasn't smart: 1
to add safety: 1
lord was still: 1
sure i do: 1
is unable to: 1
a line dividing: 1
draw forth the: 1
patronus did fail: 1
no harry the: 1
a great big: 1
everyone tick crackle: 1
came more slowly: 1
everyone the human: 1
you try to: 1
crying because i: 1
transfiguration said harry: 1
are things that: 1
x were beyond: 1
of making stuff: 1
become a monster: 1
were fixed on: 1
trio all three: 1
manifestation of the: 1
patronus why this: 1
that has not: 1
goldfish bowl and: 1
it just took: 1
this impressed me: 1
quirrell would be: 1
that i could: 1
up on the: 1
from not a: 1
annoyance the cold: 1
she left her: 1
ask him i: 1
new insights you: 1
argument now how: 1
but then lucius: 1
them both thank: 1
all seriousness i'm: 1
the most terrible: 1
fooling me harry: 1
to me in: 1
do one or: 1
dementor onto the: 1
of the milky: 1
sounding wise wasn't: 1
slogan and he: 1
what a scientist: 1
not this impressed: 1
my friends the: 1
be thought harry: 1
the headmaster prevent: 1
he know the: 1
cunning than lucius: 1
gazed at harry: 1
ahead of his: 1
i'm a scientist: 1
one deathly hallow: 1
to a newsroom: 1
it in advance: 1
rising this is: 1
consult your unique: 1
say it because: 1
hero had cunning: 1
really believe the: 1
instead of letting: 1
really don't see: 1
daze trudged over: 1
little sad but: 1
do you said: 1
passed a hand: 1
don't care or: 1
not eager to: 1
dumbledore appeared to: 1
it i suspect: 1
was also clear: 1
trying not to: 1
still greatly worried: 1
was smiling now: 1
time dumbledore stared: 1
sounded profound instead: 1
office cold and: 1
i know and: 1
your evidence because: 1
you fond of: 1
student could suffer: 1
plain english like: 1
a crystal ball: 1
the course of: 1
blood chilled into: 1
of all creatures: 1
his immortality was: 1
every student who: 1
now more reluctantly: 1
of grace the: 1
more slowly now: 1
for example call: 1
at harry harry: 1
hauled right off: 1
of dark wizards: 1
is a dangerous: 1
like being scared: 1
even in the: 1
harry said everything: 1
ticking there was: 1
the entire point: 1
some reason harry: 1
suggest you take: 1
there be thought: 1
enough to make: 1
prodded but he: 1
that direction just: 1
was myrtle poor: 1
wait by the: 1
discover aliens create: 1
once because that's: 1
harry said quietly: 1
are twisted and: 1
room full of: 1
to the grounds: 1
people would act: 1
soul by which: 1
loved ones were: 1
and darkish and: 1
but not horrible: 1
not think i: 1
my dark mirror: 1
his ambition and: 1
amazing wonderful great: 1
know why you: 1
and he had: 1
hundred and fifty: 1
then harry please: 1
dark wizard to: 1
dashed someone built: 1
of his servants': 1
behind him with: 1
his face he: 1
nodded so you: 1
to have your: 1
it doesn't mean: 1
headmaster from memory: 1
act like that: 1
voldemort have survived: 1
smiling now and: 1
wizards very well: 1
you care for: 1
ghosts harry said: 1
seem just as: 1
you're suspicious -: 1
twist that same: 1
voldemort himself it: 1
invisibility from his: 1
insights you just: 1
been committed in: 1
managed to think: 1
tolerance for blindingly: 1
in time a: 1
stone has been: 1
didn't do something: 1
does but first: 1
a soul the: 1
stool and harry: 1
would do anything: 1
condemn my house: 1
whether someone could: 1
absent and he: 1
have any guesses: 1
professor quirrell's teaching: 1
the unintended force: 1
of view right: 1
love without ceasing: 1
would mind but: 1
limits of dumbledore's: 1
into infinitely darker: 1
universe which you: 1
me but i: 1
possibly-crazy headmaster everything: 1
different order of: 1
if they wanted: 1
soul and that: 1
his body if: 1
harry was to: 1
each morning harry: 1
ask i shouldn't: 1
an illness of: 1
cold still lingering: 1
firmly back into: 1
dementor's presence would: 1
to prevent from: 1
committed acts worse: 1
the next day: 1
when it is: 1
is a good: 1
past self faced: 1
to agree disagreements: 1
blood the symbol: 1
helped me much: 1
a psychological problem: 1
you so listen: 1
any sort of: 1
the headmaster's voice: 1
how much does: 1
happen in the: 1
old wizard shook: 1
why not they: 1
was said in: 1
without yet being: 1
headmaster wouldn't be: 1
harry realized that: 1
quirrell how about: 1
to st mungo's: 1
this is a: 1
harry it's entirely: 1
with everyone else: 1
watch it at: 1
not interesting what's: 1
straight his chin: 1
span if harry: 1
his voice flat: 1
a truncheon but: 1
science to which: 1
they had only: 1
flat you mean: 1
sake you must: 1
soon there'd be: 1
this time not: 1
harry felt rather: 1
strange thing by: 1
people who'd passed: 1
be because i've: 1
dueling champion professor: 1
than you may: 1
harm then and: 1
small musical chimes: 1
you the headmaster: 1
notice anything i'm: 1
to teach the: 1
anything to prevent: 1
cannot give i: 1
that had come: 1
dead calling always: 1
impression wizards didn't: 1
previously headmaster harry: 1
read them of: 1
time not a: 1
why for a: 1
chill that went: 1
happier on the: 1
have known i: 1
then after him: 1
it might take: 1
to phrase things: 1
thing by which: 1
the hogwarts wards: 1
they learned the: 1
accomplish if a: 1
the silvery mesh: 1
to call them: 1
dumbledore's face had: 1
beliefs seriously and: 1
to do something: 1
the dementor behind: 1
you for things: 1
their own making: 1
it's entirely consistent: 1
more softly as: 1
next day the: 1
you a look: 1
he was ahead: 1
myself yet been: 1
evidence dumbledore appeared: 1
resurrection stone was: 1
in all seriousness: 1
voice exposed upon: 1
just afterimages burned: 1
the milky way: 1
spat harry the: 1
got to do: 1
nothingness then he: 1
much i know: 1
is not the: 1
he was dressed: 1
quietly oh said: 1
to exist why: 1
i have heard: 1
for backchat the: 1
gone forever and: 1
thought of his: 1
said trying to: 1
wizard shook his: 1
and without accusation: 1
your mind i: 1
and that made: 1
crime that had: 1
chair in front: 1
vast gap of: 1
unlikely event that: 1
and i suspect: 1
any before him: 1
- i think: 1
there was nothing: 1
and frank longbottom: 1
if your soul: 1
the puzzle that: 1
frowned thoughtfully at: 1
and dropped back: 1
harry was frowning: 1
hairs i think: 1
the lightning-bolt scar: 1
on a greenish: 1
be an act: 1
old wizard with: 1
seen or done: 1
headmaster's eyes were: 1
in dumbledore's voice: 1
what's the resurrection: 1
good books and: 1
now he said: 1
interaction with lord: 1
just to be: 1
of hogwarts hold: 1
actual dementor going: 1
slowly now more: 1
days of sailing: 1
acts worse by: 1
headmaster sighed and: 1
idea to tell: 1
into the surrounding: 1
professor quirrell usually: 1
shall be sure: 1
offered to pay: 1
but let's not: 1
force of the: 1
in plainer english: 1
could just bring: 1
suddenly far from: 1
souls there wouldn't: 1
salient threat but: 1
would stay well: 1
was the crazy: 1
took a step: 1
i used to: 1
when i saw: 1
flaw in the: 1
patronus charm to: 1
after you tricked: 1
fraud harry said: 1
harry stood up: 1
the students was: 1
a mysterious conversation: 1
which occasionally blinked: 1
you must stay: 1
as brain damage: 1
me tell you: 1
that it will: 1
reluctantly nodded for: 1
they had hard: 1
could suffer any: 1
does not care: 1
to a full: 1
by everyone i: 1
fzzzt albus percival: 1
encounter with lucius: 1
headmaster and i: 1
be this impossible: 1
- harry asked: 1
lord survived and: 1
must believe a: 1
to people and: 1
i would ask: 1
even sound like: 1
ghosts - the: 1
through him at: 1
of letting them: 1
i receive them: 1
years i know: 1
back that harry: 1
thought there was: 1
side lately harry: 1
so it might: 1
wouldn't matter that: 1
an evil deed: 1
and i used: 1
them linger here: 1
for a long: 1
by which people: 1
conclusions i i: 1
headmaster was frowning: 1
and you could: 1
dementor is completely: 1
muggles too not: 1
in every generation: 1
bubble - what: 1
have to say: 1
it that they: 1
could ask him: 1
will be five: 1
all i thought: 1
eyes he took: 1
don't get into: 1
so you won't: 1
each other across: 1
taught the martial: 1
your whole brain: 1
would also be: 1
of things that: 1
in the same: 1
a terrible thing: 1
is sorely lacking: 1
and muttered this: 1
said quietly will: 1
country did i: 1
the gryffindor as: 1
only imagine them: 1
just fumbled through: 1
it because you: 1
down upon others: 1
dumbledore but i: 1
barely on the: 1
care there is: 1
tell the story: 1
and next time: 1
be happening elsewhere: 1
phrase things so: 1
face relaxed out: 1
to not be: 1
solemn now but: 1
glass things of: 1
with hermione and: 1
demanded that his: 1
believed in an: 1
good reasons they: 1
a blazing fury: 1
my best to: 1
you listened too: 1
again and i: 1
reasons they just: 1
paced to a: 1
look down upon: 1
many of which: 1
veil said the: 1
i shall be: 1
to live that: 1
why he became: 1
was when i: 1
way of professor: 1
know what you: 1
convinced if you: 1
ever been committed: 1
sounded impressively cunning: 1
quietly harry shrugged: 1
side and think: 1
wizard his voice: 1
disapproval you don't: 1
act like the: 1
you believe tell: 1
the silhouettes left: 1
look of ancientness: 1
calmer now that: 1
until harry went: 1
drummed on a: 1
that i've discovered: 1
was very much: 1
it is to: 1
right spell to: 1
me greatly but: 1
to protect his: 1
or the sun: 1
for equally huge: 1
but you have: 1
his patronus before: 1
part of his: 1
just in case: 1
interesting what's the: 1
dumbledore point two: 1
though not why: 1
don't know but: 1
that requires killing: 1
headmaster at his: 1
he had paced: 1
was ahead but: 1
slight twist that: 1
thought i was: 1
boy bowed to: 1
face what do: 1
arms and that: 1
could voldemort have: 1
thought the world: 1
had ever really: 1
perhaps harry said: 1
was nothing there: 1
look rather worried: 1
and they are: 1
i think it: 1
evidence because that's: 1
don't you dare: 1
and kill neville's: 1
i'll just give: 1
that entire session: 1
never seek to: 1
death they do: 1
it was the: 1
answer would be: 1
wise so young: 1
script and the: 1
a soul ripping: 1
and so i: 1
was still near: 1
his hand trailed: 1
mighty cage i: 1
time a dementor's: 1
by the burst: 1
surprise how would: 1
memory then harry: 1
all the laughter: 1
does he know: 1
way to escape: 1
wizard the young: 1
because to believe: 1
harry it doesn't: 1
a ghost i: 1
his servants' left: 1
of motion the: 1
but true-forged in: 1
to ask a: 1
politeness harry raised: 1
as he thought: 1
to ask i: 1
bowl and was: 1
you take the: 1
walking i am: 1
do any tests: 1
watch invisibly time-turned: 1
and more rituals: 1
anything about it: 1
make him angry: 1
untrustworthy in fact: 1
the rings of: 1
side of the: 1
harry said if: 1
the same dementor: 1
harry said in: 1
puzzled though there: 1
things like portraits: 1
a circle drawn: 1
predict their evil: 1
at all harry: 1
and zabini was: 1
you're allowed to: 1
be definitely verified: 1
whole different order: 1
it first but: 1
whole thing meet: 1
wounded animal and: 1
might not have: 1
still in his: 1
allowed into architecture: 1
of death and: 1
evil is to: 1
his wisdom love: 1
no reason and: 1
for those amazing: 1
everyone else who: 1
huh harry said: 1
wizard shaking his: 1
zabini for which: 1
cast a patronus: 1
will to live: 1
his patronus and: 1
do something to: 1
like that the: 1
wearily i know: 1
him and it: 1
made him less: 1
and at himself: 1
suspect that you: 1
death that finds: 1
the headmaster looking: 1
because if so: 1
test to see: 1
later all right: 1
himself even as: 1
realized that would: 1
refuse to hear: 1
loved the most: 1
as love as: 1
off toward the: 1
in to the: 1
human species had: 1
my first great-great-great: 1
was finding it: 1
imagine them so: 1
life then you: 1
recollections honestly dumbledore's: 1
poked and prodded: 1
that and at: 1
you think you're: 1
unable to comprehend: 1
end there was: 1
was still staring: 1
always calling in: 1
and you think: 1
in the right: 1
else if they: 1
psychological problem the: 1
everyone for a: 1
trudged over to: 1
drumming soundlessly through: 1
wise than harry: 1
then lucius was: 1
won't have to: 1
third auror would: 1
couldn't even feel: 1
said firmly it's: 1
souls do you: 1
the physical manifestation: 1
so-called laws of: 1
where they lay: 1
making stuff up: 1
to be helping: 1
who made stupidly: 1
as outraged as: 1
you asked why: 1
love and cannot: 1
wasn't asking for: 1
about how my: 1
such thing as: 1
the way of: 1
problem the headmaster: 1
turned them back: 1
to live just: 1
the end straightforward: 1
pace through the: 1
but he couldn't: 1
i can understand: 1
to the temptation: 1
from death life: 1
be why not: 1
hallows kin to: 1
really calling back: 1
of water stretched: 1
actually since you: 1
don't like science: 1
not comprehend that: 1
of water that: 1
feedback cycle until: 1
not fooling me: 1
then look within: 1
wish that i: 1
premature as dying: 1
three personally known: 1
an amazing wonderful: 1
mouth open he: 1
except to not: 1
it that it: 1
dumbledore would restore: 1
of the veil: 1
which does not: 1
dinner and spoken: 1
or something yes: 1
words and gestures: 1
speak - so: 1
all the good: 1
had ever lost: 1
my owls but: 1
evil the dark: 1
to pass the: 1
that flees not: 1
try to kindle: 1
instructors be brought: 1
didn't say it: 1
as though in: 1
see it and: 1
the laws of: 1
ill could be: 1
throne began to: 1
is light in: 1
at harry a: 1
much of that: 1
in his mind: 1
what evil could: 1
good with only: 1
in perfect seriousness: 1
seems a strange: 1
for i receive: 1
always from the: 1
that to comprehend: 1
said dumbledore more: 1
legendary deathly hallows: 1
margin why just: 1
out of its: 1
forget that i'm: 1
the most have: 1
why harry stared: 1
head his voice: 1
said harry don't: 1
the only dark: 1
ever even heard: 1
young boy stood: 1
foe that makes: 1
it to shield: 1
know i thought: 1
because i was: 1
figure of the: 1
eyes seemed to: 1
could give no: 1
hufflepuff's bones into: 1
you're a wizard: 1
this time dumbledore: 1
ancient waiting eyes: 1
on that it: 1
as they were: 1
which is the: 1
off why had: 1
to perform other: 1
look in those: 1
his voice since: 1
took the right: 1
then you must: 1
accompanied by a: 1
both know how: 1
in fact indicate: 1
used in place: 1
was but still: 1
souls back from: 1
like the silhouettes: 1
soul ripping it: 1
rippling surface between: 1
his cheeks while: 1
that said dumbledore: 1
- i cannot: 1
less reluctant to: 1
wizard was staring: 1
i fear is: 1
world for example: 1
ambition all for: 1
not afraid of: 1
them my mother: 1
whirr professor flitwick: 1
that the resurrection: 1
that huge tragedies: 1
years yes ghosts: 1
the violent death: 1
back his lost: 1
would use no: 1
shreds so that: 1
vanished anything it: 1
as part of: 1
that it wasn't: 1
it faintly drawn: 1
meet all the: 1
call them my: 1
through from that: 1
whoosh hiss chime: 1
own hands where: 1
black rippling surface: 1
better celebrate my: 1
of the hood: 1
now thank you: 1
bzzzt tick ding: 1
why anything exists: 1
would cast another: 1
smile absent and: 1
beard out of: 1
was so shocked: 1
mind your dead: 1
acts harry trailed: 1
but yours so: 1
like portraits stored: 1
i do think: 1
his mouth to: 1
said slowly save: 1
of thirty seconds: 1
up with an: 1
i can outwit: 1
hadn't been calling: 1
sternness in the: 1
things just a: 1
so as to: 1
and how it: 1
a dementor onto: 1
was that harry: 1
best of care: 1
something to numb: 1
not evil i'm: 1
as they touched: 1
of indignation seems: 1
dumbledore stared off: 1
quirrell than of: 1
of demanding that: 1
believe in an: 1
had ever been: 1
succeed in the: 1
you're so old: 1
what death really: 1
not always to: 1
of that said: 1
bit more deeply: 1
dumbledore water glittered: 1
dumbledore's patronus did: 1
not withstand the: 1
so much inside: 1
nor seek to: 1
spot where his: 1
than just that: 1
him with heavy: 1
- whether someone: 1
in his lap: 1
wizard was smiling: 1
ritual requiring human: 1
anything or teach: 1
or teach us: 1
his last shriek: 1
more solemn now: 1
iron certainty in: 1
i asked hermione: 1
from death but: 1
me headmaster tell: 1
himself for being: 1
who say that: 1
to the patronus: 1
you accomplish if: 1
life they desire: 1
more hopeful now: 1
stood by the: 1
will succeed in: 1
give you a: 1
for coming harry: 1
not turn them: 1
into a cat: 1
i find out: 1
master of the: 1
uh huh harry: 1
a question whose: 1
to australia back: 1
those you loved: 1
with calm dignity: 1
do know that: 1
go off and: 1
awarded himself a: 1
mistakes that snowballed: 1
away your ability: 1
an afterlife instead: 1
afraid dumbledore said: 1
hundred years that: 1
said starting to: 1
rose no no: 1
in case it: 1
of tiny tinkling: 1
to you harry: 1
is a distraction: 1
so i am: 1
he said it: 1
dumbledore my own: 1
the turning spiral: 1
now can you: 1
am i the: 1
it is woven: 1
you harry he: 1
this should be: 1
old wizard's eyes: 1
having hopes dashed: 1
you would go: 1
verified in this: 1
dark lord because: 1
you run and: 1
proceed maybe he: 1
is you probably: 1
is neither evil: 1
i suppose it: 1
folded parchment during: 1
for being so: 1
discovered the so-called: 1
and in time: 1
was my dark: 1
obvious the dementor: 1
it drove him: 1
very wise harry: 1
face was horrified: 1
he tore at: 1
and departed and: 1
the coldness clear: 1
the way people: 1
of minerva mcgonagall: 1
but from the: 1
so harry had: 1
slytherins the boy: 1
afraid of it: 1
is one last: 1
lost was really: 1
species had ever: 1
month like it: 1
truth but if: 1
and his eyes: 1
the train from: 1
harry surprised and: 1
my destined foe: 1
fail for some: 1
must think so: 1
on it i: 1
receive them too: 1
of a soul: 1
all interaction with: 1
a greenish tinge: 1
remark on it: 1
so there is: 1
the customary smile: 1
for something that: 1
wulfric brian dumbledore: 1
did fail for: 1
forever and ever: 1
dementor going from: 1
was wildly untrustworthy: 1
defense professor has: 1
was to visit: 1
sorry i've got: 1
can you not: 1
that sounded impressively: 1
harry said see: 1
- then harry: 1
the stone to: 1
let me tell: 1
with the headmaster's: 1
if not ghosts: 1
comes i will: 1
him hope or: 1
and you would: 1
probably was a: 1
said reluctantly the: 1
it ran out: 1
not perfect harry: 1
good thing yes: 1
once we've explored: 1
his students test: 1
headmaster tell me: 1
and expected a: 1
stood in professor: 1
yermy wibble's family: 1
die you've got: 1
were students near: 1
don't tell me: 1
the hardest time: 1
stretched his arms: 1
in place of: 1
that they sounded: 1
care who he: 1
not what to: 1
of muggle things: 1
the room and: 1
gentle superiority you're: 1
still looking at: 1
you become a: 1
was slowly taking: 1
headmaster with an: 1
my time comes: 1
country like they'd: 1
but in all: 1
somehow harry managed: 1
room and the: 1
great adventure oh: 1
worry voldemort stole: 1
believe that young: 1
shut up while: 1
make himself a: 1
voice almost begging: 1
he picked up: 1
- the old: 1
comprehend evil is: 1
for which they: 1
i have not: 1
to watch it: 1
and ever that: 1
look in character: 1
then he straightened: 1
is time the: 1
oh said harry: 1
can't believe that: 1
said if professor: 1
the dementor said: 1
to harm then: 1
course the headmaster: 1
your original question: 1
so wise so: 1
instead of throwing: 1
do not reach: 1
back - then: 1
is woven of: 1
but not in: 1
finally go out: 1
gone how could: 1
by far than: 1
at two hundred: 1
it wasn't that: 1
stars discover aliens: 1
was going to: 1
think i may: 1
they failed dumbledore: 1
were cadmus peverell: 1
i suggested to: 1
the blow -: 1
still alive now: 1
dark rituals maybe: 1
and stared at: 1
help me defeat: 1
it'll be because: 1
me harry what: 1
harry ever going: 1
dumb i jumped: 1
his own headmaster: 1
quietly professor quirrell: 1
horror i sacrificed: 1
eyes and remembered: 1
used the stone: 1
first do you: 1
as tragically premature: 1
his destined foe: 1
instead in his: 1
presence would corrode: 1
perfect seriousness and: 1
find even the: 1
of his good: 1
a dementor's presence: 1
wise for you: 1
gryffindor as it: 1
hundred times stronger: 1
more and more: 1
but flee the: 1
believe a test: 1
what said harry: 1
so that they: 1
harry said more: 1
would go over: 1
very strongly in: 1
who i wish: 1
harry paused because: 1
monday since he'd: 1
to being hit: 1
the land of: 1
anything surprising or: 1
voices of the: 1
fine after all: 1
fingers stirred it: 1
the edge of: 1
well obviously i'm: 1
dark blacker than: 1
in and how: 1
dreadful fate to: 1
voice rising this: 1
he took a: 1
corporeal patronus why: 1
you're afraid of: 1
damage if your: 1
best he could: 1
not even trying: 1
i defeated in: 1
eyebrows rose for: 1
horrible and i'd: 1
just very creative: 1
hundredth birthday party: 1
it perhaps it: 1
- headmaster harry: 1
lord which wasn't: 1
sacrificed everything only: 1
be guarded warded: 1
wise as you: 1
calls back the: 1
even still exists: 1
the inky black: 1
bit of it: 1
do the old: 1
only he loaded: 1
house slytherin blackmailing: 1
a scientist and: 1
i don't mean: 1
a small voice: 1
to become one: 1
greater good that: 1
one step ahead: 1
will succeed right: 1
all of thirty: 1
harry and in: 1
on speaking after: 1
and tried to: 1
old wizard and: 1
sorts of amazing: 1
do anything to: 1
i got here: 1
the interesting people: 1
integers if you: 1
fingers drummed on: 1
equably back at: 1
his own anger: 1
and if i: 1
restore his patronus: 1
will it be: 1
the world works: 1
state - harry: 1
tragically premature as: 1
resurrection stone calls: 1
a positive feedback: 1
to watch the: 1
thought so silly: 1
avoidable mistakes that: 1
this world if: 1
sure to keep: 1
have accepted my: 1
see it the: 1
very souls do: 1
i've heard that: 1
world ran on: 1
pass the dementor: 1
stupid i asked: 1
amazing benefits they'd: 1
quirrell had asked: 1
it through one: 1
as his past: 1
yourself that flees: 1
have helped me: 1
wants people to: 1
dead - bring: 1
out for a: 1
hesitation gives you: 1
you i am: 1
to say anything: 1
corrode that metal: 1
to 6pm and: 1
and you are: 1
henceforth did you: 1
a step closer: 1
surprise and mild: 1
your brain's pattern-matching: 1
make it an: 1
light to a: 1
yet i do: 1
take to kill: 1
or an idiot: 1
went all cold: 1
the positive integers: 1
tiniest clue and: 1
but dumbledore seemed: 1
debate about how: 1
wife and ask: 1
had intended you: 1
the same the: 1
hands the truth: 1
annihilation of a: 1
coming fully into: 1
realized that it: 1
there when i: 1
sort of answer: 1
came from somewhere: 1
adventure can you: 1
harry the headmaster's: 1
sailing ships which: 1
for whose sake: 1
remarkably artistic ink: 1
different positions in: 1
superiority you're so: 1
his recollections honestly: 1
way harry how: 1
difficult it was: 1
to share said: 1
sake of his: 1
so desperately or: 1
voice for now: 1
gap of incommensurability: 1
with everyone for: 1
to proceed maybe: 1
living though not: 1
much harry said: 1
universe was a: 1
voice calmer now: 1
i could so: 1
at its core: 1
to something i'm: 1
he'd just turned: 1
not have to: 1
his voice calm: 1
is never a: 1
cold and controlled: 1
tore at all: 1
truly asking that: 1
consistent with the: 1
on me but: 1
slowly save that: 1
share said dumbledore: 1
them and in: 1
calling back the: 1
lot more experience: 1
then headmaster i'd: 1
at the edge: 1
wizards seemingly unable: 1
be you plus: 1
positive feedback cycle: 1
anger though the: 1
safety margin why: 1
grapes if people: 1
europe like a: 1
it at all: 1
to die if: 1
desperately or if: 1
slow nod yes: 1
it was just: 1
go on to: 1
the ills of: 1
defined by my: 1
arms well i'd: 1
nod and the: 1
and i should: 1
a hug -: 1
little wearily he'd: 1
you really believe: 1
just don't want: 1
the friend that: 1
living it if: 1
right said the: 1
dementor and it: 1
exchange for those: 1
belong souls are: 1
harry was rather: 1
voice was trembling: 1
two cultures stared: 1
lot easier than: 1
whose sake you: 1
seen harry in: 1
charms class that: 1
myself clear dark: 1
those ancient eyes: 1
who thinks death: 1
voldemort is not: 1
than you a: 1
impressed into the: 1
had asked or: 1
for the gargoyle: 1
fighting a struggle: 1
and comfortable chair: 1
throwing them out: 1
and if dumbledore's: 1
myrtle poor sweet: 1
anyone to be: 1
an explanation for: 1
on living it: 1
a little i: 1
could do that: 1
stone only he: 1
in it it: 1
clear dark wizards: 1
splat chime toot: 1
think that i: 1
in advance with: 1
charm professor quirrell: 1
that outside instructors: 1
you could give: 1
very solemn despite: 1
very well indeed: 1
the wooden door: 1
allowed onto the: 1
ten years the: 1
his blood chilled: 1
maybe he found: 1
planning to do: 1
you would use: 1
about him a: 1
clock as they: 1
and spoken with: 1
time dumbledore looked: 1
the boy an: 1
using whatever deep: 1
said harry let: 1
kin to harry's: 1
auror trio all: 1
again the next: 1
ink drawing of: 1
of yourself would: 1
his hand to: 1
seriousness i'm not: 1
when the clock: 1
foes to encompass: 1
quirrell point one: 1
not made myself: 1
coming harry said: 1
more deeply wise: 1
violent death of: 1
death but from: 1
of europe would: 1
all evils and: 1
with a circle: 1
struck nine turned: 1
wasn't expecting ghosts: 1
hermione and eaten: 1
enemies harry stared: 1
as dying at: 1
of them that: 1
himself if i: 1
hear too many: 1
has been lost: 1
approach the dementor: 1
requires killing people: 1
tell me everything: 1
down said the: 1
the three aurors: 1
things i suppose: 1
up while he: 1
a large and: 1
school who thought: 1
but they are: 1
wizard will you: 1
i'm just very: 1
about how to: 1
silently passed harry: 1
stay well back: 1
which you would: 1
be five points: 1
friends the pain: 1
did he do: 1
wizards fear death: 1
deepest and final: 1
those ancient waiting: 1
malfoy was going: 1
or in plainer: 1
said that harry: 1
have long missed: 1
every generation the: 1
for that young: 1
was one of: 1
you wrote it: 1
use no ritual: 1
in potions in: 1
have known better: 1
he ended up: 1
that his students: 1
desperation in those: 1
is no life: 1
if people were: 1
harry managed to: 1
what you take: 1
who wished to: 1
passed harry a: 1
strange wonder and: 1
have noticed something: 1
the stone of: 1
end straightforward and: 1
just shut up: 1
asked them if: 1
creatures through the: 1
for you harry: 1
still a hint: 1
chilled into something: 1
if you have: 1
impressively cunning which: 1
pretend that anyone: 1
getting hit with: 1
dumbledore would dispel: 1
answered my question: 1
his pouch at: 1
deep as harry: 1
bwa ha ha: 1
there were students: 1
dumbledore's tolerance for: 1
serious the customary: 1
dark wizards fear: 1
repeated exposure to: 1
hurt was plain: 1
were only allowed: 1
pass was temporary: 1
live that down: 1
not regret being: 1
said dumbledore as: 1
gargoyle the turning: 1
actually makes a: 1
not a single: 1
it is an: 1
not before i: 1
breakfast each morning: 1
immediately afterward before: 1
gazing into each: 1
that i'd begun: 1
a bit more: 1
us make it: 1
suspect headmaster that: 1
the gates of: 1
heart stayed with: 1
i won't ever: 1
who would pass: 1
then gave a: 1
myself to watch: 1
and if they: 1
could and got: 1
to point anywhere: 1
cultures stared at: 1
sound good but: 1
now the headmaster's: 1
live just to: 1
and prodded but: 1
was his slogan: 1
the rhythm of: 1
the hero or: 1
but perhaps i: 1
ceasing to be: 1
failed dumbledore would: 1
you only for: 1
lord was probably: 1
great-great-great grandchild's hundredth: 1
you have to: 1
and dumbledore had: 1
left of them: 1
voice was starting: 1
dumbledore's opponent so: 1
harry said solemnly: 1
the worry was: 1
to his dark: 1
there was pleading: 1
you'd go down: 1
patronus a single: 1
end but then: 1
certainty in his: 1
actually knew that: 1
of professor quirrell's: 1
figure it out: 1
die i am: 1
give no reason: 1
his hands as: 1
immortality and they: 1
that went through: 1
i'd heard about: 1
those who say: 1
everything only to: 1
interesting people in: 1
after some internal: 1
quirrell his one-time: 1
on said harry: 1
studied with hermione: 1
reading the letters: 1
how would i: 1
would defeat the: 1
once more began: 1
i'd already seen: 1
dead and gone: 1
a tremendously powerful: 1
is no destiny: 1
any thought so: 1
be wise rather: 1
breath sank further: 1
and processed my: 1
old and wise: 1
mysterious conversation full: 1
death harry said: 1
significant reasons i'm: 1
smile you underestimate: 1
a flaw in: 1
why this should: 1
darker and more: 1
great tell me: 1
dead and not: 1
you stood in: 1
have a psychological: 1
seen and done: 1
then he sighed: 1
question for that: 1
sound like you: 1
had already started: 1
begging evil happens: 1
continued a young: 1
should there be: 1
the hood until: 1
trip to another: 1
more sober purple: 1
saying it out: 1
this is not: 1
somewhere there was: 1
to match his: 1
to encompass their: 1
who are overly: 1
closer across the: 1
there isn't anything: 1
truly with her: 1
before he realized: 1
a little dry: 1
evil and in: 1
which i wish: 1
of their madhouse: 1
then and i: 1
bleak road though: 1
time pretend that: 1
of ancientness about: 1
the headmaster gazed: 1
him came voldemort: 1
it would change: 1
the war it: 1
course of demanding: 1
sake of clear: 1
to save everyone: 1
be all sorts: 1
notes blurted harry: 1
especially not draco: 1
died she didn't: 1
ten years yes: 1
inside him and: 1
sharp repeated by: 1
have a soul: 1
to shake out: 1
as you put: 1
a little helpless: 1
a whole different: 1
of a great: 1
harry barely barely: 1
he already was: 1
harry in the: 1
said dumbledore looking: 1
that you remark: 1
experience than i: 1
ask if these: 1
would attempt to: 1
fingers drumming soundlessly: 1
it that way: 1
bad guy and: 1
get a chance: 1
me to pass: 1
and more numerous: 1
as he sank: 1
already started talking: 1
to be evil: 1
driven to grasp: 1
exist x not: 1
not in the: 1
starting to look: 1
the headmaster spread: 1
was horrified he: 1
do not mourn: 1
student would approach: 1
of yermy wibble's: 1
was probably just: 1
into the stone: 1
world and it: 1
breath meet all: 1
i wonder what: 1
sign but then: 1
advice i'll just: 1
harry didn't do: 1
others still live: 1
how the dark: 1
into a crystalline: 1
this muggle thing: 1
of the blow: 1
professor quirrell point: 1
sharp point with: 1
the barrier between: 1
to run through: 1
suppose his answer: 1
earring or something: 1
meet up with: 1
exactly one person: 1
of light to: 1
justice in it: 1
flitwick staring at: 1
our next great: 1
that you think: 1
dumbledore as he: 1
had come out: 1
and father -: 1
they could not: 1
through and never: 1
was laced with: 1
cage i will: 1
also be an: 1
house harry said: 1
surprised and flattered: 1
crystalline glass goldfish: 1
course only turned: 1
wasn't anything left: 1
trailed through a: 1
a selfish bastard: 1
so why would: 1
been unable to: 1
sure that he: 1
or make him: 1
forever it means: 1
i would rather: 1
up a crystal: 1
and said indeed: 1
them out the: 1
is an excuse: 1
than grindelwald's worst: 1
to sound a: 1
live so long: 1
not forget that: 1
trouble and so: 1
ever lost was: 1
other across a: 1
frowned then i: 1
harry you just: 1
without even having: 1
ball that seemed: 1
someone in the: 1
it had been: 1
yourself wrong i: 1
all three personally: 1
universe where horrible: 1
he didn't say: 1
had i given: 1
the universe was: 1
him now at: 1
you put it: 1
he put it: 1
of his ambition: 1
an excuse a: 1
wrinkled and old: 1
to a spot: 1
his voice trailed: 1
was peaceful i: 1
surface between it: 1
crept up the: 1
dark wizards better: 1
a wounded animal: 1
then harry sheepishly: 1
where they belong: 1
silly as that: 1
old wizard nodded: 1
here said the: 1
to come up: 1
grace the headmaster's: 1
enemies somehow even: 1
that fear so: 1
him now the: 1
i say that: 1
yet and right: 1
a friend and: 1
off before you're: 1
know the sad: 1
attempt to cast: 1
awareness or life: 1
dark wizard harry: 1
the repeated exposure: 1
it but this: 1
i know said: 1
in a hundred: 1
his classmates and: 1
just one but: 1
two hundred would: 1
is really calling: 1
i don't know: 1
the chair closed: 1
make me wish: 1
an iron certainty: 1
and somehow that: 1
like richard feynman: 1
harry with a: 1
for blindingly obvious: 1
his patronus a: 1
they are so: 1
the most sympathy: 1
sank into it: 1
with considerable irony: 1
anyone deliberately make: 1
afterward before the: 1
seriously there are: 1
to do would: 1
first headmaster let: 1
to harry i: 1
with the word: 1
why do evil: 1
watching my students: 1
harry had to: 1
thud how can: 1
awaiting their turn: 1
ravenclaw for backchat: 1
me and tell: 1
was an afterlife: 1
malfoy does not: 1
permanent damage past: 1
you the notes: 1
allotted span if: 1
most powerful wizard: 1
ancient eyes what: 1
even harry could: 1
the best of: 1
water glittered in: 1
hemisphere take away: 1
with heavy irony: 1
dumbledore looking more: 1
get wrinkled and: 1
cloak of invisibility: 1
his chin raised: 1
at it that: 1
things so that: 1
the reasoning abilities: 1
dementor the third: 1
since that was: 1
of letters a: 1
lucius was definitely: 1
to match professor: 1
stone all right: 1
they had all: 1
isn't anything i: 1
not know love: 1
wooden door the: 1
me for headmaster: 1
his beard out: 1

be a distraction: 1
went hard on: 1
that i'd never: 1
those without wands: 1

lord yet and: 1
purple than usual: 1
known better and: 1
was over and: 1

on old earth: 1
the ambition that: 1
because i've found: 1
i'm sorry headmaster: 1
so shocked he: 1
up and then: 1

very office cold: 1
i understand your: 1
they'd say no: 1
harry said dumbledore: 1
listened to you: 1
or rather demanded: 1
always in the: 1
but then after: 1
some reason while: 1
that i know: 1
harry was suddenly: 1
and his voice: 1
taking on a: 1
deadly crystalline clarity: 1
from a culture: 1
i not turn: 1
before you're allowed: 1
pattern matching without: 1
comprehension of me: 1
while still knowing: 1
dispel my patronus: 1
have occurred to: 1
suicide prevention hotline: 1
said dumbledore but: 1
it is not: 1
in a single: 1
history of europe: 1
thought he'd do: 1
you only imagine: 1
grow is a: 1
wear on me: 1
slightly i try: 1
being like that: 1
and just in: 1
highly mysterious circumstances: 1
insists on bringing: 1
more than years: 1
wizard rose from: 1
at the inside: 1
their damaged state: 1
left her lost: 1
his hand yes: 1
harry finished did: 1
in to teach: 1
he sighed how: 1
have answered my: 1
would rather not: 1
worse by far: 1
tried to communicate: 1
now the headmaster: 1
the constant and: 1
of annoyance the: 1
in draco malfoy's: 1
i fear what: 1
gestures to the: 1
after him came: 1
his forehead who: 1
on there is: 1
understand why why: 1
in front of: 1
and came up: 1
he couldn't even: 1
harry a little: 1
a culture where: 1
living and in: 1
as they tried: 1
do something about: 1
cliches completed by: 1
for now that: 1
would approach the: 1
pause slowly the: 1
from saying it: 1
go over to: 1
where to find: 1
impressed with harry's: 1
and gone forever: 1
stone so marked: 1
think you just: 1
souls if you: 1
horrible things were: 1
just bring in: 1
evil but they: 1
for wisdom who: 1
the headmaster's eyebrows: 1
is not a: 1
toot beep thud: 1
x not exist: 1
incredibly wise knockdown: 1
with a tinge: 1
dumbledore seemed far: 1
hallow already under: 1
to shreds so: 1
knew that my: 1
bubble beep thud: 1
willing to be: 1
all right said: 1
when you're not: 1
faded so you: 1
i am less: 1
was still a: 1
the midst of: 1
but there was: 1
seemed to focus: 1
the headmaster had: 1
people are twisted: 1
very straight his: 1
blindingly obvious cliches: 1
the letters and: 1
so marked do: 1
the dead person: 1
nine turned himself: 1
live the one: 1
heard in a: 1
emigrated to australia: 1
and old and: 1
young the old: 1
visit the headmaster: 1
than pitchest black: 1
head with a: 1
quietly his hand: 1
and test that: 1
the pain in: 1
bit of indignation: 1
malfoy's heart you: 1
indeed grindelwald was: 1
that you lied: 1
more numerous if: 1
is enough to: 1
a scientist does: 1
he paced slowly: 1
to hear too: 1
that nobody cried: 1
try to figure: 1
them so as: 1
mean all muggles: 1
ossifrage this had: 1
is completely in: 1
satisfied until harry: 1
corporeal patronuses maintained: 1
i really don't: 1
lot more hopeful: 1
match professor quirrell: 1
ahead but you: 1
for watching my: 1
harry again and: 1
dust but not: 1
i want the: 1
from the fear: 1
to another country: 1
everyone to die: 1
dumbledore would be: 1
why voldemort whirr: 1
no i do: 1
suffer any permanent: 1
laughing and dumbledore: 1
if i'm not: 1
to back the: 1
pajamas of a: 1
here in their: 1
defend against so: 1
silliest ideas i: 1
will be asking: 1
state or something: 1
you know anything: 1
the equations of: 1
woven of darkness: 1
test their skills: 1
nothing remains to: 1
and that thought: 1
professor mcgonagall that: 1
requiring human sacrifice: 1
headlines you are: 1
truncheon but if: 1
across his forehead: 1
logical tautologies like: 1
wisdom said harry: 1
and eaten dinner: 1
harry's voice was: 1
memory faded so: 1
will embrace death: 1
of magic that: 1
hardest time is: 1
and a line: 1
not have occurred: 1
souls at any: 1
harry from over: 1
back in the: 1
would dispel his: 1
i've found something: 1
the martial art: 1
you name yourself: 1
damage past dueling: 1
no not that: 1
has taken it: 1
chin raised high: 1
to himself i: 1
ghosts so when: 1
aliens rendezvous with: 1
innocence he was: 1
who'd originally told: 1
softly it is: 1
ha ha said: 1
you condemn my: 1
mean shouldn't it: 1
big monster with: 1
of house slytherin: 1
though he'd just: 1
patronus charm they: 1
stared at each: 1
equations of motion: 1
sacrifice i don't: 1
the inside and: 1
world didn't act: 1
it point three: 1
with the scar: 1
himself invisible and: 1
secret it was: 1
ancient wizards who: 1
no awareness or: 1
i have another: 1
the student would: 1
question no i: 1
father - harry: 1
have not read: 1
death of his: 1
a startled pause: 1
the truth was: 1
cross i don't: 1
other dark rituals: 1
to your hesitation: 1
nobody cried at: 1
had put a: 1
don't want everyone: 1
tautologies like all: 1
we lived in: 1
changed to an: 1
of hiroshima and: 1
wasn't that harry: 1
eighty harry's voice: 1
so driven to: 1
is a great: 1
underlined three times: 1
there is light: 1
said harry understand: 1
the older slytherins: 1
in the moment: 1
up toward the: 1
believed it himself: 1
forever proof by: 1
so you could: 1
came from a: 1
that's what death: 1
getting through here: 1
huge tragedies weren't: 1
the slytherin i: 1
dumbledore i suggest: 1
of which occasionally: 1
probably think you: 1
the universe for: 1
the others of: 1
wisdom who think: 1
dementor is a: 1
just let your: 1
to be truly: 1
already under highly: 1
hogwarts by an: 1
how to phrase: 1
was still alive: 1
owls but you: 1
for the greater: 1
the train then: 1
children thought i: 1
permitted to tarry: 1
stone archway old: 1
thought that everyone: 1
is up to: 1
veil you would: 1
supposed to magically: 1
harry's mind searched: 1
mean anything or: 1
sharpening a hufflepuff's: 1
in september when: 1
find out why: 1
brain's pattern-matching software: 1
fear death so: 1
place and none: 1
so old and: 1
clear communication very: 1
no no no: 1
this but i: 1
right off to: 1
her heart stayed: 1
personally known to: 1
the headmaster in: 1
love is more: 1
before the memory: 1
forehead and muttered: 1
have to think: 1
not a wooden: 1
tired as you: 1
would act if: 1
benefits to being: 1
on bringing in: 1
you tougher or: 1
read your mind: 1
find the resurrection: 1
a kind of: 1
sound like an: 1
before the student: 1
by the dementor: 1
than harry had: 1
may realize often: 1
adventure oh harry: 1
he was actually: 1
know that it: 1
software complete the: 1
material by the: 1
bring in an: 1
at harry from: 1
dead and how: 1
the dementor's cage: 1
me into allowing: 1
a complete copy: 1
mouth gaping open: 1
no one knows: 1
stood there gazing: 1
dark side as: 1
pain was still: 1
window by smiling: 1
the minds of: 1
professor quirrell more: 1
really fine after: 1
zabini's word and: 1
allowed to die: 1
- i did: 1
dumbledore frowning but: 1
single flicker of: 1
waiting by the: 1
the bottom of: 1
fear what this: 1
think said dumbledore: 1
and mild disapproval: 1
not say the: 1
evil deed not: 1
impossible to talk: 1
his voice for: 1
universe before it: 1
lost earring or: 1
dementor's cage with: 1
indecipherable script and: 1
said quietly professor: 1
soften the unintended: 1
was rather fonder: 1
opponent so it: 1
a good person: 1
that had sprung: 1
not just all: 1
into its stand: 1
frowning sternly that: 1
out a bit: 1
i i thought: 1
others of course: 1
too many of: 1
in his robes: 1
still lingering in: 1
stone could call: 1
a hundred times: 1
the days when: 1
those i have: 1
suppose i do: 1
dumbly harry awarded: 1
has not begun: 1
who he hurt: 1
there are those: 1
existence of souls: 1
gargoyle would be: 1
it for everyone: 1
is it that: 1
merely unable to: 1
peacefully i would: 1
for having hopes: 1
its core i: 1
of death pretend: 1
at say eighty: 1
heads with truncheons: 1
firmly it's life: 1
i could meet: 1
his pet hero: 1
infinitely darker caverns: 1
wasn't difficult it: 1
i am permitted: 1
if the pass: 1
parchment during charms: 1
school like he: 1
and it is: 1
seems like going: 1
just a selfish: 1
really dead and: 1
all politeness harry: 1
him at the: 1
twist your moral: 1
clear said harry: 1
i mean all: 1
the boy in: 1
considering that the: 1
just stood there: 1
is a bitter: 1
too greatly harry: 1
as he paced: 1
paused because this: 1
up out of: 1
without ceasing to: 1
and in the: 1
useful to those: 1
also be present: 1
caverns of their: 1
only allowed to: 1
afraid than i: 1
it also not: 1
back and i: 1
heart you know: 1
even for all: 1
live forever harry: 1
party around the: 1
as he should: 1
line dividing them: 1
death and i: 1
i have seen: 1
doesn't sound like: 1
i'm a lot: 1
and the silver-bearded: 1
if he even: 1
communicate and if: 1
five points no: 1
learned the words: 1
and not in: 1
see a flaw: 1
from the user's: 1
i had never: 1
and i think: 1
sure more so: 1
an even ten: 1
his hand a: 1
tell you his: 1
made by my: 1
other side of: 1
after they had: 1
or professor quirrell: 1
sacrifice their very: 1
understand why dumbledore: 1
was definitely a: 1
it harry still: 1
and wearily trudged: 1
could be done: 1
veil you could: 1
don't mean yesterday: 1
lined by more: 1
surrounding material by: 1
the incredulity in: 1
many dark rituals: 1
the pain was: 1
searched hastily for: 1
times stronger than: 1
before the day: 1
stones rippling always: 1
but still strong: 1
better than life: 1
go any colder: 1
face looked ancient: 1
simply puzzled though: 1
of a daze: 1
to imagine not: 1
to make him: 1
you refuse to: 1
said harry just: 1
fear death they: 1
where his silver: 1
night so that: 1
discarding wisdom for: 1
i mean said: 1
two of the: 1
time it drove: 1
himself from saying: 1
instead of making: 1
no destiny behind: 1
sake of evil: 1
evil dumbledore said: 1
you know when: 1
false hope again: 1
thought i could: 1
is a joy: 1
the same sense: 1
richard feynman had: 1
wish i had: 1
ever said that: 1
harry discarding wisdom: 1
tick ding puff: 1
stars don't care: 1
always in every: 1
considerable irony it: 1
little fiddly things: 1
where she left: 1
makes you care: 1
because they knew: 1
great adventure instead: 1
in the department: 1
can twist your: 1
abyss you have: 1
for it what's: 1
something else deeply: 1
want the secret: 1
greatly worried for: 1
the end there: 1
of his body: 1
immortality that requires: 1
would corrode that: 1
it is useful: 1
alive for watching: 1
as a friend: 1
honest and just: 1
harry shrugged well: 1
cast another corporeal: 1
that i'd heard: 1
starting to sound: 1
poor sweet myrtle: 1
of clear communication: 1
good side and: 1
too and you: 1
not die x: 1
wanting to bring: 1
any new insights: 1
just as tragically: 1
so easily have: 1
minds and predict: 1
lay in his: 1
a little too: 1
touched and enchanted: 1
cold rage at: 1
murder - well: 1
long moment then: 1
i suppose i: 1
asking that question: 1
fashion that it: 1
- harry whispered: 1
death is bad: 1
believe i know: 1
doing those things: 1
to start in: 1
should have realized: 1
hogwarts it developed: 1
warded in a: 1
yesterday's encounter with: 1
it is enough: 1
can imagine your: 1
dementor each time: 1
those amazing benefits: 1
had sprung to: 1
they'd emigrated to: 1
same sense i: 1
undelivered but i: 1
does what would: 1
born on old: 1
him to me: 1
be guarded dumbledore's: 1
constant and one-way: 1
in sudden realization: 1
believed it even: 1
to interact with: 1
and therefore always: 1
completely before the: 1
burst of magic: 1
crystalline clarity and: 1
ravenclaw harry said: 1
his voice biting: 1
sounded sad as: 1
voice was laced: 1
to anticipate my: 1
veil like the: 1
me defeat the: 1
this very office: 1
of hogwarts it: 1
have gone on: 1
your ability to: 1
slowly the old: 1
from this way: 1
in character for: 1
you tricked me: 1
a large salient: 1
through a lighted: 1
the dark wizards: 1
know when i: 1
muggle thing called: 1
ever really died: 1
ghosts do not: 1
turning spiral stairs: 1
harry don't tell: 1
the veil what: 1
it wasn't clear: 1
me too greatly: 1
had been accompanied: 1
generation the puzzle: 1
important than wisdom: 1
that was the: 1
go out and: 1
you a little: 1
even ten points: 1
insanity bwa ha: 1
was hard to: 1
of the soul: 1
worry was still: 1
headmaster spread his: 1
barely kept himself: 1
deeply wise to: 1
something then that's: 1
to visit the: 1
why had he: 1
scarlet like dried: 1
your soul could: 1
be any such: 1
become one with: 1
not why for: 1
visible dark mark: 1
you'd have me: 1
called cognitive dissonance: 1
headmaster nodded gravely: 1
evil i'm just: 1
now that i've: 1
though i can: 1
scientist and i'm: 1
idea for people: 1
with his wisdom: 1
if harry didn't: 1
be the worst: 1
quirrell's shoes what: 1
know love and: 1
the world read: 1
briefly appeared in: 1
i know for: 1
dark lord and: 1
face had grown: 1
chime glorp pop: 1
with a complete: 1
was what dumbledore: 1
that the defense: 1
they tried to: 1
wasn't feeling as: 1
of care that: 1
a dreadful fate: 1
to avoid all: 1
so if you: 1
brian dumbledore just: 1
him i defeated: 1
survived the death: 1
mirror the man: 1
a single flicker: 1
tall and coming: 1
hopeful now that: 1
on that sort: 1
desire but immortality: 1
dares not imagine: 1
over to the: 1
resurrection stone is: 1
why harry why: 1
this time he'd: 1
was harry ever: 1
on the days: 1
i mean harry: 1
positive integers if: 1
cast their own: 1
i suspect headmaster: 1
and calculate things: 1
too impressed with: 1
ideas i have: 1
the oaken door: 1
were evil dumbledore: 1
and this much: 1
is more important: 1
wants to save: 1
might be a: 1
- the annihilation: 1
it through from: 1
pretty soon there'd: 1
want him to: 1
be helping the: 1
proof by induction: 1
of incredibly wise: 1
stopped vibrating from: 1
that you were: 1
many things too: 1
had ever even: 1
he straightened and: 1
eaten dinner and: 1
and of course: 1
now and there: 1
was screaming very: 1
those things it'll: 1
wizard his face: 1
than usual thank: 1
went on the: 1
colder than he: 1
and yet i: 1
not have a: 1
students near just: 1
drifted into a: 1
yourself a scientist: 1
it was also: 1
the strange devices: 1
themselves it would: 1
drove him mad: 1
said everything about: 1
try to become: 1
archway kept in: 1
begun to wear: 1
i'd never seen: 1
the truth but: 1
them headmaster i: 1
of a good: 1
up to it: 1
he do it: 1
anyone know that: 1
the rejoinder in: 1
there myself to: 1
fast enough to: 1
out now harry: 1
more softly it: 1
very reasonable excuse: 1
if you only: 1
at funerals because: 1
much inside you: 1
the worst crime: 1
and everyone ought: 1
whispers barely on: 1
communication very bad: 1
a plot and: 1
do not have: 1
harry had lied: 1
the universe is: 1
greenish tinge that: 1
said see there's: 1
will be there: 1
conversation full of: 1
headmaster no term: 1
you truly desire: 1
with his patronus: 1
being tired as: 1
if they failed: 1
for you to: 1
went through him: 1
headmaster thought the: 1
the expense himself: 1
inside and a: 1
is not always: 1
just you waiting: 1
with anger and: 1
to make me: 1
hard evidence for: 1
a good sign: 1
are too young: 1
where horrible things: 1
monday and the: 1
hands where they: 1
and growing sad: 1
love as kindness: 1
it it is: 1
i have accepted: 1
feel himself enveloped: 1
him and you: 1
now even harry: 1
a scientist his: 1
let me put: 1
and tall and: 1
asked why dark: 1
demanding that outside: 1
its next great: 1
black surface of: 1
you not believe: 1
a slytherin's key: 1
back at the: 1
terrible thing that: 1
it because if: 1
know not what: 1
into nothingness then: 1
in faded scarlet: 1
it because it: 1
important as love: 1
been accompanied by: 1
have been defined: 1
your unique genius: 1
an answer the: 1
patronus charm himself: 1
then spat harry: 1
own patronus charm: 1
rose for a: 1
i am afraid: 1
before him and: 1
chance to meet: 1
and i will: 1
i'd begun to: 1
screaming very loudly: 1
from happening even: 1
kind of incredibly: 1
wizards could talk: 1
one whoosh hiss: 1
shaking his head: 1
presence of an: 1
why do dark: 1
to the left: 1
lingering in his: 1
and done a: 1
- bring them: 1
way of duplicating: 1
missed on our: 1
- no harry: 1
wizard i do: 1
or temporary -: 1
head of house: 1
of his brain: 1
powerful wizard the: 1
physical manifestation of: 1
anyone do any: 1
recited as best: 1
not draco malfoy: 1
wish to consult: 1
they would be: 1
that to respect: 1
far too impressed: 1
science said harry: 1
tally mark for: 1
take me for: 1
it also sounded: 1
wards - harry: 1
and the note: 1
a little sad: 1
i was crying: 1
of common sense: 1
now harry finished: 1
be an amazing: 1
from again that: 1
said with considerable: 1
killed himself to: 1
well i'm a: 1
any given time: 1
at his shoes: 1
their skills against: 1
have taken the: 1
it good with: 1
anger and worry: 1
got him the: 1
ones were still: 1
think that to: 1
the dark wizard: 1
thing dumbledore stared: 1
of myself uh: 1
gaping open dumbly: 1
if he did: 1
philosophers pretending to: 1
inscribed with the: 1
is the friend: 1
truth was that: 1
a lot easier: 1
name frowned thoughtfully: 1
very much made: 1
of me i: 1
the evidence but: 1
- this day: 1
frowning his fingers: 1
the headmaster how: 1
good sign but: 1
wizards better than: 1
harry the defense: 1
madness somehow harry: 1
know about how: 1
leliel and i: 1
to be sure: 1
overly impressed with: 1
drawn inside and: 1
to test the: 1
it does what: 1
professor mcgonagall when: 1
him i understood: 1
learn he offered: 1
gates of hogwarts: 1
i could have: 1
adventure instead of: 1
seek to hasten: 1
the right for: 1
when harry realized: 1
been like to: 1
plate inscribed with: 1
his smile you: 1
dark lord had: 1
invisibly time-turned as: 1
voice a little: 1
note underlined three: 1
you harry muttered: 1
and you go: 1
dad and their: 1
like you have: 1
stole the book: 1
that's bound to: 1
well indeed grindelwald: 1
not said the: 1
but immortality and: 1
is to elevate: 1
to talk to: 1
the hufflepuff and: 1
prove valuable to: 1
a frozen puff: 1
professor quirrell had: 1
a hufflepuff's bones: 1
entire monastery that: 1
souls pretend that: 1
hoped dumbledore would: 1
guarded warded in: 1
think i have: 1
who wants people: 1
obviously was what: 1
outside this country: 1
harry just to: 1
if dumbledore's patronus: 1
the numerals changed: 1
young man in: 1
realization you believe: 1
it who found: 1
and cannot ever: 1
young man is: 1
expecting ghosts so: 1
silver-bearded figure of: 1
place and it: 1
i am asking: 1
am not perfect: 1
lighted pool of: 1
professor quirrell believes: 1
the office stopped: 1
please listen the: 1
you are walking: 1
hood until he: 1
appear very solemn: 1
obvious cliches completed: 1
people had souls: 1
be very wise: 1
in the unlikely: 1
the impression wizards: 1
his voice sounded: 1
moral compass to: 1
was soft with: 1
rejoinder in such: 1
would be why: 1
had grown deeper: 1
or stars it: 1
is evil which: 1
human sacrifice i: 1
comfortable chair this: 1
from him to: 1
perhaps it will: 1
the end but: 1
can tell you: 1
to be honest: 1
and in something: 1

his mind before: 1
to consult harry: 1

won't ever forgive: 1
to rationalize it: 1
better dumbledore sighed: 1
aliens create aliens: 1
the headmaster his: 1
and and and: 1
place of argument: 1
people that would: 1
nature of consciousness: 1

not getting through: 1
i'm not sure: 1
during charms class: 1
actual dementor after: 1
not read your: 1
the headmaster's direction: 1
out later all: 1

a good idea: 1
makes the slytherin: 1
would ask that: 1
to him with: 1
their sacrifice and: 1
long you would: 1
i do believe: 1
in helplessness harry: 1
ever used in: 1
because this is: 1
in the presence: 1
a hint of: 1
still there you: 1
wearily trudged off: 1
cliche using whatever: 1

coming to a: 1
solid titanium bars: 1
single tiny bit: 1
wrote it down: 1
man i could: 1
headmaster how much: 1
ran out of: 1
voice rose no: 1
than i do: 1
letting them linger: 1
it is always: 1
far than grindelwald's: 1
sun or the: 1
of duplicating the: 1
that they will: 1
draco malfoy was: 1
to live the: 1
too many dark: 1
it can think: 1
wizard the old: 1
no let us: 1
to shield the: 1
remembered what it: 1

a lighted pool: 1
magically understand the: 1
and dad and: 1
asked you here: 1
say the first: 1
in it that: 1
you would do: 1
the dead calling: 1
right for the: 1
and now his: 1
seemed that elementary: 1
headmaster's voice was: 1
his feet once: 1
impressing ancient wizards: 1
the coming of: 1
of sense and: 1
advance with a: 1
headmaster everything at: 1
hear as they: 1
between the stones: 1
he'd hoped dumbledore: 1
helping the headmaster: 1
dementor again the: 1
afterlife instead of: 1
fairness in the: 1
long that it: 1
that wise old: 1
could try to: 1
in this very: 1
he found some: 1
me everything you: 1
death pretend headmaster: 1
day was over: 1
them harry the: 1
core i asked: 1

before his blood: 1
artistic ink drawing: 1
myself by my: 1
hug - this: 1
feynman had done: 1
at any given: 1
heard that theory: 1
the headmaster it: 1
side of comprehension: 1
dumbledore who would: 1
the presence of: 1
next time you: 1
i'm the one: 1
strong will to: 1
world read all: 1
them of course: 1
sorts of philosophers: 1
actually get in: 1
hear the voices: 1
he became a: 1
equally huge significant: 1
books and then: 1
asking him to: 1
this is madness: 1
himself a monster: 1
to phrase the: 1
can call death: 1
just tell the: 1
instead of putting: 1
harry had ever: 1
called a suicide: 1
silver beard unnoticed: 1
how my parents: 1
- and then: 1
to learn he: 1
ahead and tell: 1
day therefore i: 1
well i'd better: 1
their own patronus: 1
fools had ever: 1
thing like a: 1
say anything surprising: 1
that accompanies the: 1
true-forged in time: 1
forehead tell me: 1
so silly as: 1
wands said dumbledore: 1
before i would: 1
shaking water droplets: 1
sure i can: 1
horror for the: 1
things of the: 1
the chair in: 1
everything it wouldn't: 1

harry hadn't been: 1
harry's voice went: 1
makes you happier: 1
toot puff tinkle: 1

yourself so harry: 1
the grounds by: 1
wondered to myself: 1
calling in whispers: 1
even feel flattered: 1
to every student: 1
and well we: 1
him sternly the: 1
a party on: 1
i think said: 1
the moon celebrate: 1
the sort of: 1
how it is: 1
australia back in: 1

the heads with: 1
september when i: 1
all harry please: 1
voice the old: 1
said that they: 1
dead - then: 1
summon them that: 1
squeamish ossifrage this: 1
step closer across: 1
a cage of: 1
i know though: 1
i'd better go: 1
wouldn't just tell: 1
believe that i: 1
now in dumbledore's: 1
could have been: 1
from his last: 1
up as a: 1
do not learn: 1
they sounded profound: 1
console themselves it: 1
he committed acts: 1
that harry there: 1
harry yes said: 1
always willing to: 1
the headmaster at: 1
tight with anger: 1
like all x: 1
what this disbelief: 1
a time dumbledore: 1
the headmaster thought: 1
it what's the: 1
rising but let's: 1
grindelwald and him: 1
of his mysterious: 1
bastard who didn't: 1
only to hold: 1
you've got to: 1
with an explanation: 1
loud all right: 1
the hypothesis was: 1
tongue fast enough: 1
resurrection stone all: 1
the headmaster's eyes: 1
own making without: 1
processed my words: 1
of a ritual: 1
run and run: 1
further into the: 1
head they could: 1
many of those: 1
and said there: 1
answer the headmaster: 1
face was gentle: 1
and tell me: 1
knew that death: 1
the walls of: 1
that sort of: 1
malfoy that he: 1
as he tore: 1
of throwing them: 1
live headmaster harry: 1
hermione and she: 1
not being tired: 1
said dumbledore there: 1
it if i'm: 1
from king's cross: 1
wise old fools: 1

pleading in the: 1
the wizarding world: 1
harry whispered dumbledore: 1
hiss pffft whirr: 1
they will sacrifice: 1
to think it: 1
are meant to: 1
been lost for: 1
of their own: 1
if you didn't: 1
why not said: 1
the skins of: 1
small voice of: 1
compass to point: 1
wasn't clear said: 1
the crazy headmaster: 1
to kill him: 1
even trying to: 1
a sharp point: 1
just all wizards: 1
how about if: 1
on that one: 1
destroying a soul: 1
hands as though: 1
on and at: 1
my first grandchild's: 1
by the dementor's: 1
one harry was: 1
and none of: 1
suggested to you: 1
passage of the: 1
to communicate and: 1
dumbledore told harry: 1
like that will: 1
to stop himself: 1
around telling the: 1
out and i: 1
if these are: 1
upon others is: 1
going to live: 1
we both know: 1
waiting eyes well: 1
never get a: 1
the hands briefly: 1

really dumb i: 1
deathly hallow already: 1
i the two: 1
realized that there: 1
coming of night: 1
behind two corporeal: 1
resurrection stone could: 1

too young harry: 1
someone built a: 1
combat conditions wanting: 1
do to you: 1

accustomed to living: 1
reason while one: 1

with poisonous fangs: 1
now that there: 1
the silliest ideas: 1
my friends nor: 1

wooden stool and: 1
on intercepting my: 1
begun to call: 1

of those letters: 1
and ask her: 1
though there was: 1
obviously i'm not: 1
watch the sun: 1
wizard began to: 1
other children thought: 1
the cold rage: 1
call back his: 1
than of dumbledore: 1
remaining for them: 1
the student could: 1
easily have been: 1
but your comprehension: 1

your life could: 1
as kindness as: 1
some internal debate: 1
time i dispel: 1

i'm not getting: 1
be most extremely: 1
equal of voldemort: 1
exposed upon his: 1
cunning which had: 1
it wouldn't matter: 1
great big monster: 1
martial art he'd: 1
rationalize it away: 1
under realistic combat: 1
said quietly oh: 1
the glass things: 1
a distraction harry: 1
powerful monster -: 1
she said that: 1
a fiddly thing: 1
dumbledore shaking water: 1
occurred to you: 1
and got almost: 1
i know it: 1
real plot will: 1

everyone ought to: 1
with a strange: 1
very strong will: 1
it be you: 1
their madhouse of: 1
just go around: 1
managing to appear: 1

hitler had been: 1
old wizard will: 1
on cliches good: 1
that one whoosh: 1
but the dead: 1
i still don't: 1
the beginning he: 1
disagreements aside what: 1

more rituals in: 1
wizard his feet: 1
what is it: 1
brain was gone: 1
and and the: 1
to learn enough: 1
just going somewhere: 1

the curtains were: 1
harry had given: 1
defense professor lifted: 1
after while thoughtful: 1
something whose name: 1
about being boring: 1

time mr potter: 1
like headmaster's style: 1
that existence an: 1
life nor could: 1
resurrection stone is: 1
the room had: 1
after death which: 1
long enough or: 1
believe as speaks: 1
said harry his: 1
spoke dumbledore that: 1
his teacup there: 1
resurrection stone front: 1
quirrell shrugged sipped: 1
so much as: 1
was hurt in: 1
afterlife is obvious: 1
seems indistinguishable memory: 1
could possibly with: 1
put out discover: 1
frown his face: 1
few questions merlin: 1
kept silent long: 1
said after while: 1
comed-tea first even: 1
harry said hastily: 1
problem harry looked: 1
own tea sat: 1
can't quite visualize: 1
mere wizardry there: 1
frustrated whatever's going: 1
tea again he: 1
seeming first like: 1
is in doubt: 1
even taking into: 1
professor quirrell still: 1
headmaster about your: 1
tea only asked: 1
diagon alley i: 1
case mr potter: 1
thoughtful frown his: 1
it does talk: 1
headmaster can very: 1
can recall professor: 1
something colder more: 1
the dead these: 1
though i wouldn't: 1
an afterlife is: 1
malfoy please try: 1
dumbledore does truly: 1
had them the: 1
that's actually an: 1
you believe there's: 1
was drawn thoughtful: 1
defense professor laughed: 1
indeed certain useful: 1
was dry thin: 1
great deal effort: 1
between and his: 1
the tablecloth professor: 1
opponent said professor: 1
much like an: 1
floating obligingly across: 1
me what i: 1
boring he didn't: 1
the defense professor's: 1
contemplative mood saturday: 1
glimmering it curtains: 1
his teacup back: 1
was want immortality: 1
draw back fold: 1
so was harry: 1
possibly-ultra-high-quality perhaps-ridiculously-expensive chinese: 1
up hopefully that: 1
around atlantis quite: 1
quite said professor: 1
was the defense: 1
which are known: 1
fold into itself: 1
i hope has: 1
peaceful pattern seeming: 1
defense professor raised: 1
into account harry: 1
there's an afterlife: 1
appreciate just mess: 1
professor quirrell returned: 1
draco which had: 1
teacup there is: 1
is he never: 1
intelligent mr potter: 1
quirrell had corrected: 1
the bill last: 1
second i should: 1
sip his own: 1
suggest obvious idea: 1
tell no secrets: 1
had maneuvered himself: 1
itself off coatrack: 1
lips again before: 1
forever the afterlife: 1
his skin and: 1
mr potter i'm: 1
let him get: 1
his coat would: 1
look far more: 1
they just said: 1
know i a: 1
similar warning draco: 1
an impostor pretending: 1
there are certain: 1
believe there's an: 1
like ice the: 1
so your own: 1
more long seconds: 1
up his teacup: 1
cloak and before: 1
about resurrection stone: 1
there is mr: 1
seen stone a: 1
conflict between and: 1
suddenly is there: 1
actually harry said: 1
all wizards their: 1
so may take: 1
memory because is: 1
own best guess: 1
spirits tell no: 1
known the wielder: 1
floating back harry: 1
wishful thinking you: 1
harry had dropped: 1
your own best: 1
many claims the: 1
secrets knew life: 1
finally made connection: 1
produce among those: 1
floating toward defense: 1
professor lifted up: 1
professor quirrell was: 1
is next great: 1
hover charm saucer: 1
saucer some those: 1
potter i'm sorry: 1
matter myself there: 1
are certain devices: 1
in which case: 1
long wide table: 1
'the sky is: 1
his eyes you: 1
suspect only project: 1
becoming visible the: 1
if mr malfoy: 1
time all britain: 1
studied harry's tea-saucer: 1
away everything abandon: 1
happen see stone: 1
harry wanted them: 1
his own claim: 1
is something else: 1
kills draco makes: 1
could take out: 1
asked it a: 1
game take vengeance: 1
might like all: 1
let stand there: 1
really just ordinary: 1
sounded very calm: 1
in doubt there: 1
words professor quirrell: 1
very calm tone: 1
had neglected notice: 1
abandon his game: 1
hope fear would: 1
perceive said voice: 1
obligingly across table: 1
no a chance: 1
back a similar: 1
compromised his principles: 1
quirrell harry's mind: 1
seat the same: 1
kedavra the defense: 1
natural elegant the: 1
harry looked up: 1
still been shocked: 1
an afterlife harry: 1
not you believe: 1
had dropped his: 1
first even taking: 1
claimed have an: 1
harry get it: 1
them then harry's: 1
seemed had neglected: 1
was a contemplative: 1
absently as did: 1
say 'i strongly: 1
tea harry sipped: 1
reports whose veracity: 1
the mind result: 1
ever seen stone: 1
these i suspect: 1
see faint tracery: 1
seemed be becoming: 1
any more hints: 1
quirrell though i: 1
whatever's going wrong: 1
his eyes his: 1
is their chessboard: 1
breeze professor quirrell: 1
toward defense professor: 1
hopefully that saw: 1
to suggest obvious: 1
dry thin smile: 1
symbol he'd drawn: 1
very persuasive mr: 1
into getting glimpse: 1
inside his head: 1
cynical yet mr: 1
next time mr: 1
tone i would: 1
that said harry: 1
until finally harry: 1
the sky being: 1
back harry harry: 1
i looked into: 1
head i don't: 1
the alleged spirits: 1
is why resurrection: 1
death is next: 1
feel unappreciative in: 1
way mr potter: 1
afterlife what people: 1
a small high-pitched: 1
tablecloth professor quirrell's: 1
see any conflict: 1
table was centerpiece: 1
when harry felt: 1
immortality that's actually: 1
world said harry: 1
a similar warning: 1
harry had still: 1
there was dry: 1
finished his own: 1
before claimed have: 1
vengeance you if: 1
had mental model: 1
i did lucius: 1
his head i: 1
mr potter harry: 1
cold cold smile: 1
far more natural: 1
stone front dumbledore: 1
afterlife let me: 1
saucer noting absently: 1
short today's visit: 1
distant his eyes: 1
visualize what must: 1
was be ridiculously: 1
would extremely put: 1
if i did: 1
heads yes said: 1
think faster next: 1
you believe an: 1
his game take: 1
solves problem harry: 1
my guesses so: 1
get me that: 1
i mean besides: 1
potter i hope: 1
some fool plot: 1
pattern a dim: 1
think headmaster believed: 1
all much maybe: 1
take that existence: 1
best guess without: 1
well i take: 1
carefully not you: 1
said communicate the: 1
nobody actually liked: 1
lifted itself off: 1
only asked it: 1
quirrell then defense: 1
last question harry: 1
lucius sacrifices his: 1
a silent breeze: 1
just ordinary tea: 1
notice professor quirrell: 1
get it was: 1
his tea harry: 1
harry felt very: 1
harry said suddenly: 1
an impulse drink: 1
chessboard all wizards: 1
mr potter it: 1
obvious idea about: 1
it curtains the: 1
much maybe nobody: 1
knew life nor: 1
well is there: 1
face then harry: 1
being boring he: 1
lips something colder: 1
i find frustrating: 1
needed demonstrate three: 1
very much like: 1
was around atlantis: 1
life some fool: 1
were taking a: 1
connection he frowned: 1
looked up hopefully: 1
warning draco which: 1
wanted them then: 1
it long enough: 1
against dumbledore get: 1
even pronounce or: 1
yes said icy: 1
alleged spirits tell: 1
indistinguishable memory because: 1
before answering his: 1
exactly correct way: 1
the symbol he'd: 1
quirrell's voice sounded: 1
symbol had seen: 1
was there by: 1
gave me usual: 1
fast enough to: 1
had vanished if: 1
throw away everything: 1
coat would i: 1
becoming cynical yet: 1
great adventure i: 1
guesses so much: 1
had let him: 1
own cup making: 1
thing when talking: 1
no said harry: 1
trust my guesses: 1
said meekly i: 1
myself there been: 1
said harry it: 1
made harry say: 1
went floating back: 1
harry said as: 1
try there was: 1
curtains the room: 1
his game against: 1
liked tea the: 1
the world said: 1
said 'the sky: 1
little harry said: 1
deal effort their: 1
buying ridiculously expensive: 1
professor quirrell's presence: 1
shimmer as though: 1
he asked me: 1
the beginning are: 1
believed didn't seem: 1
principles it is: 1
those wizards were: 1
professor quirrell at: 1
harry couldn't even: 1
put fake gigantic: 1
professor quirrell as: 1
ice the other: 1
afterlife simply is: 1
don't see there: 1
mind flashed back: 1
once did so: 1
wizards were reasonably: 1
first like plain: 1
toward professor quirrell: 1
mind finally made: 1
it he'd felt: 1
said should have: 1
which had made: 1
the wielder -: 1
had chosen question: 1
glimpse the bill: 1
defense professor's face: 1
long enough started: 1
quirrell as shrugged: 1
the room seemed: 1
all people didn't: 1
expensive tea harry: 1
the tablecloth spread: 1
or kept silent: 1
did lucius sacrifices: 1
potter it took: 1
a moment then: 1
vanished if happen: 1
sort which hope: 1
inside his cloak: 1
he frowned dumbledore: 1
cunning professor quirrell's: 1
professor quirrell's coat: 1
later saucer went: 1
don't think headmaster: 1
same thing professor: 1
as though finish: 1
dumbledore's opponent said: 1
certain useful spell: 1
make victim feel: 1
see stone that: 1
his head a: 1
coatrack went floating: 1
possibly with eternity: 1
me a second: 1
a dim tracery: 1
curtains were taking: 1
a moment later: 1
frowned dumbledore kills: 1
is obvious i: 1
the world i: 1
he'd drawn had: 1
didn't fool me: 1
answer harry observed: 1
looked into matter: 1
a second i: 1
teacup back the: 1
that death is: 1
hints that harry: 1
took sip his: 1
deathly chill seemed: 1
faint tracery flowers: 1
there any way: 1
then harry's mind: 1
plain cloth if: 1
his current curriculum: 1
everything abandon his: 1
just mess him: 1
you spoke dumbledore: 1
let me know: 1
spread over table: 1
there is nothing: 1
the afterlife let: 1
were times when: 1
impostor pretending be: 1
quirrell said after: 1
consider lord malfoy: 1
same time as: 1
professor quirrell wasn't: 1
back the saucer: 1
got i mean: 1
finally harry had: 1
should have told: 1
unappreciative in fact: 1
code they put: 1
went floating obligingly: 1
guess without any: 1
harry's mind professor: 1
mary's room professor: 1
beginning are becoming: 1
out discover the: 1
wielder - which: 1
bill last time: 1
said suddenly is: 1
never mind let: 1
room professor quirrell: 1
fact maybe was: 1
has compromised his: 1
quirrell still that: 1
no professor quirrell: 1
didn't say 'i: 1
mean besides avada: 1
believe the sky: 1
took more long: 1
really believed didn't: 1
that very calm: 1
harry it does: 1
didn't seem them: 1
eternity gave me: 1
obvious i looked: 1
said icy voice: 1
face that is: 1
spell which solves: 1
that symbol said: 1
how awful was: 1
immortal soul in: 1
the sort which: 1
did so your: 1
centerpiece mary's room: 1
lord malfoy threatened: 1
stand there is: 1
eyes his teacup: 1
table was a: 1
himself into getting: 1
correct way professor: 1
draco makes look: 1
i'm certainly becoming: 1
whose veracity is: 1
he didn't seem: 1
line inside circle: 1
set down his: 1
afterlife the temperature: 1
harry put his: 1
the inside his: 1
been many claims: 1
without any wishful: 1
strongly believe the: 1
quirrell's coat lifted: 1
back fold into: 1
had made harry: 1
are becoming cynical: 1
stone a line: 1
harry nodded the: 1
room had changed: 1
pieces consider lord: 1
throw away your: 1
a contemplative mood: 1
didn't anyway harry: 1
your life some: 1
have told headmaster: 1

harry holding tea: 1
said he sipped: 1
up harry had: 1
which is why: 1
voice like ice: 1
own tea again: 1
all britain is: 1

about how awful: 1
stone harry set: 1
that harry wanted: 1
professor quirrell set: 1
professor laughed harry: 1
map the world: 1
which could be: 1
is nothing which: 1
among those reports: 1
maneuvered himself into: 1
taking a faintly: 1
so the symbol: 1
now seemed be: 1
that apparently was: 1
aside his teacup: 1
artifact the world: 1
was far above: 1
anyone who was: 1
thoughtful if there: 1
their searches immortality: 1
style professor quirrell: 1
alley i was: 1
over table was: 1
enough to suggest: 1
knew was deliberately: 1
didn't seem see: 1

professor magic is: 1
like plain cloth: 1

hastily i did: 1
cup his lips: 1
silent long enough: 1

the tea itself: 1
the world just: 1
could be result: 1
dim tracery elaborate: 1
was really just: 1
neglected notice professor: 1
be ridiculously expensive: 1
i once did: 1
seemed draw back: 1
idea about resurrection: 1
nodded the curtains: 1
drink comed-tea first: 1
afterlife harry had: 1
like beliefs all: 1
what must been: 1
a very peaceful: 1

triangle the deathly: 1
the same time: 1
a little harry: 1

chinese tea i'm: 1
seconds harry get: 1
seemed shimmer as: 1

harry's mind flashed: 1
tea sat silence: 1
professor quirrell though: 1
teacup a small: 1
most valuable magical: 1
took small careful: 1
there were times: 1
way professor quirrell: 1
speaks it is: 1
demonstrate three times: 1
talk the afterlife: 1
quirrell's presence lord: 1
small careful sip: 1
inside circle inside: 1
last what was: 1
soul in fact: 1
lecture about how: 1
certain devices said: 1
which case mr: 1
quite few wizards: 1
me whole long: 1

as well is: 1
his cup his: 1
drawn had vanished: 1
an image the: 1
harry got i: 1

threatened throw away: 1
that is resurrection: 1
resurrection stone harry: 1
still that very: 1
is blue' your: 1
him until finally: 1
charm saucer went: 1
expensive make victim: 1
drawn thoughtful no: 1
please try think: 1
then rose his: 1
him like well: 1
hope has persuaded: 1
there by way: 1
wandless stuff that: 1
next great adventure: 1
is indeed certain: 1
couldn't appreciate just: 1
magical artifact the: 1
raised his cup: 1
point it was: 1
tried repeat chinese: 1
thing professor quirrell: 1
enough or kept: 1
persuaded heck no: 1
smile his lips: 1
wizards wasted great: 1
maybe nobody actually: 1
awful was want: 1
it was clear: 1
set aside his: 1
dead these i: 1
room seemed be: 1
times when harry: 1
people didn't say: 1
elegant the tea: 1
whose name harry: 1
wasted great deal: 1
there is indeed: 1
by way mr: 1
would - never: 1
quiet nagging suspicion: 1
be becoming visible: 1
i suspect only: 1
or anyone who: 1
been going inside: 1
quirrell had needed: 1
into itself as: 1
again before answering: 1
laughed harry didn't: 1
harry couldn't appreciate: 1
stuff that apparently: 1
silence the tablecloth: 1
headmaster's style professor: 1
if happen see: 1
world i no: 1
like all much: 1
own tea then: 1
being blue ': 1
valuable magical artifact: 1
going wrong people's: 1
had convinced to: 1
was a very: 1
could learned after: 1
recall professor quirrell: 1
which hope fear: 1
look like i: 1
impulse drink comed-tea: 1
own claim have: 1
afterlife if i: 1
like well tea: 1
teacup a little: 1
then quite few: 1
harry had chosen: 1
model himself continuing: 1
other end the: 1
fear would expected: 1
quirrell at least: 1
convinced to throw: 1
game against dumbledore: 1
his lips again: 1
the table dumbledore: 1
high-pitched tacking sound: 1
blue pattern a: 1
an afterlife simply: 1
was quiet nagging: 1
his lips something: 1
people's heads yes: 1
into matter myself: 1
are known the: 1
down his teacup: 1
sort thing when: 1
an afterlife if: 1
quirrell then quite: 1
only project an: 1
noting absently as: 1

lord malfoy is: 1
is there any: 1
notice sort thing: 1
learned now notice: 1
sipped his tea: 1
like an impostor: 1
tea-saucer a moment: 1
harry set aside: 1
does truly believe: 1
wizards their pieces: 1
have ever seen: 1
image the mind: 1
shocked out his: 1
seen the inside: 1
any conflict between: 1
anyway harry said: 1
dumbledore get me: 1

silent breeze professor: 1
professor quirrell knew: 1
them like beliefs: 1
i take harry: 1
with eternity gave: 1

hermione said her: 2
the same time: 2
i don't think: 2
said professor quirrell: 2
i don't want: 2
a hero hermione: 2
while she was: 2
professor quirrell's gaze: 2
said the old: 2
staring at her: 2
a moment to: 2
over and over: 2
have an ambition: 2
and stepped back: 2
that wasn't the: 2
tell me miss: 2
on the stone: 2
from behind her: 2
her as though: 2
the boy prefects: 2
through the corridor: 2
the other girls: 2

if you were: 2
rock as it: 2
as though they: 2
said the defense: 2
to imply that: 2
quaver in her: 2
quirrell who was: 2

- and they: 2
professor mcgonagall and: 2
as it moved: 2
huge ugly figures: 2
said penelope clearwater: 2
to be thinking: 2

on her face: 2

percival wulfric brian: 2
the correct answer: 2
it moved like: 2
she had to: 2
like rock as: 2
their wings back: 2
great gargoyles folded: 2
ugly figures waited: 2
had wanted to: 2
seemed to be: 2
professor quirrell who: 2
place and stepped: 2
after that but: 2
to take over: 2
mean to imply: 2
miss granger's account: 2

defense professor turned: 1
couldn't have managed: 1
really said miss: 1
do all the: 1
or putting down: 1
turned back to: 1
the reaction of: 1
her phrase was: 1
what professor mcgonagall: 1
she said as: 1
a slight overtone: 1
again - it: 1
you need ambition: 1
granger's accusations were: 1
english translation anyway: 1
us from each: 1
you that you: 1
the words well: 1

that can happen: 1
- tell me: 1
the shoulder just: 1
it is futile: 1
made a sort: 1
from where he: 1
me that she: 1

heroes then turned: 1
fires of her: 1

solidly behind her: 1
that wizards don't: 1
all the emotion: 1
his hand on: 1
at 7pm would: 1
it over and: 1
each house so: 1
the supreme mugwump: 1
at 7 15pm: 1

so although a: 1
headmaster set fire: 1
me to ask: 1
at around the: 1

such ordinary folk: 1
all these ancient: 1

it up means: 1
paving of hogwarts's: 1
how many heroes: 1

was still dark: 1
positions only one: 1
society and everything: 1
enough to do: 1
turned his head: 1
but leave that: 1
see why the: 1
from the headmaster's: 1
what's right over: 1
headmaster doesn't even: 1
pointing to a: 1
and walked away: 1
his head face: 1
looked at supreme: 1

the door minerva: 1
smiled benevolently at: 1
give up no: 1
headmaster's office so: 1
tacking sounds on: 1
muggleborn stood the: 1

translation anyway she: 1
come out even: 1
donation to your: 1
point of being: 1
care what professor: 1
be right about: 1
spoken came professor: 1
hogwarts was solid: 1
back in his: 1
smelled the chicken: 1
no it's all: 1
eyes still looking: 1
taken thirty inches: 1
decided to be: 1

her head held: 1
making her look: 1
if you want: 1
of magic and: 1
more of them: 1
amazement the way: 1
come just professor: 1
corridors i mean: 1
by now -: 1
when he'd first: 1
take from him: 1
i think that's: 1
increase their number: 1

she couldn't do: 1
that you did: 1
protest because you're: 1
there are children: 1
members to don: 1

them for a: 1
would teach charms: 1
aurors but not: 1
professors again professor: 1
awful to tell: 1
form but she: 1
the protest but: 1
several people twitch: 1
mcgonagall said briskly: 1
that'll all come: 1
or mostly wizards: 1
twelve uses of: 1
ordinary existences when: 1
became heroes i: 1
are children present: 1
said susan dumbledore: 1
right and they're: 1
hero they will: 1
over then again: 1
man a love: 1

shaking his head: 1
hogwarts witches and: 1

parvati so now: 1
then a hero: 1
granger you cannot: 1
wasn't a lot: 1
but i don't: 1
regiment who was: 1
matter what but: 1
looked hideous if: 1
forth a small: 1
other people exclaiming: 1
and taken out: 1
did not look: 1
reflection oh now: 1
it is by: 1
how very easy: 1
breath or putting: 1
i'd think that: 1
after some careful: 1
are hopeless is: 1
voice wavered but: 1
the enchantment of: 1
said it i: 1
professor mcgonagall some: 1
saw that harry: 1
break your bounds: 1
at her fewer: 1
were a few: 1
rapidly so he: 1
if miss granger's: 1
behind her minerva: 1
unsupportive attitude -: 1
headmaster smiled benevolently: 1
recognize that she'd: 1
vector's voice from: 1
it by now: 1
means we can: 1
insane laughter that's: 1
misunderstanding i did: 1
professor sinistra the: 1
quirrell leaned back: 1
of the world: 1
low and grim: 1
i did not: 1
said i should: 1
girls none of: 1
oaken door shut: 1

the astronomy professor's: 1
were a bit: 1
totally would not: 1
exclaiming things at: 1
to the sound: 1
that aside tell: 1
only about rivaling: 1
think you need: 1
holding it against: 1
two people present: 1
before that it: 1
it can be: 1
you weren't very: 1
class no longer: 1
a problem so: 1
charms you cannot: 1
her shoes making: 1
time for us: 1
right over and: 1
a solid wooden: 1
said quietly he: 1
frowning you explained: 1
i should be: 1
one course without: 1
bellatrix black and: 1
was another sentence: 1
to refuse that: 1
found a problem: 1
the girls tracey: 1
course said professor: 1
of hogwarts was: 1
books on how: 1
said such is: 1
feeling a bit: 1
to me it: 1
there were more: 1

for reasons like: 1
the girl quite: 1
but hermione was: 1
you never do: 1
emotion that wasn't: 1
squeaked the high: 1
might be discouraging: 1
bit larger than: 1
got all these: 1
miss granger had: 1
many boys and: 1
will grasp at: 1
she said yes: 1
that is not: 1

his hands toyed: 1

heavier and heavier: 1
or something transfigured: 1
guy more conversation: 1
did not truly: 1
weren't very encouraging: 1
hermione jean granger: 1
infinitely too awful: 1
speaking up so: 1
managed at this: 1
vanquisher of the: 1
he replied not: 1
of good person: 1
a few more: 1
ought to carry: 1
the gap closed: 1
defying authority after: 1
was looking a: 1
no sign that: 1
of such things: 1
albus's desk and: 1
leaning with his: 1
was rare that: 1
on breathing slowly: 1
perhaps it is: 1
trouble some of: 1
granger padma patil: 1
away to the: 1
or the english: 1
in the slightest: 1

instead of hyperventilating: 1
them had continued: 1
i don't there: 1
weakly the hufflepuff: 1
and i didn't: 1
point is moot: 1
hermione said she: 1
started to imagine: 1
very few folk: 1

just stared at: 1
wizard said slowly: 1

sudden hush the: 1
and she'd been: 1
for being a: 1
was feeling a: 1
creatures or people: 1
us if we: 1
like a hint: 1
at her the: 1
mcgonagall continued so: 1
serious making her: 1
stair then the: 1
he's sort of: 1
listening she'd never: 1
trying not to: 1
take a moment: 1
many heroes came: 1

a contemplative look: 1
brief bwa-ha-ha echoing: 1
eight founding members: 1
with the words: 1
ordinary folk leading: 1

a little high: 1
after a while: 1
a hint to: 1

and professor flitwick: 1

his wrinkle-lined eyes: 1
took back the: 1
professor sinistra but: 1
by half finished: 1
few folk ever: 1
been around her: 1

their heart had: 1

it was clear: 1
every word the: 1
they're not too: 1

than any dare: 1
course the eight: 1
maybe if there: 1
do anything interesting: 1
said rapidly so: 1
eyes darting to: 1
her professor sinistra: 1
trying that without: 1
so far professors: 1
albus said professor: 1
wand the gargoyles: 1
right said lavender: 1
she glanced behind: 1
- mr potter: 1
to their shelves: 1

sort of peeping: 1
hero hermione had: 1
famous dark wizard: 1
heroic i mean: 1
we all still: 1
to you but: 1
a battle until: 1
she'd imagined when: 1

so far sold: 1
were several other: 1
polite and face: 1
daphne greengrass minerva: 1
i mean you: 1
sinistra snapped and: 1
to be frightened: 1
comes for them: 1

had done the: 1
the headmaster said: 1

house points or: 1

half finished professor: 1
professor flitwick who: 1
say it hermione: 1
said not to: 1
time i can: 1
hogwarts were there: 1
mcgonagall some do: 1
themselves of course: 1
gryffindor that was: 1
daphne in a: 1
i mean people: 1
undisguised fascination they: 1
are heroes in: 1
it had probably: 1
have told none: 1
we've got all: 1
and concentrated on: 1
buttons behind them: 1
both those famed: 1
away from tracey: 1
the english translation: 1
close to professor: 1
of her vision: 1
now called heroes: 1
idly tossing it: 1
hufflepuff girl seemed: 1
extremely reluctant um: 1
on when all: 1
way she'd started: 1
wrong heroes are: 1
breaking the bounds: 1
think you just: 1
was doing it: 1
gave it a: 1
but still but: 1
can be learned: 1
i have told: 1
in them everyone: 1
still dark and: 1
other high position: 1
that's how men: 1
existence then professor: 1
was stalking through: 1
just you hermione: 1
it - and: 1
back the button: 1
sounding puzzled um: 1
thirty inches by: 1
to do all: 1
granger said the: 1
no great ambition: 1
mostly witches or: 1
sure that no: 1
drove you to: 1
harry potter hadn't: 1
door shut solidly: 1
nobody's sidekick and: 1
to professor vector: 1
not be a: 1
quirrell just talks: 1
chaos wants to: 1
girls playing games: 1
all right said: 1
lord grindelwald and: 1
off hermione wondered: 1
professor sinistra and: 1
i looked at: 1
leading ordinary existences: 1
hogwarts right to: 1
why that's brilliant: 1
initials s p: 1
if you had: 1
emphatic about nobody: 1
about being not: 1
heroes now that: 1
briefly dead gray: 1
defense professor his: 1
of minutes professor: 1
your reckoning but: 1
my donation to: 1
just too much: 1
voice of professor: 1
considering its reflection: 1
gave a small: 1
was something in: 1
was helpless to: 1
would be to: 1
are turning away: 1
to see if: 1
not thereby rise: 1
hermione gave a: 1
it he doesn't: 1
stop them nor: 1
say it's just: 1
eyes the defense: 1
it what exactly: 1
the high stern: 1
well maybe people: 1
only briefly dead: 1
the small nod: 1
might be possible: 1
silver backside and: 1
tracey indignantly and: 1
rejoicing when they: 1
her spine before: 1
knows that nothing: 1
should be happy: 1
him whatever she: 1
at her looking: 1
you could not: 1
a while since: 1
and hot and: 1
that hermione said: 1
was all his: 1
when to stand: 1
from tracey he: 1
of britain the: 1
seen tracey except: 1
done wrong heroes: 1
and then she: 1
less certain than: 1
until she'd memorized: 1
the chaos legion: 1
another sentence after: 1
mean everyone in: 1
i hear you: 1
heroes that she: 1
gasped hannah after: 1
set the chicken: 1
you were deliberately: 1
if she was: 1
time i'm not: 1
the insane laughter: 1
you would be: 1
of smile anyway: 1
miss granger did: 1
them all okay: 1
so long as: 1
quirrell was testing: 1
possibly be -: 1
hero i certainly: 1
they'd properly gotten: 1
like a miniature: 1
with the oldie: 1
a love potion: 1
the darkness when: 1
feelings on the: 1
she could but: 1
hermione didn't even: 1
than girls the: 1
words well i: 1
gray a little: 1
been the deputy: 1
into enough trouble: 1
you don't think: 1
witch a quest: 1
from harry potter: 1
much too late: 1
men the defense: 1
hannah after his: 1
said tracey who: 1
that to your: 1
the school's authorization: 1
his eyes looking: 1
of the international: 1
thought miss granger: 1
overtone of offense: 1
her age at: 1
ignorant thus i: 1
the recently expanded: 1
a woman or: 1
beneath their half-circles: 1
say and then: 1
with the button: 1
held bolt upright: 1
girls several of: 1
subject well said: 1
clear from what: 1
the towering form: 1
like a deer: 1
high i checked: 1
to show its: 1
and hermione her: 1
speak the truth: 1
without their supervision: 1
among those three: 1
transfigured into a: 1
and tracey davis: 1
but idly tossing: 1
yet godric gryffindor's: 1
small quaver in: 1
i will be: 1
among all the: 1
you're joining our: 1
too late why: 1
people who've stopped: 1
hufflepuff is enchanting: 1
discouragement either well: 1
that should've taken: 1
or is this: 1
really set a: 1
said again yeah: 1
with becoming heroines: 1
was the correct: 1
then professor sinistra: 1
professor vector who: 1
mean professor quirrell: 1
of the endless: 1
the weather although: 1
she'd just been: 1
everyone was staring: 1
anything and i: 1
no ambition that's: 1
and also because: 1
queasy she looked: 1
and the prefects: 1
replied not really: 1
lavender and teach: 1
susan sharply you're: 1
that you seek: 1
a hero they: 1
to be heroines: 1
think of anything: 1
other people thought: 1
have often told: 1
it even when: 1
hint to all: 1
professor vector what: 1
small stone vestibule: 1
when they announced: 1
it and her: 1
world and he's: 1
of her buttons: 1
set a chicken: 1
hard-pressed to name: 1
is not six: 1
once more and: 1
appropriate degree of: 1
the girls and: 1
their signs hermione's: 1
- no said: 1
to them for: 1
of doing it: 1
now - hold: 1
much easier to: 1
was 'he said: 1
autobiography and his: 1
in a boundary: 1
it wasn't nearly: 1
think about it: 1
of them i: 1
pretty sure general: 1
world dissatisfy you: 1
said the headmaster: 1
much else remains: 1
to accomplish and: 1
worry about what: 1
becoming dark witches: 1
or quidditch players: 1
then they refused: 1
burning which meant: 1
people have come: 1
- i quite: 1
to dumbledore do: 1
a comforting pat: 1
not waver that: 1
good deal of: 1
dark wizard hunters: 1
one hand this: 1
voice her shoes: 1
uses of dragon's: 1
one to him: 1
hermione said daphne: 1
i believe that: 1
not many had: 1
flexibility to motionlessness: 1
to dumbledore hermione: 1
opportunities at best: 1
of women act: 1
was listening she'd: 1
awful intensity -: 1
looked at hermione: 1
ground and faced: 1
anything like what: 1
back into the: 1
sign - a: 1
it to face: 1
ambition professor -: 1
for professor barney: 1
down to her: 1
not truly mean: 1
is he right: 1
first year of: 1
i should also: 1
a quest miss: 1
would come down: 1
of people had: 1
in something of: 1
pretending it doesn't: 1
to slip the: 1
goodness said penelope: 1
i told you: 1
doing anything dangerous: 1
never been one: 1
brilliant hermione said: 1
you are not: 1
tracey davis cried: 1
same time you: 1
my good heroines: 1
or form but: 1
do this day: 1
right tracey said: 1
davis for although: 1
all men the: 1
at all as: 1
a good deal: 1
hideous if you: 1
she still had: 1
nature miss clearwater: 1
at her with: 1
which falls into: 1
girl went on: 1
susan i -: 1
may take a: 1
of hogwarts's corridors: 1
everyone already been: 1
unreadable eyes the: 1
older girls several: 1
but it is: 1
the headmaster slowly: 1
hair starting to: 1
with only a: 1
spies a handsome: 1
other people do: 1
glass and said: 1
he-who-must-not-be-named were all: 1
later instead of: 1
then she'd returned: 1
on because that: 1
brown susan bones: 1
ever come close: 1
tone of undisguised: 1
plan until now: 1
not my followers: 1
making hard sharp: 1
buttons repeated the: 1
the pale blue: 1
about that sort: 1
professor sinistra was: 1
three now called: 1
had gotten one: 1
headmaster was a: 1
seemed infinitely too: 1
she was calling: 1
one single thing: 1
allowed to come: 1
granger do you: 1
do it -: 1
ancient wards and: 1
was starting to: 1
without thinking my: 1
is something you: 1
was striding with: 1
careful questions from: 1
boy prefects that's: 1
hogwarts library and: 1
her to take: 1
that differs from: 1
said susan i: 1
to do with: 1
anything dangerous there: 1
learning from harry: 1
even think that's: 1
perhaps not the: 1
didn't know about: 1
teach it to: 1
and i suspect: 1
gap closed there: 1
actually true i: 1
soon - stop: 1
defense professor we've: 1
his silver beard: 1
third-floor forbidden corridor: 1
greatness that you: 1
that - i: 1
in gryffindor's been: 1
any opportunity for: 1
mean it has: 1
slytherin girl was: 1
in a strangled: 1
it hermione had: 1
everything might be: 1
and i suppose: 1
to be good: 1
that sort of: 1
stop that hermione: 1
gotten one of: 1
at professor sinistra: 1
on behind the: 1
made sure of: 1
said susan that: 1
force it to: 1
is too much: 1
several of whom: 1
to face them: 1
and gave it: 1
had gone on: 1
just tries to: 1
was a thoughtful: 1
her name was: 1
because that was: 1
been allowed to: 1
apologies then professor: 1
the headmaster any: 1
old wizard said: 1
when they're scared: 1
granger something drives: 1
a homework essay: 1
hands toyed absently: 1
discrimination right i: 1
she'd never thought: 1
dark lords -: 1
i expect that: 1
- thirty seconds: 1
professor flitwick's shoulder: 1
i mean not: 1
thing in the: 1
lives wouldn't be: 1
said well my: 1
instead of right: 1
list miss granger: 1
by themselves and: 1
problem so far: 1
sign a little: 1
all and that: 1
drew forth a: 1
is that we'll: 1
and the voices: 1
it takes and: 1
said hello miss: 1
been a lot: 1
going to faint: 1
and now she: 1
the far stone: 1
quirrell hello headmaster: 1
just silly girls: 1
who was realizing: 1
davis and i: 1
signs hermione's own: 1
you would teach: 1
among the older: 1
still idly toying: 1
an ambition professor: 1
i thought i: 1
professor quirrell was: 1
it on albus's: 1
him not holding: 1
and professor mcgonagall: 1
blue eyes staring: 1
how anyone could: 1
sold one to: 1
see said tracey: 1
you check miss: 1
tomorrow but i: 1
oliver beatson all: 1
this all merely: 1
her fewer in: 1
the headmaster leaned: 1
couple of minutes: 1
signs for a: 1
so on um: 1
there wasn't a: 1
it would be: 1
you can see: 1
former positions only: 1
everyone knows that: 1
said that i: 1
button so that: 1
would've been too: 1
do too have: 1
old wizard harry: 1
cut off and: 1
a few dozen: 1
the way she'd: 1
she knew what: 1
to the defense: 1
authors had been: 1
darting to tracey: 1
her face everyone: 1
fresh and hot: 1
sickles the defense: 1
not the highest: 1
watching with unreadable: 1
professor sinistra had: 1
demarcated the vestibule: 1
preece in a: 1
your opportunities at: 1
hermione knew least: 1
as she strode: 1
became headmaster forty: 1
inches on how: 1
hadn't ever come: 1
all hope seems: 1
second best it's: 1
potter but -: 1
there is no: 1
albus that miss: 1
picket line my: 1
the point is: 1
themselves instead she'd: 1
more and before: 1
thinking about it: 1
born not taught: 1
although personally i: 1
he has done: 1
not many but: 1
we've ever had: 1
for my nerves: 1
wall you were: 1
hard life sometimes: 1
nearly as scary: 1
i do too: 1
abstracted beneath the: 1
his half-glasses eyes: 1
had seemed infinitely: 1
life sometimes lonely: 1
a dilemma albus: 1
students on when: 1
away without another: 1
walked away without: 1
hermione blinked again: 1
won't settle for: 1
to take from: 1
others saw her: 1
opposite in fact: 1
how much heroism: 1
padma patil parvati: 1
at professor mcgonagall: 1
spine before she: 1
adored alone and: 1
over really said: 1
lonely often short: 1
wearing robes of: 1
godric gryffindor's autobiography: 1
witches but not: 1
but neither would: 1
up you may: 1
certain than before: 1
and they don't: 1
she'd never sold: 1
gryffindor's been through: 1
you seek does: 1
was perfectly still: 1
vestibule and hermione: 1
looking down on: 1
to your list: 1
a pebble or: 1
down her spine: 1
some aspect of: 1
desk and gave: 1
to lavender once: 1
mean think about: 1
hermione who was: 1
two sorceresses bellatrix: 1
than the books: 1
to the gargoyles: 1
you were a: 1
of magic or: 1
such things hermione: 1
button um hermione: 1
snorted i guess: 1
pale blue eyes: 1
suspected death eaters: 1
then turned the: 1
than she'd imagined: 1
slowly turned his: 1
heroes in their: 1
in my case: 1
since i received: 1
- and also: 1
personally i don't: 1
of the recently: 1
as heroes are: 1
weather although personally: 1
the arithmancy professor: 1
about rivaling harry: 1
at around seventy: 1
cause miss granger: 1
was going on: 1
professor mcgonagall coughed: 1
of a misunderstanding: 1
still defying authority: 1
at susan i: 1
and oliver beatson: 1
it maybe if: 1
that would've been: 1
world many have: 1
the headmaster of: 1
sentence to say: 1
wasn't the point: 1
sense that way: 1
as he replied: 1
the small stone: 1
still a chill: 1
her head of: 1
spun the button: 1
suppose that wizards: 1
idly spun the: 1
sinistra and professor: 1
told you that: 1
talking to professor: 1
had looked up: 1
be frightened -: 1
only there were: 1
hermione was starting: 1
through ice dementors: 1
knowing why she: 1
parvati the gryffindor: 1
arithmancy professor had: 1
her like a: 1
miniature female snape: 1
her muggle family: 1
down on the: 1
yes in a: 1
said harry potter: 1
letter i can't: 1
slightest but it: 1
don't just do: 1
if this is: 1
heroes are only: 1
more like her: 1
meant to be: 1
potter's mysterious old: 1
and i daresay: 1
because you're worried: 1
anyway she couldn't: 1
existences when grindelwald: 1
and other such: 1
get into enough: 1
getting good marks: 1
rediscoverer of the: 1
overtly evil defense: 1
our own first: 1
declared herself a: 1
wards and so: 1
the side of: 1
reasons like that: 1
was still idly: 1
only one kind: 1
mcgonagall had said: 1
that said harry: 1
actually qualify which: 1
the headmaster straightened: 1
even when they're: 1
except at wandpoint: 1
she heard some: 1
brown and daphne: 1
wandpoint during a: 1
thirty seconds later: 1
dark and her: 1
it had belonged: 1
one kind of: 1
perfectly still a: 1
face was very: 1
a thoughtful expression: 1
thought of that: 1
bright purple that: 1
time hermione put: 1
out even why: 1
was definitely evil: 1
the world dissatisfy: 1
said tracey indignantly: 1
still gazing at: 1
professor mcgonagall sharply: 1
really know that: 1
prefects percy weasley: 1
mean if he: 1
had been actual: 1
an instant her: 1
small nod that: 1
had continued protesting: 1
the headmasters before: 1
bit indignant and: 1
be heroes you: 1
discussing the weather: 1
paused for an: 1
and there's been: 1
a miniature female: 1
did and she: 1
i wanted to: 1
up a bit: 1
briskly our eight: 1
her hermione jean: 1
scrutinizing the whole: 1
don't - there: 1
it's okay if: 1
with one hand: 1
people exclaiming things: 1
albus with a: 1
caught it without: 1
w laid it: 1
will be quite: 1
all four days: 1
chaos legion were: 1
dumbledore went on: 1
legion were learning: 1
and heavier in: 1
little hermione hadn't: 1
reason more of: 1
the headmaster shrugged: 1
towering form of: 1
again as she: 1
get away with: 1
an encouraging smile: 1
she did not: 1
professor's fingers idly: 1
to your cause: 1
black and alecto: 1
in his huge: 1
quietly he did: 1
you are ambitious: 1
give no sign: 1
faded from his: 1
will walk through: 1
becoming charms mistresses: 1
couldn't read latin: 1
vector are the: 1
her sofa to: 1
perfectly serious i: 1
rather abstracted beneath: 1
hermione was used: 1
grindelwald and dumbledore: 1
been rather put: 1
all still pretending: 1
a long silence: 1
hero you couldn't: 1
picket sign a: 1
and vector are: 1
minerva finished i: 1
to discourage witches: 1
she has so: 1
who've stopped invasions: 1
now it is: 1
sign again -: 1
to recognize that: 1
the button not: 1
faced the darkness: 1
i'm not laughing: 1
vestibule to the: 1
the waking world: 1
were just silly: 1
said desperately i: 1
it happens more: 1
hardly think so: 1
it placed me: 1
sure if you: 1
ruefully she thought: 1
of hyperventilating until: 1
he had been: 1
say things that: 1
were staring at: 1
edge spun rapidly: 1
properly gotten the: 1
she'd decided to: 1
said miss preece: 1
we'll come for: 1
folk ever do: 1
defense professor still: 1
mean - i: 1
now looking thoughtful: 1
- hermione paused: 1
a good person: 1
definitely evil -: 1
tap with her: 1
should do something: 1
lavender that's a: 1
doesn't know right: 1
heroines have asked: 1
enough to miss: 1
heroes came out: 1
brian dumbledore smiling: 1
through fire and: 1
handsome muggle and: 1
they were the: 1
professor quirrell pretend: 1
and her stomach: 1
i had no: 1
recall encountering any: 1
ambition said tracey: 1
the world and: 1
on something to: 1
drives you to: 1
we're friends professor: 1
you cannot assign: 1
headmaster shrugged as: 1
no longer enough: 1
you and severus: 1
blinked again as: 1
sinistra said after: 1
dropped her sign: 1
expressions hannah had: 1
think that's a: 1
them and said: 1
who had declared: 1
faded and she: 1
so hermione looked: 1
parvati patil lavender: 1
in the stone: 1
is a homework: 1
padma a considering: 1
which seemed to: 1
the history books: 1
caught in headlights: 1
solidarity and of: 1
a muggleborn i: 1
voice you mean: 1
sidekick but the: 1
over again and: 1
how to carry: 1
direction not quite: 1
hands as the: 1
mean to discourage: 1
from further back: 1
real heroines we'll: 1
fair professor sinistra: 1
it miss granger: 1
not actually qualify: 1
voice miss granger: 1
are a bunch: 1
little larger now: 1
the highest you: 1

lavender observed reasonably: 1
caught completely flatfooted: 1
defense professors we've: 1

its silver backside: 1
of her indignation: 1
dumbledore would come: 1
at this point: 1
hear you are: 1
them making a: 1
her voice wavered: 1
quirrell said equably: 1
a cold chuckle: 1
that she'd been: 1
endless stair then: 1
think you and: 1
that while defying: 1
knew what other: 1
odd thing was: 1
going to be: 1
they think about: 1
she usually did: 1
into slytherin miss: 1
eleven students to: 1
the slightest but: 1
but it didn't: 1
it's all right: 1
at her like: 1

i quite remember: 1
it with signed: 1
and over again: 1
in the lined: 1
anything about that: 1
anywhere well spoken: 1
what hermione didn't: 1
hopeless is he: 1
not too lazy: 1
saying it afterward: 1
which made several: 1

barney which made: 1
you ask me: 1
stomach was feeling: 1
alecto carrow and: 1
was encouraging speak: 1
with his silver: 1
meant that professor: 1
what professor snape: 1
hesitated there was: 1
dangerous lavender observed: 1
ask why young: 1
protest sign as: 1
of glances exchanged: 1
silent vigil as: 1
aware that even: 1
now the defense: 1
one of the: 1
heart had gone: 1
wizard harry said: 1
davis speaking up: 1
reaction of someone: 1

for a time: 1
looking ready to: 1
hannah said again: 1
you were too: 1

dumbledore caught completely: 1
of course the: 1
susan right said: 1
at supreme mugwumps: 1

the first year: 1
that professor sinistra: 1
centuries earlier -: 1
voice said rapidly: 1
their number hermione: 1
- parvati said: 1
best grades in: 1
do something heroic: 1
wizards both those: 1
of a dilemma: 1
unfair to dumbledore: 1
of hogwarts in: 1
charm to make: 1
of dragon's blood: 1
that everyone was: 1
it against us: 1
what if that's: 1
face was perfectly: 1
great ambition that: 1
buttons and the: 1
that's true we: 1
still rest assured: 1
flitwick that harry: 1
on gazing at: 1
supposed to be: 1
while defying authority: 1
it without thinking: 1
stood their ground: 1
it had slipped: 1
boys chuckled as: 1
sure general chaos: 1
that harry gave: 1
leaned down until: 1
to think of: 1
out their breath: 1
him and he: 1
professor sinistra said: 1
were being unfair: 1
the dark wizards: 1
robes than hermione: 1
muggleborn i believe: 1
hefted her picket: 1
away from one: 1
she fell over: 1
said the small: 1
called heroes and: 1
like lupe cazaril: 1
a good guy: 1
that's brilliant hermione: 1
not enough girls: 1
best you will: 1
indignation had been: 1
her stomach was: 1
oh now i: 1
and then there: 1
down and they'd: 1
he set the: 1
a sudden hush: 1
heroines we'll come: 1
with an awful: 1
speaking to you: 1
her dumbledore went: 1
mcgonagall and saw: 1
that even if: 1
graduate hogwarts who: 1
for two sickles: 1
that we'll lose: 1
your way upward: 1
alone and utterly: 1
girl quite the: 1
you became headmaster: 1
good no it's: 1
upward into minister: 1
her face i: 1
gazing directly at: 1
another word i: 1
headmaster forty years: 1
hannah the eight: 1
small silver disc: 1
me it seems: 1
hermione had talked: 1
changing its outward: 1
they're not my: 1
when it comes: 1
to carry it: 1
direction of professor: 1
then i think: 1
what's right and: 1
minerva she took: 1
said susan sharply: 1
the whole affair: 1
cazaril and so: 1
the button to: 1
at everyone and: 1
be fair professor: 1
of hermione granger: 1
when all hope: 1
professor barney which: 1
granger it might: 1
witches or mostly: 1
that it had: 1
just a few: 1
trodding on the: 1
heroines it has: 1
a handsome muggle: 1
sinistra her hair: 1
by godric gryffindor: 1
that you will: 1
done with her: 1
chicken he what: 1
it i don't: 1
to miss the: 1
those were boys: 1
heroing many boys: 1
of interest among: 1
things that should've: 1
not bothering to: 1
to all the: 1
don't think we: 1
rapidly around almost: 1
the headmaster was: 1
would treat us: 1
mean what if: 1
the endless stair: 1
dumbledore's third-floor forbidden: 1
no now it: 1
was a phoenix: 1
was shaking his: 1
how to do: 1
this whole idea: 1
just talks like: 1
until the arithmancy: 1
half-circles of glass: 1
and paused struggling: 1
it to be: 1
professor quirrell's face: 1
i didn't even: 1
said and paused: 1
be they will: 1
i didn't know: 1
and watching with: 1
anything interesting with: 1
spun rapidly around: 1
hermione paused for: 1
susan bones hannah: 1
to be brave: 1
a bit queasy: 1
she'd been facing: 1
you i will: 1
godric gryffindor that: 1
that probably only: 1
pebble or something: 1
shorter than his: 1
couldn't do hermione: 1
heroism had gone: 1
office stepped back: 1
on professor flitwick's: 1
then enclosed in: 1
say you may: 1
girls only at: 1
chuckle i suspect: 1
suspect it happens: 1
had gone out: 1
is selling them: 1
is this all: 1
you implying the: 1
her finger and: 1
the world hey: 1
been one for: 1
miss granger's accusations: 1
that but it: 1
been silly the: 1
and professor quirrell: 1
sounds on the: 1
think it can: 1
very very aware: 1
is futile to: 1
glances exchanged between: 1
there were a: 1
and susan right: 1
he couldn't possibly: 1
game to you: 1
tracey he was: 1
sardonic laugh from: 1
none of the: 1
granger general of: 1
when she'd started: 1
we'll lose a: 1
his back against: 1
become real heroines: 1
professor sinistra snapped: 1
never do anything: 1
that the defense: 1
they are similar: 1
before she looked: 1
around for professor: 1
bit young to: 1
and by him: 1
what but still: 1
something drives you: 1
turned to the: 1
to teach them: 1
buttons to show: 1
says about him: 1
all i'm not: 1
has everyone already: 1
us said penelope: 1
bring herself to: 1
of them some: 1
to learn to: 1
if he is: 1
to confirm that: 1
that nothing really: 1
chicken and then: 1
stone wall and: 1
office so although: 1
bit of silence: 1
the books hermione: 1
said slowly his: 1
giggled which hermione: 1
it might be: 1
she pleases -: 1
think you can: 1
name was shorter: 1
you cannot rehearse: 1
so she said: 1
people who've overthrown: 1
that fawkes was: 1
her hands as: 1
through the hallway: 1
wizards don't -: 1
face us -: 1
the witches among: 1
pairs of feet: 1
what exactly did: 1
that it wasn't: 1
granger i have: 1
professor mcgonagall said: 1
a very few: 1
she made sure: 1
founding members of: 1
beneath the half-moon: 1
of whom had: 1

were boys cimorene: 1
none to refuse: 1
a chicken and: 1
guessed her age: 1
men would treat: 1
and he was: 1
got to learn: 1
carry it everywhere: 1
and thinks how: 1
to ask if: 1

what but i: 1
entrance to your: 1
she could hear: 1
she looked in: 1
gargoyles with their: 1
and not discouragement: 1
least hermione had: 1
latin yet godric: 1
in 1918 and: 1
boys cimorene linderwall: 1

witches and wizards: 1
like her twin: 1

why just a: 1
twelve inches on: 1
female both were: 1
did not waver: 1
at any of: 1
room between the: 1
the hallway looking: 1
its outward appearance: 1
of hogwarts were: 1
a deer caught: 1
equably as though: 1
them all wearing: 1
it seems that: 1
minutes professor mcgonagall: 1
and you will: 1
and of course: 1
- but that's: 1
voice low and: 1
the defense professor's: 1
the prefects penelope: 1
international confederation of: 1
i now know: 1
and then her: 1
of what else: 1

to increase their: 1
crisp voice professor: 1
will not make: 1
tracey was the: 1
if we didn't: 1
want you doing: 1
wizards would be: 1
they're scared -: 1
about what exactly: 1
professor quirrell when: 1
said with only: 1
the best grades: 1
headmaster doesn't think: 1
years before me: 1
conduct a protest: 1
mcgonagall was giving: 1
see how anyone: 1

his lips and: 1
don't agree with: 1
weren't wearing the: 1
susan i mean: 1
there was something: 1
wizard sighed his: 1
only a slight: 1
like a much: 1
face i mean: 1
all the non-muggleborns: 1
ravenclaw girl's face: 1
your whole society: 1
and female both: 1
gargoyles stepped aside: 1
of a good: 1
bolt upright looking: 1
deep breaths trying: 1
confirm that miss: 1
whole idea had: 1
general should not: 1
i don't see: 1
the defense professors: 1
even a little: 1
times over until: 1

and was shaking: 1
rivaling harry potter: 1
and they cleverly: 1
know about fawkes: 1

the corridor like: 1
thereby rise above: 1
again professor mcgonagall: 1
way you set: 1
solid once more: 1
to imagine while: 1

looked wry and: 1
in any way: 1
herself to say: 1
turned the button: 1

which totally would: 1
just by themselves: 1
i mean heroinic: 1
on fawkes's stand: 1
and she heard: 1
the darkness and: 1

she said it: 1
being unfair to: 1

then hermione blinked: 1
too have an: 1
she'd started to: 1
a protest outside: 1

mcgonagall had told: 1
she'd started it: 1

of eight pairs: 1
it's not discrimination: 1
voice polite and: 1
minister of magic: 1
crazy susan blurted: 1
testing hermione to: 1
prefects penelope clearwater: 1
didn't even notice: 1
preserve us said: 1
right about that: 1
letting out their: 1
is human nature: 1
said professor vector's: 1
and she caught: 1
students to graduate: 1
hermione would have: 1
inscrutable at everyone: 1
escaped into the: 1
as scary as: 1
greengrass minerva finished: 1

but she'd never: 1
advancement which falls: 1
desk favored albus: 1

laugh from the: 1
stayed quite neutral: 1
received my hogwarts: 1

straightened from where: 1
about it he: 1
question and then: 1
directly at her: 1
way upward into: 1
witches among ministers: 1
only witch hm: 1
my goodness said: 1
to professor quirrell: 1
people had wanted: 1
sunshine regiment who: 1
inches by godric: 1

everyone was looking: 1
transfiguration professor before: 1
miss granger's buttons: 1
i mean think: 1
only a very: 1
not true said: 1
heroes you ought: 1
kind of good: 1
enclosed in a: 1
from his face: 1
of the authors: 1
he gave me: 1
sign as her: 1
dark creatures or: 1
books didn't say: 1
and the dark: 1
figure out what: 1
i wish to: 1
one last brief: 1
susan dumbledore put: 1
had said not: 1
been through it: 1
heroes no matter: 1
glance up at: 1
twiddled them making: 1
witches then it's: 1
then her head: 1
headmaster there was: 1
with her finger: 1
gotten the school's: 1
she was giving: 1
well actually in: 1
brief gap in: 1
child's game to: 1
to him and: 1
the headmaster and: 1
darkness and force: 1
but the point: 1
said after a: 1
them for two: 1
hermione turned her: 1
age at around: 1
between girls none: 1
first emerged from: 1
stern voice of: 1
afterward and when: 1
and try to: 1
their supervision but: 1
worst that can: 1
clearwater rest assured: 1
brave enough to: 1
her there wasn't: 1
smiled a bit: 1
granger said that: 1
as though discussing: 1
had been established: 1
you to break: 1
he was face-to-face: 1
and girls are: 1
from what she'd: 1
turning it over: 1
the protest over: 1
to tracey and: 1
the wall again: 1
own first meeting: 1
too lazy to: 1
a bweeble-bweeble-bweeble sound: 1
on when to: 1
said minerva she: 1
with anything and: 1
can hardly ask: 1
be first to: 1
her hogwarts robes: 1
had a bit: 1
anyway - so: 1
and turned to: 1
finished i should: 1
only i think: 1
like that would: 1
but to confirm: 1
their signs for: 1
that was all: 1
more serious i: 1
a considering look: 1
what's it mean: 1
favored albus with: 1
the fabled twelve: 1
looking more serious: 1
not trying to: 1
has to be: 1
years and years: 1
when grindelwald and: 1
albus dumbledore caught: 1
listening to dumbledore: 1
strangled voice you: 1
wizengamot the supreme: 1
and jacqueline preece: 1
lined face that: 1
their dreams dumbledore: 1
miss clearwater rest: 1
from his office: 1
what hermione blurted: 1
i don't agree: 1
they are mostly: 1
actually in my: 1
eloquent in them: 1
then there was: 1
short she couldn't: 1
wasn't a good: 1
single dark lady: 1
a little this: 1
it with one: 1
may be right: 1
rock and told: 1
comforting pat on: 1
but then she: 1
sinistra was looking: 1
susan bones lavender: 1
hero then she'd: 1
his eyes still: 1
hold on hermione: 1
there've been eleven: 1
old wizard and: 1
days later instead: 1
out in any: 1
picket line next: 1
professor his eyes: 1
said hermione her: 1
to face dumbledore: 1
general chaos wants: 1
long silence he: 1
clearwater in a: 1
for an instant: 1
headmaster slowly turned: 1
dumbledore smiling as: 1
love potion and: 1
actual heroes themselves: 1
most folk tell: 1
he said such: 1
but you see: 1
defense professor raised: 1
being a hero: 1
out in unison: 1
now how others: 1
had faded from: 1
that was what: 1
the two of: 1
grades in the: 1
thoughtful herself that's: 1
honeyed smile and: 1
hermione put up: 1
hermione knew the: 1
something and there's: 1
professor had looked: 1
rather put out: 1
may have had: 1
the adults and: 1
not heroes if: 1
prospect of doing: 1
half-smile had faded: 1
on albus's desk: 1
the entrance to: 1
their shelves because: 1
people like lupe: 1
did you tally: 1
asked - no: 1
to watch the: 1
memorized every word: 1
stoutly as she: 1
happy to be: 1
look all of: 1
announced the qualification: 1
hermione the button: 1
he tossed hermione: 1
she did and: 1
had been burning: 1
she had dramatic: 1
same time so: 1
completely flatfooted susan: 1
thinking of such: 1
deaths of friends: 1
defense professor's fingers: 1
she couldn't help: 1
eyes didn't leave: 1
and that someday: 1
well i mean: 1
family in 1918: 1
their ground and: 1
true greatness that: 1
am inscrutable at: 1
it has been: 1
and they think: 1
like she'd just: 1
either well hermione: 1
thing could potentially: 1
i mean it: 1
if you paid: 1
frightened - the: 1
- said hannah: 1
either not by: 1
with unreadable eyes: 1
echoing out before: 1
linderwall was the: 1
the slytherin had: 1
than to understand: 1
would have guessed: 1
with her best: 1
jacqueline preece who: 1
and boys chuckled: 1
great amazement the: 1
know but still: 1
and rhythmically instead: 1
or so short: 1
hero if you: 1
of hogwarts the: 1
you are driven: 1
it it had: 1
five times over: 1
15pm professor mcgonagall: 1
that she has: 1
of those were: 1
you but alas: 1
granger had said: 1

agreeing on something: 1
witches are turning: 1

lonely or so: 1
of thing could: 1
the hufflepuff girl: 1

the vanquisher of: 1
dramatic music accompanying: 1
his face most: 1

his office stepped: 1
none of whom: 1
why young witches: 1
tracey said her: 1
career paths followed: 1
that time i: 1
i believe her: 1
authority wasn't the: 1
headmaster dumbledore would: 1
glanced at professor: 1
said parvati so: 1

office i hope: 1
note albus that: 1
protest outside the: 1
was giving her: 1
anytime soon -: 1
up and tell: 1
wands and men: 1

to say it: 1
a picket line: 1
being a woman: 1
bit unsteady on: 1
had declared the: 1
professor - squeaked: 1
granger's buttons buttons: 1
at least seemed: 1
of course said: 1
she'd never really: 1
realized that it: 1
even your whole: 1
said she still: 1
it and hermione: 1

and that really: 1
away the headmaster: 1
wall and watching: 1
was staring at: 1
mcgonagall who looked: 1
be heroes no: 1
the buttons behind: 1
observed reasonably besides: 1
expanded sunshine regiment: 1
fire and swim: 1
for in that: 1
themselves and then: 1
probably only looked: 1
hermione said only: 1
honest their heart: 1
as the heroines: 1
read latin yet: 1
in a precise: 1
stone of hogwarts: 1
professor was still: 1
granger i understand: 1
percy weasley and: 1
upright looking more: 1
only two faculty: 1
to be asked: 1
went on stalking: 1
professor mcgonagall continued: 1
else remains to: 1
talk to them: 1
felt like a: 1
told me it: 1
defy the headmaster's: 1
too embarrassing but: 1
into the enchantment: 1
fingers idly spun: 1
said heroes then: 1
heroes and among: 1
brian dumbledore the: 1
had probably been: 1
lot more sense: 1
face stayed quite: 1
and for whatever: 1
folk tell themselves: 1
hope albus said: 1
voice professor quirrell's: 1
she was trying: 1
does some aspect: 1
made several people: 1
armies of inferi: 1
after a lot: 1
corridor the headmaster: 1
and said heroes: 1

my hogwarts letter: 1
couldn't help it: 1
too much easier: 1
often than any: 1
old wizard from: 1
in her hogwarts: 1
check miss granger: 1
stone not changing: 1
children present professors: 1
that's a chaos: 1
way shape or: 1
only slightly lined: 1
finished professor sinistra: 1
not changing its: 1
about him not: 1
preece who were: 1
hannah had dropped: 1
deep breath and: 1
word i thought: 1
why it is: 1
mcgonagall sharply i'm: 1
other girls only: 1
them miss davis: 1
lavender brown susan: 1
her eyes darting: 1
is getting good: 1
solid wooden handle: 1
of glass and: 1
was fawkes and: 1
never sold one: 1
still what but: 1
girls the old: 1
a good idea: 1
about fawkes harry's: 1
head to look: 1
trying to be: 1
hermione hesitated there: 1
the appropriate degree: 1
someone is meant: 1
hermione her nerves: 1
put up her: 1
but alas much: 1
greengrass and tracey: 1
away not quite: 1
and daphne greengrass: 1
just been silly: 1
have managed at: 1
said daphne in: 1
little higher and: 1
to students i: 1
had been the: 1
right what does: 1
hogwarts's corridors i: 1
it afterward and: 1
behind the picket: 1
seemingly unsupportive attitude: 1
witches the gargoyles: 1
shoulder and was: 1
if there were: 1
couple of deep: 1
um - hannah: 1
the young girl: 1
looked away not: 1
the direction of: 1
remake according to: 1
snapped and i: 1
seventh-year hufflepuff is: 1
supervision but still: 1
best it's time: 1
it was just: 1
a small startle: 1
to be afraid: 1
hush the headmaster: 1
until now um: 1
miss granger is: 1
of it and: 1
took a deep: 1
down and talk: 1
heroes their lives: 1
know of only: 1
the emotion that: 1
said susan as: 1
in your reckoning: 1
couldn't think of: 1
a moment i: 1
idly toying with: 1
of offense after: 1
that someday hermione: 1
made a lot: 1
mistresses or quidditch: 1
next to the: 1
of whom came: 1
and years of: 1
laid it on: 1
potentially lead merlin: 1
carrow and i: 1
no resistance why: 1
i may have: 1
other such ordinary: 1
with one single: 1
sound but then: 1
didn't leave hers: 1
to conduct a: 1
a great deal: 1
accusations were true: 1
slight overtone of: 1
said giving tracey: 1
if they are: 1
already get into: 1
britain the rediscoverer: 1
if to say: 1
snape does -: 1
said lavender and: 1
someone just tries: 1
mcgonagall her face: 1
thankfully professor mcgonagall: 1
up means we: 1
such numbers often: 1
far it took: 1
bearing the initials: 1
as she realized: 1
up again and: 1
bit of a: 1
he used one: 1
older than professor: 1
quidditch players or: 1
for herself hermione: 1
of peeping sound: 1
granger they do: 1
quite remember my: 1
from the direction: 1
said that it: 1
speak aloud hermione: 1
on the shoulder: 1
more compressed than: 1
by tomorrow but: 1
it's time to: 1
me that fawkes: 1
above the ordinary: 1
old wizard sighed: 1
from becoming charms: 1
the work it: 1
might make a: 1
ordinary she said: 1
twinkling cheerfully beneath: 1
the question and: 1
- i mean: 1
both professor flitwick: 1
on the subject: 1
be possible to: 1
i have one: 1
and talk to: 1
still what hermione: 1
had asked her: 1
encouraging speak the: 1
her that only: 1
hey said one: 1
you look at: 1
from the reaction: 1
for a moment: 1
briefly with dead: 1
to glance up: 1
of anything daphne: 1
who looked wry: 1
supreme mugwump of: 1
though not to: 1
have been rather: 1
her twin than: 1
invasions of dark: 1
drifted off you: 1
them professor mcgonagall: 1
professor mcgonagall her: 1
account of your: 1

hermione took a: 1
office have to: 1
penelope clearwater and: 1
but if you: 1
i can't recall: 1
your existence then: 1
than before i: 1
buttons though she'd: 1
fire - and: 1
had drifted off: 1
utterly shocked expressions: 1
had been leaning: 1
- and make: 1
said she couldn't: 1
had seemed like: 1
and professor sprout: 1
late why dumbledore: 1
mean heroinic um: 1
gone on for: 1
and make it: 1
a short sardonic: 1
not to be: 1
eyes looking rather: 1
ask if miss: 1
it's time for: 1
harry gave her: 1
us - said: 1
much better idea: 1
what heroes did: 1
also note albus: 1
hermione said sharply: 1
blown up a: 1
getting the best: 1
that hermione gave: 1
phrase was 'he: 1
or lily potter: 1
of our own: 1
penelope clearwater i: 1
me this big: 1
people do -: 1
staring at professor: 1
passed said nobody's: 1
a secret i: 1
choice but to: 1
scared - hermione: 1
her feet i: 1
not look at: 1
it didn't crack: 1
considering look on: 1
because that would've: 1
in class no: 1
the way you: 1
on and also: 1
- i believe: 1
her no resistance: 1
tears i'm -: 1
her i -: 1
very easy it: 1
wasn't wearing it: 1
fact but you: 1
until she fell: 1
short sardonic laugh: 1
hermione's own sign: 1
walked away to: 1
sinistra had been: 1
facing the prospect: 1
classes and who: 1
looking rather abstracted: 1
the obvious thing: 1
you had been: 1
she looked away: 1
the button and: 1
her and she: 1
laughing the girl: 1
show solidarity and: 1
purple that probably: 1
been eleven students: 1
six inches due: 1
outward appearance at: 1
finger and the: 1
granger is selling: 1
from professor flitwick: 1
the rediscoverer of: 1
how men would: 1
breathing slowly and: 1
was professor quirrell: 1
what does it: 1
do professor quirrell: 1
wizards themselves of: 1
of professor flitwick: 1
and severus have: 1
in his hand: 1
the hogwarts library: 1
from him whatever: 1
was face-to-face with: 1
so now it's: 1
lily potter in: 1
answer for herself: 1
tally how many: 1
against the far: 1
as he said: 1
its reflection oh: 1
pounds sterling there: 1
smile - or: 1
behind her there: 1
boy said you: 1
of that not: 1
them i hardly: 1
i not known: 1
your cause miss: 1
act although she: 1
her his wrinkle-lined: 1
flitwick and professor: 1
well said parvati: 1
futile to count: 1
us are a: 1
that not even: 1
just at witches: 1
it all four: 1
her shoulder while: 1
hadn't wanted anyone: 1
thinks how very: 1
she looked older: 1
before me for: 1
heroinic um -: 1
quite fast enough: 1
very aware that: 1
oldie but goodie: 1
gave me this: 1
about that um: 1
on fire -: 1
even if you: 1
rose brown and: 1
vision hermione saw: 1
truth i do: 1
crazy at everyone: 1
music accompanying her: 1
professor's hair was: 1
qualification of women: 1
will or is: 1
turning away from: 1
affair harry potter: 1
her sounding puzzled: 1
of tears i'm: 1
desperately i don't: 1
herself a heroine: 1
it had seemed: 1
back straight and: 1
proud at the: 1
notice your cunning: 1
minerva drew forth: 1
mr potter squeaked: 1
twin than she: 1
out what it: 1
from her sofa: 1
faint gasped hannah: 1
professor still gazing: 1
even why that's: 1
dumbledore the headmaster: 1
a time hermione: 1
afraid tracey davis: 1
think that's the: 1
the chief warlock: 1
history books and: 1
and not dumbledore: 1
the truth there: 1
compressed than the: 1
her indignation had: 1
- i'll figure: 1
a precise voice: 1
face that stopped: 1
shoes making hard: 1
darkness - and: 1
the impressionable youths: 1
magic as men: 1
benevolently at her: 1
contemplative look on: 1
and the adults: 1
was very serious: 1
watch the protest: 1
men lacked them: 1
young lady in: 1
it's just you: 1
not discouragement either: 1
squeaked professor flitwick: 1
was that it: 1
verge of tears: 1
that professor mcgonagall: 1
during a battle: 1
easier to count: 1
that's not true: 1
slight quaver in: 1
them i believe: 1
that he was: 1
inches miss granger: 1
a bunch of: 1
peeping sound but: 1
ice dementors will: 1
you if they: 1
do anything about: 1
someone like a: 1
her head to: 1
no choice but: 1
chill ran down: 1
we should do: 1
you ought to: 1
it would have: 1
unsteady on her: 1
imply that you: 1
crack i think: 1
that harry's face: 1
blinked then hermione: 1
stay silent professor: 1
aside tell me: 1
fewer come for: 1
were learning from: 1
mcgonagall's crisp voice: 1
lot of glances: 1
ordinary hermione took: 1
waver that is: 1
the qualification of: 1
professor quirrell but: 1
burning fresh and: 1
lead merlin preserve: 1
followed by similar: 1
hard sharp tacking: 1
on edge spun: 1
talks like that: 1
his huge chair: 1
idea four days: 1
to count the: 1
sound the headmaster: 1
been through dumbledore's: 1
no matter what: 1
of hogwarts classes: 1
things at around: 1
sharp tacking sounds: 1
that i am: 1
aspect of the: 1
a good sidekick: 1
while since i: 1
the stone paving: 1
do hermione hefted: 1
faculty members to: 1
later all the: 1
people like the: 1
walk through fire: 1
from the side: 1
this sort of: 1
potter's direction not: 1
include alice longbottom: 1
of worry with: 1
adults and boys: 1
and his life's: 1
wanted to watch: 1
bones hannah abbott: 1
the heroines walked: 1
male and female: 1
would not have: 1
hand on professor: 1
heard some of: 1
and a transfiguration: 1
the stone of: 1
with utterly shocked: 1
his autobiography and: 1
themselves they are: 1
that was fawkes: 1
professor flitwick that: 1
they're doing and: 1
natural for her: 1
them are born: 1
moment to think: 1
don't there was: 1
to be fair: 1
cannot assign twelve: 1
our protest because: 1
yeah said parvati: 1
so on and: 1
and tell the: 1
newly minted heroines: 1
sprout and professor: 1
worth two sickles: 1
it true greatness: 1
a much better: 1
the oldie but: 1
marks in class: 1
have no ambition: 1
whole society and: 1
all come out: 1
outside the entrance: 1
verdict and gather: 1
person deep down: 1
eyes half-lidded he: 1
he wanted to: 1
knew by now: 1
forty years ago: 1
have stood their: 1
stand up and: 1
once before but: 1
wants to take: 1
her like she'd: 1
looking more like: 1
hermione felt like: 1
do what other: 1
a good sign: 1
all wearing robes: 1
a little larger: 1
the gryffindor girl's: 1
hello headmaster dumbledore: 1
dropping her protest: 1
the deaths of: 1
around her muggle: 1
gestures thankfully professor: 1
you that i: 1
all wearing the: 1
pat on the: 1
forbidden corridor i: 1
chicken on fawkes's: 1
the wall you: 1
while he was: 1
longbottom or lily: 1
hero i don't: 1
i am inscrutable: 1
and what's it: 1
little high i: 1
and one can: 1
your list miss: 1
one who hermione: 1
back sounding extremely: 1
in that time: 1
no smoke escaped: 1
said well maybe: 1
be heroes will: 1
not discrimination right: 1
eight newly minted: 1
though she'd never: 1
who hermione knew: 1
unable to help: 1
numbers often it: 1
mcgonagall coughed warningly: 1
i see the: 1
daresay that most: 1
a transfiguration professor: 1
shocked expressions hannah: 1
even know but: 1
professor before that: 1
slytherin miss davis: 1
that stopped her: 1
of it maybe: 1
and the brief: 1
be discouraging girls: 1
doesn't happen my: 1
fawkes was a: 1
sinistra the astronomy: 1
from just saying: 1
few dozen house: 1
she caught it: 1
warningly and the: 1
hermione her voice: 1
headmaster's office have: 1
in the first: 1
not quite knowing: 1
darkness when it: 1
and then they: 1
the thirty inches: 1
you hermione said: 1
dumbledore hermione said: 1
something you prefer: 1
few centuries earlier: 1
or she was: 1
paused struggling with: 1
she couldn't think: 1
about it miss: 1
heavier in her: 1
the non-muggleborns male: 1
indeed said professor: 1
old wizard minerva: 1
behind her professor: 1
lavender snorted i: 1
professor had asked: 1
not taught and: 1
brave it's not: 1
straight and her: 1
very much expressed: 1
qualify which meant: 1
very emphatic about: 1
why she did: 1
at people like: 1
from one course: 1
account of being: 1
death eaters we: 1
two faculty members: 1
too scared to: 1
hannah which very: 1
dumbledore again took: 1
if you never: 1
to motionlessness and: 1
him he couldn't: 1
it doesn't happen: 1
girl i didn't: 1
have worked out: 1
gryffindor girl's face: 1
i believe miss: 1
that's not actually: 1
maybe a lot: 1
mother's rejoicing when: 1
don't care what: 1
asked the question: 1
a finger to: 1
w forming a: 1
her voice low: 1
lavender said now: 1
does - mr: 1
witches from becoming: 1
that most wizards: 1
hermione granger padma: 1
will not stop: 1
was still defying: 1
not have worked: 1
possible to discourage: 1
learned padma said: 1
as many woman: 1
fell over really: 1
pleasant speaking to: 1
had said that: 1
of it either: 1
patently obvious that: 1
all as it: 1
quite the opposite: 1
and the boy: 1
a heroine if: 1
1918 and that: 1
eaters we know: 1
weasley and oliver: 1
do not thereby: 1
i'm - i'll: 1
did not actually: 1
if witches had: 1
the half-smile had: 1
things hermione unable: 1
face stern why: 1
her looking perfectly: 1
very serious making: 1
rare that you: 1
giving tracey a: 1
couldn't be a: 1
as men then: 1
the ordinary hermione: 1
add that to: 1
takes and they: 1
been facing the: 1
professors sinistra and: 1
the chicken on: 1
and who had: 1
we know of: 1
to be just: 1
with her back: 1
they cleverly plan: 1
have asked permission: 1
his footsteps had: 1
by similar people: 1
- i explained: 1
ourselves hey said: 1
of history made: 1
be asked -: 1
just a sidekick': 1
on the button: 1
become a heroine: 1
lupe cazaril and: 1
nerves lavender snorted: 1
in her hands: 1
answer so she: 1
had dramatic music: 1
history made a: 1
yourself perhaps it: 1
fawkes's stand so: 1
too much for: 1
count the witches: 1
was harry potter's: 1
struggling with the: 1
patil lavender brown: 1
into a chicken: 1
i ought to: 1
know right away: 1
protest against the: 1
that no smoke: 1
potter the headmaster: 1
the headmaster daphne: 1
powerful wizard alive: 1
sign that differs: 1
they do not: 1
had dropped her: 1
to gray a: 1
daphne greengrass and: 1
they will walk: 1
even if she: 1
dark lady besides: 1
- no spat: 1
was solid once: 1
to look she: 1
voice said from: 1
and also he: 1
harry potter and: 1
a little and: 1
time you may: 1
books hermione was: 1
was pointing to: 1
right i don't: 1
miss granger the: 1
- and the: 1
magic and other: 1
of bright purple: 1
professor mcgonagall who: 1
dress the headmaster: 1
first to say: 1
that i now: 1
protest but hermione: 1
quite neutral she: 1
laughter that's right: 1
you may take: 1
a hero if: 1
but still after: 1
thus i had: 1
look at any: 1
i'm sorry professor: 1
professor raised the: 1
on his face: 1
dangerous there was: 1
sorry professor quirrell: 1
took a couple: 1
mcgonagall had been: 1
tone that squeaked: 1
seek does some: 1
why is getting: 1
i'm sure if: 1
stone thinks the: 1
other girls letting: 1
hermione couldn't have: 1
it's just too: 1
had faded and: 1
colored no now: 1
from flexibility to: 1
sinistra but you: 1
several other people: 1
do it and: 1
of silence for: 1
quite disappointed if: 1
stone walls that: 1
w faced them: 1
them some kind: 1
but i think: 1
them it is: 1
face most folk: 1
smiling as benevolently: 1
to speak aloud: 1
even notice your: 1
the proudest pureblood: 1
days ago when: 1
sinistra a cold: 1
and perhaps not: 1
looked in harry: 1
for tallying such: 1
moment to recognize: 1
kinder if witches: 1
what exactly the: 1
were agreeing on: 1
defense professor was: 1
both were staring: 1
around the same: 1
you too maybe: 1
had wands and: 1
you were muggleborn: 1
the ravenclaw girl's: 1
slytherin had jumped: 1
the buttons and: 1
gargoyles were stepping: 1
since miss granger: 1
a tone that: 1
want to protest: 1
any of the: 1
headmistress for three: 1
wizard minerva drew: 1
how to be: 1
we were just: 1
silent vigil then: 1
even after that: 1
would be fine: 1
go with the: 1
inferi anytime soon: 1
repeated the old: 1
just said anywhere: 1
over and the: 1
like that most: 1
closed there was: 1
help herself glanced: 1
face-to-face with the: 1
only that you: 1
be good no: 1
the button turning: 1
then i looked: 1
ambition that's not: 1
headmaster leaned down: 1
turned her head: 1
little and now: 1
professor mcgonagall says: 1
you won't be: 1
7 15pm professor: 1
the headmaster's verdict: 1
it but idly: 1
my apologies then: 1
signed permission she: 1
all of us: 1
their lives wouldn't: 1
vector who were: 1
account was accurate: 1
there the old: 1
you and i: 1
head boy of: 1
all merely a: 1
reluctant um well: 1
any prejudice on: 1
else to be: 1
be so lonely: 1
to become real: 1
indignant and it: 1
than witches but: 1
tracey davis said: 1
more witches to: 1
miss davis for: 1
professor quirrell leaned: 1
alice longbottom or: 1
hogwarts who became: 1
it either not: 1
true said tracey: 1
lady in her: 1
expression on his: 1
the bounds of: 1
do not care: 1
and force it: 1
head held bolt: 1
precise voice her: 1
witch hm said: 1
although you are: 1
still pretending it: 1
glasses it placed: 1
come out of: 1
headmaster and said: 1
and not just: 1
gone out of: 1
was clear from: 1
you want more: 1
deep down and: 1
look she saw: 1
degree of worry: 1
she'd been asked: 1
out of it: 1
that would already: 1
young to be: 1
fire to a: 1
rise above the: 1
and then enclosed: 1
be honest their: 1
and over then: 1
students i mean: 1
and feign the: 1
still but still: 1
it she glanced: 1
happen my apologies: 1
back to their: 1
to be her: 1
unimportance never breaking: 1
used to reading: 1
seconds passed said: 1
whatever reason more: 1
headmaster daphne said: 1
really miss davis: 1
embarrassing but a: 1
believe that nymphadora: 1
at her as: 1
they couldn't vote: 1
tracey the slytherin: 1
lords - and: 1
before i mean: 1
button to show: 1
more often than: 1
the forty years: 1
hm said the: 1
gave her as: 1
the headmaster smiled: 1
you really can't: 1
muggle and thinks: 1
is only natural: 1
quirrell's face as: 1
dumbledore said quietly: 1
of deep breaths: 1
on her feet: 1
some careful questions: 1
coughed warningly and: 1
hannah abbott daphne: 1
headmaster of hogwarts: 1
a bit ruefully: 1
and everything might: 1
own sign attached: 1
few more wizards: 1
like that said: 1
while everyone looked: 1
enchanting them for: 1
alive and he: 1
hermione said with: 1
everyone not just: 1
must remake according: 1

for a time: 2
most important question: 2
- harry's voice: 2
though it were: 2

no said the: 2
mr potter the: 2

said the man: 2
between the stars: 2
i will not: 2

the boy said: 2
as though it: 2
couldn't say it: 2
out of his: 2
the concept of: 2
even though he: 2
wizards are like: 2

like you-know-who inside: 2
he took a: 2
is that you: 2
as you appear: 2
you do not: 2
to rule over: 2
all wizards are: 2
taking tea with: 2
next dark lord: 2
whether or not: 2
mr potter you: 2
could not bring: 2
boy his voice: 2
in a deserted: 2
scrap of parchment: 2
for what they: 2
though he knew: 2
out of the: 2
i would have: 2
void between the: 2
the same color: 2
mr potter to: 2
in diagon alley: 2
and not only: 2
brain had been: 2
concept of apology: 2
his voice level: 2
ice and shadow: 1
the same word: 1
will follow and: 1
trickery he had: 1
the dementors i: 1
he sat casting: 1
to be to: 1
against a painted: 1
cell and lock: 1
to play the: 1
of the lost: 1
next day as: 1
you as well: 1
one of them: 1
the wizard let: 1
and the man: 1
must be dodged: 1
had decided for: 1
anything not even: 1
better than this: 1
that spot a: 1
is their instinct: 1
body ached and: 1
his breathing keep: 1
want them dead: 1
occur to you: 1
you had tried: 1
that the experiment: 1
to control his: 1
learned your lesson: 1
thin smile on: 1
a croak no: 1
the dark lord's: 1
you are sooner: 1
myself but i: 1
me as excessive: 1
litany of tarski: 1
effective form of: 1
those never-thawing chips: 1
of battle magic: 1
to boil his: 1
person maybe but: 1
suppose that answers: 1
the stars dangerous: 1
a step forward: 1
have solved most: 1
were becoming harder: 1
well of them: 1
a too-thin pipe: 1
be in that: 1
had been what: 1
from where he: 1
a metal door: 1
that your own: 1
something goes terribly: 1
never occurred you: 1
to inquire of: 1
why is the: 1
his voice was: 1
turning smoothly from: 1
you before you: 1
herself from destroying: 1
that i should: 1
wizard had planned: 1
shadow dark pits: 1
slowly the wizard: 1
not come the: 1

zombie personal reasons: 1
irises of their: 1
boil his blood: 1
ice or shadow: 1
politics what do: 1
at him and: 1
my own age: 1
professor laughed low: 1
then showing a: 1
and i would: 1
save himself some: 1
to a rationalist: 1
assume that if: 1
retrieve the boy: 1
longer fearful of: 1
or shadow you: 1
it mr potter: 1
dark lord's most: 1
turn or am: 1
that you do: 1
that if you: 1
of politics what: 1
which was his: 1
i suppose that: 1
you may tear: 1
out of harry's: 1
gaze reflecting more: 1
never had a: 1
that first obvious: 1
when harry potter: 1
choice in it: 1
figures facing off: 1
might hear and: 1
maybe but they: 1
makes its victims: 1
gryffindor the next: 1
like he'd only: 1
than command it: 1
sided with them: 1
my reasons why: 1
magic you violated: 1
the sense of: 1
those instructions and: 1
a good person: 1
calculated ploy on: 1
a real fight: 1
wonder if i: 1
if he-who-must-not-be-named had: 1
seemed realer now: 1
count as saying: 1
magical britain and: 1
control his breathing: 1
smile twitched on: 1
keep it steady: 1
away don't don't: 1
should pretend to: 1
to deduce the: 1
done it if: 1
soon we must: 1
to the dementors: 1
prison that democracy: 1
make it real: 1
also some part: 1
to himself perhaps: 1
learn all that: 1
remember some judge: 1
a place as: 1
considered a sign: 1
without mirth i: 1
to another from: 1
i should find: 1
tells you nothing: 1
stop herself from: 1
in the shadow: 1
you still cannot: 1

couldn't make the: 1
is without limit: 1
his black robes: 1
become an ice: 1
woman she'd had: 1
would have done: 1
the man the: 1
be entrusted with: 1
then you may: 1
to a mortal: 1
temperature falling as: 1
commonplace idiots after: 1
half-lidded his expression: 1
a pocket-watch out: 1
and of my: 1
some judge had: 1
all i thought: 1
see no harm: 1
professor's i certainly: 1
ice sculpture shrouded: 1
ally on your: 1
seems to be: 1
the wall with: 1
terribly wrong in: 1
take it away: 1
unreadable and i: 1
apology in such: 1
no decision the: 1
street and the: 1
own the sense: 1
i'm sure she: 1
this day's work: 1
intellect it also: 1
you acknowledge it: 1
to a situation: 1
done it deliberately: 1
it did not: 1
ago console yourself: 1
warm to cold: 1
did not set: 1
this obvious to: 1
now warmer she's: 1
my ambition were: 1
innocent said the: 1
day and contradict: 1
filled with hard: 1
woman's voice -: 1
wretched creatures in: 1
phoenix apparated into: 1
to grow strong: 1
it you are: 1
a hundred strangers: 1
young and to: 1
himself some clever: 1
back against a: 1
that why professor: 1
word spoken a: 1
no longer in: 1
you would have: 1
blue light i: 1
his brain had: 1
to their own: 1
was silence for: 1
planned to go: 1
indispensable tactic i: 1
and pretend to: 1
suffer for her: 1
and imagining themselves: 1
children my own: 1
potter darkness stared: 1
flew open as: 1
real fight a: 1
- professor quirrell: 1
dark lord is: 1
country in time: 1
dark lord in: 1
of darkness his: 1
what use are: 1
azkaban no matter: 1
mr potter perhaps: 1
dim blue light: 1
wishes others to: 1
further back against: 1
last and most: 1
is too rare: 1
ulterior motive for: 1
bring himself to: 1
cool eyes that: 1
a great ally: 1
i didn't mean: 1
in turn or: 1
but she was: 1
would have been: 1
of thing it: 1
he'd only closed: 1
were being murdered: 1
was no choice: 1
their next dark: 1
they shall stay: 1
without letting her: 1
sooner you could: 1
midst of darkness: 1
defense professor gave: 1
guards but everyone: 1
and walked away: 1
tactic i would: 1
mr potter people: 1
oh really truly: 1
life out of: 1
the irises of: 1
this day i: 1
day that your: 1
offended by the: 1
look on his: 1
no magic you: 1
she tells you: 1
mouth a final: 1
of gendlin or: 1
the ones he'd: 1
cut into his: 1
ides of may: 1
shall not consider: 1
defense professor laughed: 1
of diagon alley: 1
mirth i think: 1
in that light: 1
oh and are: 1
magic in a: 1
into dark pits: 1
his body ached: 1
sought to rule: 1
azkaban until after: 1
such cases is: 1
is nothing more: 1
you will rule: 1
others i suppose: 1
smile stressed out: 1
to you to: 1
you an exception: 1
think if i: 1
by the dark: 1
understood the concept: 1
all that i: 1
irises those never-thawing: 1
with danger no: 1
had not shown: 1
blurted out the: 1
and other signs: 1
scattered dirt and: 1
into his palm: 1
i cannot see: 1
to humble yourself: 1
quirrell sitting some: 1
palm if his: 1
our first day: 1
balding and another: 1
their might and: 1
to his feet: 1
with his wand: 1
real and as: 1
faded - a: 1
harry now knew: 1
move their cells: 1
would say the: 1
considerable lengths to: 1
to ask as: 1
my respect there: 1
how it continues: 1
part to make: 1
professor quirrell his: 1
sheltered childhood you: 1
to lose to: 1
follow and said: 1
around to it: 1
wizards of this: 1
to dream it: 1
then for a: 1
it ever occur: 1
tarnishing the metal: 1
reduced to similar: 1
you everything you: 1
coldly so if: 1
man the boy: 1
they're truly evil: 1
that occurs so: 1
words falling like: 1
bluff using a: 1
built azkaban no: 1
instruments the boy: 1
not the prison: 1
consciousness driving him: 1
been there by: 1
and there was: 1
sadistic as soon: 1
snow and the: 1
again try such: 1
would have built: 1
we come near: 1
branch of battle: 1
sense of doom: 1
azkaban said the: 1
this country in: 1
don't know said: 1
submit genuine emotion: 1
be villains well: 1
set in motion: 1
advantage and so: 1
power and his: 1
without a patronus: 1
might bluff using: 1
and darkness both: 1
this day that: 1
of the world: 1
choice of taking: 1
quirrell's back straightened: 1
be men care: 1
over harry slowly: 1
situation and still: 1
to their decision: 1
destruction harry's recently: 1
one day and: 1
hurt you will: 1
emptier than the: 1
as he took: 1
seems you still: 1
it also seems: 1
for me to: 1
boy trailed off: 1
question he couldn't: 1
simply give up: 1
they had confirmed: 1
would you have: 1
how can people: 1
so that she: 1
were half-lidded his: 1
have done it: 1
after fat and: 1
trouble for exactly: 1
harder to say: 1
with distasteful things: 1
no words exited: 1
obvious why am: 1
thing to do: 1
now everything was: 1
improve it somehow: 1
on the floor: 1
of azkaban to: 1
to me in: 1
to another safe: 1
the classic experiment: 1
a hundred galleons: 1
that you might: 1
understand that an: 1
should have been: 1
excessive mr potter: 1
who pledged to: 1
she's one of: 1
professor was smiling: 1
to you i: 1
had ended in: 1
of azkaban no: 1
it applies to: 1
as much time: 1
all in his: 1
was calm the: 1
ended in sufficient: 1
was innocent said: 1
wall the pale: 1
can't remember my: 1
fingers were white: 1
leaned further back: 1
never really did: 1
point of simple: 1
that be the: 1
something dear such: 1
are their next: 1
care in the: 1
boy and the: 1
to support me: 1
which all her: 1
and he was: 1
form of government: 1
spoke no word: 1
light lit the: 1
say about nearly: 1
see mr potter: 1
them whether or: 1
few moments he: 1
knowing it for: 1
did the same: 1
do not bow: 1
in the slightest: 1
glacier surfaces the: 1
harry's mouth opened: 1
cannot guess played: 1
suck all life: 1
and are you: 1
you were being: 1
as for what: 1
being murdered and: 1
opened his mouth: 1
he had hoped: 1
nothing interesting this: 1
a person whom: 1
patronus was there: 1
his frankness the: 1
say it now: 1
great ally on: 1
the last question: 1
those pale eyes: 1
quite believes that: 1
you for myself: 1
advantage lies with: 1
harm in it: 1
of strength requires: 1
that people care: 1
the event of: 1
with you walk: 1
college students who: 1
it had leaned: 1
from one facet: 1
voice saying it: 1
been too tired: 1
of them were: 1
into the edges: 1
he arrives in: 1
this if you: 1
the ides of: 1
quirrell had leaned: 1
everyone else i: 1
ancient wizard and: 1
soon as they: 1
i admit mr: 1
twelve dementors without: 1
answer if you: 1
earlier if i: 1
been the boy: 1
loyalty the most: 1
an apology in: 1
drag her into: 1
that light harry: 1
no longer veiled: 1
i admire the: 1
other signs of: 1
what to say: 1
you should have: 1
bring myself to: 1
reached down to: 1
defense professor himself: 1
to try and: 1
you taught them: 1
their outsides mr: 1
it please don't: 1
if i hadn't: 1
as soon as: 1
laughed then and: 1
- hah said: 1
it would you: 1
with the will: 1
not only in: 1
say to that: 1
expression unreadable and: 1
think it's great: 1
not led a: 1
in reply openly: 1
of her as: 1
a whim mr: 1
myself in due: 1
safe location if: 1
small shrug i: 1
with scattered dirt: 1
of commonplace idiots: 1
was there for: 1
mistakes it struck: 1
diagon alley murmured: 1
saying sorry again: 1
now if there: 1
i should apologize: 1
he couldn't remember: 1
like motionless ice: 1
tightly that the: 1
himself reduced to: 1
and she's one: 1
it - and: 1
the man i: 1
to believe what: 1
some vast abyss: 1
first day of: 1
looked at him: 1
don't - what: 1
for precisely i: 1
students who had: 1
boy said professor: 1
than this he: 1
children children she: 1
class you tried: 1
head and submit: 1
face as though: 1
eyes flew open: 1
a final time: 1
as a hundred: 1
you want them: 1
you-know-who inside are: 1
what if you: 1
this country's populace: 1
like their outsides: 1
to get us: 1
any vacuum filled: 1
defense professor was: 1
well mr potter: 1
more of it: 1
be to their: 1
awaken said the: 1
yours slowly the: 1
really don't understand: 1
down while preaching: 1
his power and: 1
professor quirrell the: 1
away without letting: 1
of parchment which: 1
of a fight: 1
of what he: 1
instruments and so: 1
still in shadow: 1
say it aloud: 1
had tried to: 1
yes something goes: 1
defense professor watched: 1
i guessed but: 1
permitted for purposes: 1
a calculated ploy: 1
you needed to: 1
a calculated false: 1
important question they: 1
the same and: 1
the places where: 1
admit mr potter: 1
and distant ceilings: 1
misjudged your intellect: 1
too slowly the: 1
moments he would: 1
criminals with weakness: 1
wand at someone: 1
in the pale: 1
or gain and: 1
were to stay: 1
was not smiling: 1
with them would: 1
them the right: 1
the reason it: 1
rationalist for all: 1
your doom which: 1
alley where scraps: 1
head a thin: 1
- what was: 1
the floor to: 1
find ambiguity a: 1
one facet to: 1
had planned to: 1
much time as: 1
closer to something: 1
and those who: 1
driving him back: 1
the emptiness of: 1
had a chance: 1
guess played also: 1
bellatrix black was: 1
there is a: 1
thing it is: 1
impossible things i: 1
amusedly but if: 1
she'd had children: 1
and the blank: 1
the politician could: 1
to them whether: 1
she wouldn't remember: 1
dark pits like: 1
it deliberately that: 1
perhaps painted concrete: 1
personal reasons said: 1
eyes were still: 1
my children's names: 1
ambiguity a great: 1
refusal like that: 1
using a killing: 1
to be villains: 1
ignorance which you: 1
i had apologized: 1
as for those: 1
themselves not to: 1
first obvious question: 1
ever occur to: 1
would rather not: 1
boy with a: 1
your time-turner soon: 1
led a vastly: 1
all dark and: 1
it and whether: 1
to darkness warm: 1
that was fearless: 1
on purpose they'd: 1
potter to your: 1
to cold a: 1
argue themselves into: 1
a brief silence: 1
way cast no: 1
late thirties and: 1
the single person: 1
the other wizards: 1
a strong leader: 1
subject danced closer: 1
decision the boy: 1
might kill us: 1
knew what it: 1
a scar upon: 1
for you to: 1
taken away from: 1
of all this: 1
him to another: 1
and most important: 1
retort that would: 1
costs you something: 1
- i can't: 1
some of the: 1
his one attempt: 1
she's having trouble: 1
us knowing it: 1
retrieve him immediately: 1
to you but: 1
encountered some completely: 1
again that cold: 1
there and not: 1
azkaban have to: 1
bring yourself to: 1
had anything to: 1
what do the: 1
lips all at: 1
same in that: 1
as they do: 1
admire the poetry: 1
is a similarity: 1
hadn't examined the: 1
couldn't remember any: 1
democracy as an: 1
have not offered: 1
the auror should: 1
last most terrible: 1
or his face: 1
and the solid: 1
dreams maybe his: 1
wizard blinked in: 1
she is young: 1
be winning their: 1
whim mr potter: 1
a pause at: 1
i feel around: 1
any faction who: 1
once offered to: 1
i can't remember: 1
of tarski or: 1
and picked up: 1
slowly the wrath: 1
as azkaban he: 1
boy's return but: 1
man i know: 1
me feel guilty: 1
had just taken: 1
little there was: 1
as well so: 1
and the reason: 1
silence the defense: 1
even cross your: 1
own pocket perhaps: 1
something huge lodged: 1
of my guesses: 1
them dryly she: 1
like that was: 1
just above the: 1
say as the: 1
one colder and: 1
into supporting you: 1
same ministers of: 1
at the key: 1
to retrieve the: 1
the next day: 1
from the defense: 1
voice of quirinus: 1
realized that the: 1
the thought of: 1
your ulterior motive: 1
light cast all: 1
of you professor: 1
of doom that: 1
another silence the: 1
all but spelled: 1
motionless ice sculptures: 1
that had remained: 1
changing from pale: 1
age in a: 1
the midst of: 1
lord in the: 1
see said professor: 1
not shown the: 1
sentences to make: 1
you violated those: 1
of parchment in: 1
out loud even: 1
his enemies suffer: 1
when you demanded: 1
even at the: 1
fact would've realized: 1
people not the: 1
through you before: 1
hourglass when in: 1
finally the defense: 1
remained after fat: 1
this - harry's: 1
care about that: 1
the prison that: 1
gendlin or sworn: 1
the stress turning: 1
long ago console: 1
of may that: 1
looking very much: 1
sign of respect: 1
but if your: 1
potter to understand: 1
reason i did: 1
how could they: 1
cold a calculated: 1
were of no: 1
was no longer: 1
too tired to: 1
dear such as: 1
not bring myself: 1
i did to: 1
gave a brief: 1
was a killer: 1
to lose you: 1
place as azkaban: 1
guesses i will: 1
high cavernous concrete: 1
with a choking: 1
for themselves as: 1
instructions in the: 1
ask the last: 1
professor himself reduced: 1
as bellatrix black's: 1
in azkaban voted: 1
first arrived in: 1
after he arrives: 1
we must go: 1
such trickery he: 1
trying to find: 1
to fool his: 1
back straightened from: 1
victim to crush: 1
him to never: 1
and harder to: 1
you will think: 1
it is a: 1
facing off across: 1
their suffering distasteful: 1
kept silent for: 1
the warehouse then: 1
i do forget: 1
deduce the answer: 1
throat like water: 1
stand by and: 1
could be seen: 1
stars dangerous as: 1
longer in azkaban: 1
conversation that easily: 1
voids floating down: 1
speckled snow and: 1
spoken to not: 1
mine for once: 1
cavernous concrete ceiling: 1
had rotated to: 1
in order to: 1
desire as for: 1
voice resumed i: 1
the first possible: 1
if she tells: 1
you-know-who would say: 1
albus dumbledore's face: 1
quirinus quirrell i: 1
not consider this: 1
chance to suffer: 1
that azkaban still: 1
how azkaban was: 1
word no in: 1
down the prison: 1
have any questions: 1
complicit in their: 1
rather not think: 1
turn myself over: 1
guilty put me: 1
a high cavernous: 1
without limit all: 1
who wore the: 1
after i thought: 1
country of magical: 1
lit the warehouse: 1
distasteful why he: 1
all the way: 1
hands were clenched: 1
he was putting: 1
while she screamed: 1
them that their: 1
and a moment: 1
to go back: 1
water forced through: 1
i really don't: 1
blue light for: 1
on his consciousness: 1
to say about: 1
innocent just mentioning: 1
cold cold laugh: 1
else perhaps painted: 1
included facing down: 1
in his throat: 1
it heard why: 1
a dusty concrete: 1
a chance to: 1
rather than the: 1
guessed but this: 1
all her choices: 1
into fists so: 1
die before she: 1
did to get: 1
could but it: 1
try and improve: 1
are the prisoners: 1
boy blurted out: 1
have seen that: 1
terrible question which: 1
azkaban no longer: 1
was the dark: 1
sport not a: 1
hurt an innocent: 1
wake harry's eyes: 1
falling as the: 1
a point of: 1
the words falling: 1
had earlier been: 1
avada kedavra it: 1
after all and: 1

brief silence during: 1
walked away without: 1
come the defense: 1
harry had rotated: 1
always like their: 1
parchment in that: 1
more curiosity than: 1
hadn't looked at: 1
me neither professor: 1
this professor quirrell: 1
of use -: 1
smoothly from one: 1
while the two: 1
up the nearest: 1
by default i: 1
are you pondering: 1
tried hard to: 1
own plans did: 1
from his fingers: 1
control time without: 1
potter no one: 1
believe i have: 1
villains well mr: 1
own mistakes it: 1
along with scattered: 1
catastrophe there was: 1
killing curse by: 1
to your first: 1
slice all the: 1
sensibilities like it: 1
wore the form: 1
was blocking there: 1
they said the: 1
have thought this: 1
as there is: 1
at last what: 1
will go to: 1
a wish that: 1
the glacier wall: 1
first possible moment: 1
color of the: 1
a show of: 1
of a calculated: 1
you-know-who inside and: 1
don't go don't: 1
that place that: 1
order azkaban torn: 1
went to considerable: 1
in such cases: 1
i have solved: 1
my choice of: 1
a scrap of: 1
about the impossible: 1
this those now: 1
once told that: 1
the nails cut: 1
that included facing: 1
may tear down: 1
an innocent just: 1
images tumbled over: 1
and turn myself: 1
colder and the: 1
forget how very: 1
in this catastrophe: 1
smile on his: 1
azkaban voted for: 1
gave you explicit: 1
the long-suppressed questions: 1
took a step: 1
potter if he-who-must-not-be-named: 1
over magical britain: 1
too never understood: 1
to drag her: 1
curious said professor: 1
when in habit: 1
in every way: 1
and to make: 1
my guesses i: 1
silence then for: 1
consider this day's: 1
tear it down: 1
near not mine: 1
laugh you see: 1
and built such: 1
yourself before my: 1
your question is: 1
the calm voice: 1
who would benefit: 1
make me feel: 1
had remained after: 1
with them or: 1
in their own: 1
not be met: 1
she'd die before: 1
terrible and forbidden: 1
have built azkaban: 1
assertion and possible: 1
you the words: 1
potter i think: 1
the one he: 1
now he was: 1
find something to: 1
robes for his: 1
of himself that: 1
the voice of: 1
you want out: 1
and carelessness is: 1
other children my: 1
puzzled look on: 1
for that wish: 1
done nothing interesting: 1
thought you had: 1
guards only now: 1
possible moment after: 1
it along with: 1
safety rules are: 1
into a proper: 1
myself over to: 1
go don't take: 1
blank brick building-sides: 1
in time there: 1
sky another chuckle: 1
to submit to: 1
whether you should: 1
wrath something terrible: 1
harry's recently cohered: 1
was already reaching: 1
they'd made it: 1
realer now warmer: 1
fondly of commonplace: 1
apology even cross: 1
dementors i admit: 1
degree to which: 1
his eyes changing: 1
turn into a: 1
a zombie personal: 1
diagon alley where: 1
violated those instructions: 1
for my reasons: 1
level just what: 1
sign of slytherin: 1
granger would never: 1
me if my: 1
part in this: 1
then the boy: 1
the rest it: 1
also seems to: 1
me one is: 1
demanded it would: 1
cost of her: 1
i shall not: 1
hold until the: 1
some distance away: 1
that you yourself: 1
fragments again the: 1
will be settled: 1
already reaching within: 1
now it is: 1
reflecting more curiosity: 1
which you permitted: 1
those who do: 1
exactly the same: 1
painted concrete hard: 1
i see little: 1
mind that wore: 1
didn't mean it: 1
professor i believe: 1
for britain to: 1
is it just: 1
find a person: 1
do that why: 1
hundred galleons from: 1
the monochromatic light: 1
a time by: 1
tried to convince: 1
i could but: 1
professor quirrell how: 1
curiosity than command: 1
a faint smile: 1
very much the: 1
reduced to a: 1
already vastly obvious: 1
shouldn't that be: 1
just what do: 1
to meet the: 1
with criminals with: 1
professor quirrell at: 1
who openly sided: 1
it had laid: 1
something all dark: 1
that was harry: 1
appearing in every: 1
dust on the: 1
darkness where his: 1
i wished to: 1
professor both seemed: 1
demonstrate their might: 1
coming forth from: 1
nightmare twelve terrible: 1
professor quirrell i: 1
themselves expect to: 1
seen this day: 1
appear to be: 1
eyes had not: 1
both seemed like: 1
last question the: 1
question they hadn't: 1
would slice all: 1
yet say all: 1
but not my: 1
truly said the: 1
muscle faded -: 1
potter that i: 1
was supposed to: 1
waste how altruistic: 1
with a scar: 1
who sought to: 1
lie mr potter: 1
was another silence: 1
in it only: 1
can people just: 1
he would order: 1
no i didn't: 1
did make azkaban: 1
in surprise there: 1
start of his: 1
he was trying: 1
place that wasn't: 1
they will go: 1
curse by default: 1
at this then: 1
to stay down: 1
touched it with: 1
that was forbidden: 1
sometimes turn into: 1
amused laugh you: 1
that then the: 1
harry said coldly: 1
against the glacier: 1
and maybe if: 1
down stay out: 1
but you have: 1
someone and say: 1
he couldn't say: 1
is very simple: 1
was putting on: 1
in her to: 1
- and found: 1
side-road of diagon: 1
frame the conversation: 1
emotion on his: 1
i wish for: 1
enabled to believe: 1
will say this: 1
quirrell's irises those: 1
brick building-sides that: 1
his prone body: 1
they did not: 1
beneath you after: 1
to the pavement: 1
concrete hard floor: 1
a paradox if: 1
mishap and i: 1
you had not: 1
wrong in people's: 1
pretend to lose: 1
most likely to: 1
different within than: 1
lack his power: 1
hundred strangers the: 1
concrete floor and: 1
off and then: 1
her own mistakes: 1
it or not: 1
and already balding: 1
be undone his: 1
ploy on his: 1
leader that is: 1
his face was: 1
for the rest: 1
will be enabled: 1
defense professor he: 1
exited a faint: 1
i know nothing: 1
pledged to move: 1
and muscle faded: 1
expect it to: 1
- a paradox: 1
sculptures the irises: 1
his instruments the: 1
professor a pale: 1
to a random: 1
even death now: 1
the boy in: 1
for fear of: 1
had built that: 1
those of his: 1
a sport not: 1
i think if: 1
say between us: 1
one use of: 1
servant her loyalty: 1
earlier been unable: 1
a good girl: 1
entity who wore: 1
to make me: 1
her choices were: 1
a time as: 1
well said the: 1
this as a: 1
he was thinking: 1
where scraps of: 1
now knew a: 1
had returned to: 1
wrongly even though: 1
her out -: 1
it was the: 1
question bellatrix black: 1
not even death: 1
it seems with: 1
redound upon themselves: 1
of their eyes: 1
me imprudent said: 1
time as though: 1
- and the: 1
with weakness with: 1
and the degree: 1
all that he'd: 1
door while she: 1
only closed his: 1
sometimes i do: 1
to considerable lengths: 1
or am i: 1
easy for you: 1
me that you: 1
believe whatever seems: 1
to say between: 1
looked at it: 1
which looked remarkably: 1
so control time: 1
out the last: 1
duels said the: 1
hell said the: 1
veiled it seems: 1
trash could be: 1
how - harry's: 1
still couldn't say: 1
you tried to: 1
both hands and: 1
why am i: 1
it and she'd: 1
spot a frown: 1
monochromatic light unwavering: 1
tried to suck: 1
lesson not at: 1
gave another small: 1
was fearless and: 1
in people's heads: 1
blue light cast: 1
to think of: 1
professor i went: 1
hard concrete images: 1
road to power: 1
reason it is: 1
after they had: 1
a situation like: 1
thinking wrongly even: 1
to shatter into: 1
on it was: 1
that was hell: 1
heard that word: 1
a lie let: 1
of government but: 1
poetry of how: 1
blocking there was: 1
taught them the: 1
you professor but: 1
everything his unconscious: 1
picked up the: 1
motive for rescuing: 1
should be in: 1
boy just looked: 1
limit all the: 1
i certainly regret: 1
you have said: 1
me to submit: 1
it is my: 1
prison that was: 1
preserve your own: 1
as though we: 1
hah said the: 1
just mentioning that: 1
wizard let it: 1
it is easy: 1
i think they: 1
those who did: 1
that one moment: 1
backward four hours: 1
makes them think: 1
or not you: 1
to understand that: 1
false apology even: 1
gasp a jerking: 1
ice into dark: 1
ones he'd told: 1
smoothly if too: 1
defense professor both: 1
gloomy doesn't it: 1
but i admire: 1
and i had: 1
part i see: 1
if there is: 1
never understood the: 1
their instinct to: 1
a lie harry: 1
he would say: 1
things i did: 1
ambition were to: 1
met call it: 1
innervate or a: 1
she cannot use: 1
of neglect an: 1
my submission you: 1
it is your: 1
i believe i: 1
had not led: 1
to convince my: 1
which cannot be: 1
the prisoners of: 1
the man himself: 1
us both what: 1
was forbidden to: 1
his robes for: 1
it only a: 1
it is very: 1
azkaban still offends: 1
classic experiment on: 1
an eleven-year-old boy: 1
you find that: 1
with the emptiness: 1
been a lie: 1
some completely unfamiliar: 1
a choking gasp: 1
his throat like: 1
quirrell with no: 1
do forget how: 1
that their advantage: 1
and now everything: 1
mean it please: 1
floor and distant: 1
is uncertainty people: 1
defense professor a: 1
would order azkaban: 1
light to darkness: 1
potter people don't: 1
solved most of: 1
he came awake: 1
he who sought: 1
and then professor: 1
know mr potter: 1
or else perhaps: 1
the puzzles about: 1
with both hands: 1
for all that: 1
make a show: 1
clever retort that: 1
couldn't ask the: 1
the psychology of: 1
me to play: 1
not hogwarts for: 1
stars i wouldn't: 1
wall to memorize: 1
question the last: 1
blue light turned: 1
and took the: 1
the way cast: 1
the anger crept: 1
have built it: 1
much i will: 1
like hammerstrikes on: 1
harry's eyes flew: 1
distant people's insides: 1

away from harry: 1
the shape of: 1
tumbled over each: 1

and that you: 1
applauds for it: 1
of unforgivable curse: 1
or the litany: 1

patronus charm i: 1
this then the: 1

to the aurors: 1
scrap unfolding it: 1
how altruistic of: 1
bow your head: 1

dodged is an: 1
not you acknowledge: 1
a deserted side-road: 1
pale you couldn't: 1
get to frame: 1
it to redound: 1
as a point: 1
the impossible things: 1
you will find: 1
patronus charm -: 1
or sworn that: 1
lie instead of: 1
it is too: 1
as shattered as: 1
built and how: 1
would have thought: 1
his part to: 1
only a wish: 1
tried to kill: 1
in my mind: 1
for his instruments: 1
most terrible question: 1
of apology that: 1
a jerking start: 1

maybe his brain: 1
to be better: 1
he still couldn't: 1
boy his smile: 1
to himself had: 1
of simple fact: 1
somehow like yes: 1
same harry opened: 1
your own pocket: 1
their decision when: 1
slowly the anger: 1
and closer to: 1
time there was: 1
put me in: 1
person whom i: 1
will find ambiguity: 1
wondering mr potter: 1
don't don't don't: 1
not bow your: 1
never-thawing chips of: 1

harry said hoarsely: 1
of apology still: 1

and must be: 1
which harry tried: 1
snake form i: 1
the blank brick: 1
boy his eyes: 1
futile between us: 1
and she'd die: 1
why i told: 1
both what if: 1
in azkaban said: 1
of no account: 1
and dueling is: 1
until after they: 1
in the monochromatic: 1
my own anger: 1
your first encounter: 1
- but she: 1
for that to: 1
had apologized when: 1
that an apology: 1
wasn't a prison: 1
silence for a: 1
them dead shouldn't: 1
not be such: 1
darkness it sounded: 1
most powerful servant: 1
deserted side-road of: 1
said thank-you in: 1
quirrell how can: 1
and the slytherins: 1
only in the: 1
lose to me: 1
all the other: 1
boy at the: 1
is an indispensable: 1
potter sometimes i: 1
lengths to protect: 1
same reason i: 1
signs of neglect: 1
hell hell said: 1
them already as: 1
as though he: 1
shoved himself up: 1
of a hundred: 1
obvious question bellatrix: 1
arrival here or: 1
preaching lofty sermons: 1
it sounded almost: 1
cannot bring yourself: 1
and lock its: 1
closed his eyes: 1
suffer and if: 1
times in azkaban: 1
use the patronus: 1
great to torture: 1
there by myself: 1
the same in: 1
moment later it: 1
eyes changing from: 1
taken he touched: 1
there is nothing: 1
hogwarts and that: 1
as saying sorry: 1
a cool collected: 1
speak no more: 1
and found that: 1
the dim blue: 1
of magical britain: 1
boy's hands were: 1
quirrell's voice came: 1
strong leader that: 1
to it mr: 1
darkness his body: 1
answer is that: 1
will rule this: 1
consider that first: 1
whatever seems to: 1
humor at all: 1
now prisoner in: 1
dementors without a: 1
my turn to: 1
britain and built: 1
the truth should: 1
boy continuing as: 1
i will say: 1
out for you: 1
collected voice you: 1
ministers of magic: 1
gave you as: 1
inclined his head: 1
you might kill: 1
see through immediately: 1
just stand by: 1
tell me that: 1
have never occurred: 1
fools and think: 1
it were not: 1
said his voice: 1
the conversation that: 1
choking gasp a: 1
role of prison: 1
themselves with criminals: 1
not expect it: 1
the lost lore: 1
should find my: 1
words were becoming: 1
use - the: 1
existence the wizard: 1
and still the: 1
his lips all: 1
defense professor shrugged: 1
that to happen: 1
or a hover: 1
inscribed with the: 1
rule this country: 1
huge lodged in: 1
to which all: 1
the boy continuing: 1
never again try: 1
three hours to: 1
laugh darker than: 1
was threatening to: 1
for longer sentences: 1
what he might: 1
you harry said: 1
as any vacuum: 1
then heard that: 1
more - don't: 1
least one use: 1
criminals but that: 1
others to think: 1
wore the shape: 1
with the realities: 1
from pale ice: 1
had confirmed his: 1
someone had made: 1
color as always: 1
of them already: 1
slytherin that should: 1
if his fingers: 1
dueling is a: 1
was his own: 1
a hover charm: 1
question is why: 1
around you the: 1
occurs so to: 1
he was not: 1
similarity how -: 1
not mr potter: 1
to stop herself: 1
girl she cannot: 1
- the defense: 1
your own will: 1
moment after you: 1
a refusal like: 1
quirrell the defense: 1
it because he: 1
time - and: 1
curse which cannot: 1
well so long: 1
inside are you: 1
his forehead ice: 1
so if all: 1
really did understand: 1
hard to control: 1
professor i too: 1
in the places: 1
and nothing more: 1
to consider that: 1
should apologize for: 1
crossed albus dumbledore's: 1
something terrible beginning: 1
had kept silent: 1
take him to: 1
becoming harder and: 1
i not like: 1
support me if: 1
a prison that: 1
genuine emotion on: 1
speak yet i: 1
that long ago: 1
first encounter with: 1
over each other: 1
then said oh: 1
point your wand: 1
potter is that: 1
someone had needed: 1
sensible thing to: 1
politician could demonstrate: 1
what they inflict: 1
it earlier if: 1
may that had: 1
mr potter that: 1
shrug i shall: 1
what they wish: 1
a vastly sheltered: 1
azkaban and those: 1
his part i: 1
i retrieve him: 1
doesn't mean they're: 1
every way as: 1
steady finally the: 1
i see said: 1
no more of: 1
her to destroy: 1
self was threatening: 1
the same harry: 1
struck me as: 1
us speak no: 1
his palm if: 1
to suffer or: 1
can believe whatever: 1
to not tell: 1
a self-deception he: 1
floor and professor: 1
through a too-thin: 1
told you everything: 1

everything you needed: 1
that you-know-who would: 1

that cold cold: 1
tried an innervate: 1
not smiling and: 1
hammerstrikes on his: 1
alley he had: 1
with hard radiation: 1
is young and: 1
across from each: 1
the emptiness tried: 1
account i all: 1
casting his face: 1
shall unravel the: 1
cross your mind: 1
voice - no: 1
and rising to: 1
make the words: 1
reasons said professor: 1
question out loud: 1
convince him to: 1
have done nothing: 1
i told them: 1
come out even: 1
try such trickery: 1
still offends your: 1
time-turner soon we: 1
might not be: 1
the walls to: 1
un-vanished trash could: 1
call it a: 1
down a metal: 1
that doesn't mean: 1
no in the: 1
professor you mean: 1
would never have: 1
was smiling thinly: 1
to his voice: 1
lies with you: 1
almost as shattered: 1
not speak yet: 1

paradox if i: 1
attempt to fool: 1
wish for britain: 1
old wizard blinked: 1
like yes something: 1
their cruelty and: 1
hurting you professor: 1
doom that i: 1
doing this -: 1
outsides mr potter: 1
skin stretched just: 1
but it seems: 1
if not hogwarts: 1
as the subject: 1
of prisons the: 1
you to try: 1
wall from where: 1
rest it is: 1
them oh and: 1
seems i misjudged: 1
wizard was already: 1
facet to another: 1
from destroying dementors: 1
it away don't: 1
in his memory: 1
as i could: 1
questions the ones: 1
surrounded it along: 1
defense professor's lips: 1
lofty sermons and: 1
potter i told: 1
laughed low and: 1
back step by: 1
about nearly killing: 1
the most assured: 1
was hell hell: 1
sure she wouldn't: 1
old wizard to: 1
of un-vanished trash: 1
professor inclined his: 1
had tried an: 1
it seems i: 1
alternatively the politician: 1
don't die -: 1
dimmed and temperature: 1
uncertainty people can: 1
tarski or the: 1
narrowed and there: 1
interesting this day: 1
and think well: 1
and not with: 1
that word spoken: 1
wouldn't be able: 1
to be entrusted: 1
to mary's place: 1
regret hurting you: 1
not be undone: 1
face into shadow: 1
face was pale: 1
time without altering: 1
bellatrix there was: 1
straightened from where: 1
the cost of: 1
would be wise: 1
the other children: 1
them were alone: 1
when we come: 1
you i never: 1
good person maybe: 1
the mission i: 1
the crumpled scrap: 1
aurors losing would: 1
of azkaban safely: 1
inquire of you: 1
her as a: 1
will tell you: 1
to torture criminals: 1
themselves into supporting: 1
stared directly into: 1
could people do: 1
an effective form: 1
spoken a moment: 1
saying it to: 1
be able to: 1
no account i: 1
am i not: 1
his head a: 1
not offered me: 1
his voice what: 1
rising to his: 1
wizard to himself: 1
not set in: 1
same and the: 1
absently he reached: 1
a waste how: 1
which he had: 1
pocket perhaps rather: 1
calm voice of: 1
ask when you: 1
his consciousness driving: 1
how - how: 1
flutter from his: 1
chuckle this one: 1
after you must: 1
strangers the defense: 1
had been there: 1
pavement and picked: 1
pondering now whether: 1
mentioning that since: 1
defense professor inclined: 1
were clenched into: 1
people care about: 1
before that all: 1
long as there: 1
an exception to: 1
do the wretched: 1
depart now if: 1
that place someone: 1
suffering distasteful why: 1
less as it: 1
offered to support: 1
motion their plan: 1
mature enough to: 1
azkaban so they: 1
friend or foe: 1
that surrounded it: 1
anger in order: 1
and brought down: 1
if your question: 1
costs her little: 1
to teach you: 1
every day and: 1
britain doing this: 1
is because you: 1
he couldn't ask: 1
down twelve dementors: 1
and let this: 1
instinct to back: 1
boy leaving hogwarts: 1
respect there was: 1
but it would: 1
his own instruments: 1
to mark this: 1
altering its appearance: 1
have noticed that: 1
because he enjoyed: 1
stressed out the: 1
to protect you: 1
use of your: 1
man himself had: 1
good girl she: 1
and said the: 1
they do exist: 1
my regrets but: 1
person most likely: 1
them a politician: 1
let us speak: 1
only now he: 1
simply wishes others: 1
they were doing: 1
purpose they'd done: 1
for her own: 1
on the psychology: 1
no mr potter: 1
- don't go: 1
each other in: 1
not think about: 1
similar colors looking: 1
would say something: 1
one he had: 1
hours to when: 1
that is my: 1
wouldn't know said: 1
time as i: 1
place someone had: 1
or not mr: 1
a pale blue: 1
made it on: 1
his voice and: 1
upon his forehead: 1
it if i: 1
lore of slytherin: 1
by myself but: 1
inflict on others: 1
respect but you: 1
lie let us: 1
other wizards of: 1
you yourself have: 1
would've realized it: 1
to that i: 1
the gaze reflecting: 1
people would rather: 1
during which harry: 1
their cells closer: 1
folly costs you: 1
to have never: 1
see something all: 1
you had anything: 1
the wretched creatures: 1
his arrival here: 1
unforgivable curse safety: 1
his lips learn: 1
ever recited the: 1
built such a: 1
don't care in: 1
the two of: 1
feel around you: 1
up and turn: 1
police officer that: 1
magic who pledged: 1
defense professor some: 1
down the mission: 1
apology that ploy: 1
already watched upon: 1
the way said: 1
he'd read about: 1
not wavered from: 1
spell on you: 1
the right things: 1
harry slowly the: 1
the quiet edge: 1
do i heard: 1
a coldly amused: 1
old wizard had: 1
couldn't have seen: 1
azkaban torn down: 1
cells closer to: 1
that they will: 1
potter it has: 1
shatter into fragments: 1
stress turning smoothly: 1
i find a: 1
lips you know: 1
dementors i'm sure: 1
unconscious brain had: 1
now whether you: 1
return but now: 1
time then you: 1
kedavra it is: 1
potter if you: 1
want out of: 1
experiment on the: 1
offends your sensibilities: 1
have my regrets: 1
a position where: 1
said hoarsely in: 1
watched harry the: 1
have seen this: 1
know it and: 1
words but it: 1
lose you there: 1
were to be: 1
you professor quirrell's: 1
i am curious: 1
you once offered: 1
if you taught: 1
me in my: 1
find that azkaban: 1
seen that for: 1
submit to you: 1
his voice resumed: 1
had laid on: 1
clenched into fists: 1
reaching within his: 1
have not been: 1
and harry just: 1
would benefit from: 1
of the coldness: 1
one attempt to: 1
it continues to: 1
terrible beginning to: 1
between us it: 1
something terrible and: 1
our mutual endeavor: 1
the patronus charm: 1
to redound upon: 1
in a croak: 1
all i guessed: 1
of painted concrete: 1
completely unfamiliar situation: 1
between us in: 1
watched upon his: 1
such as a: 1
you are amusedly: 1
of before ah: 1
she hurt an: 1
things that people: 1
remember any dreams: 1
voted for the: 1
it now it: 1
within them oh: 1
you out of: 1
told that people: 1
down to the: 1
that cell and: 1
own anger in: 1
- chalk-white skin: 1
potter first arrived: 1
own age in: 1
pause at this: 1
two of them: 1
are amusedly but: 1
make azkaban and: 1
i suppose you: 1
then and not: 1
now - a: 1
door - a: 1
from her so: 1
wouldn't remember some: 1
at least one: 1
the brick street: 1
pause and then: 1
people do that: 1
mouth opened in: 1
a fight you: 1
to say it: 1
if my ambition: 1
and shadow pale: 1
their own advantage: 1
that answers -: 1
eyes appeared to: 1
she never had: 1
litany of gendlin: 1
now he realized: 1
it he couldn't: 1
road and the: 1
i thought you: 1
you see mr: 1
in it and: 1
and his frankness: 1
precipice where lurked: 1
a politician who: 1
mr potter no: 1
forward and took: 1
answers - no: 1
decision when that: 1
yet i will: 1
lord is that: 1
no word well: 1
no harm in: 1
us in time: 1
confirmed his arrival: 1
calm the quiet: 1
and then said: 1
stay my own: 1
you said before: 1
quirrell at last: 1
do not get: 1
to do i: 1
tell them that: 1
the one most: 1
the same ministers: 1
mind me neither: 1
but that doesn't: 1
you permitted for: 1
me in a: 1
reply openly icy: 1
where his black: 1
read about the: 1
into a zombie: 1
professor quirrell's voice: 1
building-sides that surrounded: 1
be wise to: 1
that my casting: 1
his expression unreadable: 1
in the midst: 1
trailed off and: 1
he began to: 1
himself up pushing: 1
understand professor quirrell: 1
on one day: 1
in the event: 1
or foe i: 1
i had been: 1
nothing more to: 1
of the way: 1
knew a self-deception: 1
to happen to: 1
the precipice where: 1
quiet edge so: 1
falling like hammerstrikes: 1
to memorize it: 1
of his prone: 1
of slytherin on: 1

slowly sat up: 1
leaning his back: 1
and then heard: 1
himself perhaps they: 1
letting her out: 1
exception to that: 1
not a branch: 1
instructions and brought: 1
yet gotten around: 1

instead he began: 1
cool collected voice: 1

quirrell i gave: 1
sounded almost as: 1
fearless and the: 1
of harry's eyes: 1
always knew what: 1
down the next: 1
vast abyss and: 1
that i ought: 1
the slightest and: 1
wish while the: 1

of your time-turner: 1
seems to me: 1
leaving hogwarts and: 1
his feet smoothly: 1
to similar colors: 1
the road and: 1
her little there: 1
for the same: 1
that he really: 1
on the defense: 1

mean the christian: 1
crept over harry: 1
i don't understand: 1
he couldn't make: 1
disaster to convince: 1
though to say: 1
that you have: 1
ordinary college students: 1
that why shouldn't: 1
believing everything it: 1
rules are for: 1
was built and: 1
loud even though: 1
what they themselves: 1

as he came: 1
gotten around to: 1
and whether or: 1
there was another: 1

the shadow and: 1
simple mr potter: 1
the boy at: 1
as an effective: 1
ached and not: 1
longer sentences to: 1
aiding them a: 1
the boy less: 1
meant i had: 1
one most important: 1
with you-know-who i: 1
darkness stared out: 1
light in her: 1
position where i: 1
submission you demanded: 1
scraps of un-vanished: 1
assigned the role: 1
made azkaban they'd: 1
memorize it -: 1
the next and: 1
you know mr: 1
suppose you were: 1
threatening to shatter: 1
shape of a: 1
him what use: 1
harry opened his: 1
their own destruction: 1
boy less gracefully: 1
place harry said: 1
your own plans: 1
they only lack: 1
built it because: 1
level that i: 1
explicit instructions in: 1
by and let: 1
correct in thinking: 1
in azkaban no: 1
but i could: 1
thing within them: 1
give a sign: 1
sermons and imagining: 1
apparated into existence: 1
anything to say: 1
i heard your: 1

day of class: 1
kindness costs her: 1
danger no longer: 1
his memory everything: 1
out - how: 1
solid gemstone that: 1
an innervate or: 1

emptiness tried to: 1
radiation no mr: 1
azkaban was built: 1
of his snake: 1
with this those: 1
mr potter is: 1
mr potter it: 1
strong so long: 1
will conflicts with: 1
it on it: 1
that woman she'd: 1
harry's eyes without: 1
painted wall the: 1
another mind that: 1
lost lore of: 1
them light dimmed: 1
think the situation: 1
light for that: 1
perhaps she simply: 1
just false as: 1
something that he: 1
coldly amused laugh: 1
us depart now: 1
professor shrugged as: 1
that the nails: 1
benefit from aiding: 1
it struck me: 1
nothing and of: 1
the same reason: 1
not quite think: 1
azkaban no said: 1
under a strong: 1
were taken away: 1
on your road: 1
themselves their cruelty: 1
it has sometimes: 1
professor quirrell had: 1
concrete ceiling and: 1
a pause and: 1
no choice in: 1
the form of: 1
his fingers absently: 1
safely after i: 1
settled between us: 1
pushing back on: 1
in motion their: 1
young you are: 1
supporting you as: 1
they know it: 1
battle magic in: 1
was the same: 1
distance away from: 1

been yours slowly: 1
could demonstrate their: 1
have been yours: 1
in a position: 1
dirt and other: 1
any dreams maybe: 1
glacier wall of: 1
have to ask: 1
professor's eyes appeared: 1
that ploy would: 1
brought down the: 1
he could not: 1
say this much: 1
and then his: 1
thought of losing: 1
hover charm that: 1
order to preserve: 1
do you sometimes: 1
fine and sharp: 1
you had suffered: 1
croak no words: 1
was trying to: 1
to ask when: 1
or not they: 1
very young you: 1
of you harry: 1
and another mind: 1
is a lie: 1
silent for fear: 1
and possible lie: 1
doom which flares: 1
were doing wrong: 1
you have seen: 1
you walk always: 1
if you have: 1
some part in: 1
his eyes jumped: 1
opened in a: 1
proper nightmare twelve: 1
go backward four: 1
you should pretend: 1
not only my: 1
i went to: 1
voice had been: 1
he realized that: 1
was my submission: 1
humorless emptier than: 1
twelve terrible voids: 1
hero who knows: 1
spot between the: 1
dead shouldn't that: 1
to say his: 1
will not yet: 1
cast all into: 1
and forbidden you: 1
their folly costs: 1
evenly there was: 1
to frame the: 1
i hadn't been: 1
people can believe: 1
faction who would: 1
power give a: 1
to them harry's: 1
there was something: 1
if too slowly: 1
the world -: 1
a faintly puzzled: 1
my classmates i: 1
them what they: 1
i shall unravel: 1
key people not: 1
just that you: 1
leaned back against: 1
was your ulterior: 1
it with a: 1
would have noticed: 1
had needed to: 1
discharge into a: 1
this much i: 1
harry tried hard: 1
heads that makes: 1
abyss and he: 1
and humorless emptier: 1
something to save: 1
then the defense: 1
floor to speckled: 1
that wish to: 1
his smile seemed: 1
thirties and already: 1
form i wish: 1
at the first: 1
use are the: 1
that should have: 1
coldness had returned: 1
it on purpose: 1
why shouldn't they: 1
all this professor: 1
of what to: 1
by the truth: 1
of ice welcome: 1
voice level just: 1
could they -: 1
nothing more slowly: 1
from anything not: 1
like the other: 1
destroy dementors i'm: 1
of slytherin that: 1
apologize for precisely: 1
for rescuing bellatrix: 1
ploy would be: 1
right things showed: 1
crumpled scrap unfolding: 1
a man in: 1
in thinking that: 1
himself had ended: 1
azkaban safely after: 1
without altering its: 1
thinking that it: 1
his unconscious brain: 1
last what do: 1
say something that: 1
up pushing back: 1
it flutter from: 1
tell you it: 1
was silence then: 1
it meant i: 1
before she hurt: 1
showed them what: 1
- no i: 1
examined the right: 1
words come out: 1
here or else: 1
location if not: 1
his robes looked: 1
you there was: 1
shown the boy's: 1
i ought to: 1
you couldn't have: 1
sufficient disaster to: 1
she simply wishes: 1
robes lay over: 1
it was inscribed: 1
sort of thing: 1
that the auror: 1
single word no: 1
breathing keep it: 1
i had tried: 1
this happen why: 1
believes that they: 1
the agonizing deaths: 1
played also some: 1
as though to: 1
i might not: 1
rob azkaban until: 1
that i feel: 1
deliberately that woman: 1
perhaps rather than: 1
die - i: 1
was coming forth: 1
and the boy: 1
evil inside and: 1
his face into: 1
are sooner you: 1
are no different: 1
light i don't: 1
suppose there is: 1
kill a police: 1
around them light: 1
its door while: 1
as for the: 1
a branch of: 1
frankness the boy's: 1
boy said evenly: 1
any more -: 1
later it was: 1
still cannot bring: 1
to preserve your: 1
that sort of: 1
what was your: 1
could not quite: 1
that i am: 1
wise to reserve: 1
to when harry: 1
much the same: 1
it steady finally: 1
into ice or: 1
awake with a: 1
gain and so: 1
been mature enough: 1
fists so tightly: 1
and if you: 1
and the defense: 1
if you find: 1
mission i made: 1
of believing everything: 1
pipe in the: 1
a woman's voice: 1
this he still: 1
occurred you should: 1
before my own: 1
to forgive such: 1
pale eyes all: 1
self-deception he had: 1
danced closer and: 1
her so that: 1
time the defense: 1
some clever retort: 1
let this happen: 1
for that light: 1
protect you and: 1
say avada kedavra: 1
from harry leaning: 1
they do not: 1
stay down stay: 1
agonizing deaths of: 1
knows but that: 1
yourself to lose: 1
enjoyed seeing his: 1
the aurors losing: 1
they wish while: 1
aloud would make: 1
fat and muscle: 1
people's insides are: 1
world - chalk-white: 1
the same handwriting: 1
him back step: 1
were still in: 1
- people had: 1
day as for: 1
britain to grow: 1
slightest and if: 1
mr potter sometimes: 1
prisoners of azkaban: 1
mark this as: 1
boy gave a: 1
he had encountered: 1
the next dark: 1
reasons why professor: 1
have to teach: 1
on his face: 1
in a cool: 1
torn down the: 1
first time their: 1
a similarity how: 1
rare that i: 1
were alone in: 1
convince my classmates: 1
in his late: 1
to find something: 1
i made no: 1
had my choice: 1
color as quirinus: 1
his blood in: 1
where i must: 1
see little hope: 1
to convince him: 1
in shadow dark: 1
to kill a: 1
to reserve at: 1
as it applies: 1
diagon alley he: 1
think they shall: 1
and his phoenix: 1
who knows but: 1
right question the: 1
the answer if: 1
to the one: 1
that people would: 1
blocked and must: 1
metal around them: 1
hard floor and: 1
out even though: 1
prisons the ordinary: 1
from each other: 1
gryffindors argue themselves: 1
stay out of: 1
the answer is: 1
up in the: 1
are not always: 1
find their suffering: 1
you-know-who they only: 1
by step over: 1
happen why is: 1
so tightly that: 1
you after all: 1
acknowledge it you: 1
mortal thing within: 1
jerking start of: 1
carelessness is without: 1
sensibilities less offended: 1
not tear it: 1
though even the: 1
so fine and: 1
voice pushed out: 1
for myself in: 1
you were to: 1
that he'd ever: 1
destroying dementors even: 1
her someone had: 1
of class you: 1
white or his: 1
not my submission: 1
get us out: 1
professor but i: 1
the last and: 1
regrets but not: 1
neither professor quirrell: 1
for exactly the: 1
lord's most powerful: 1
of quirinus quirrell: 1
he really shouldn't: 1
way as though: 1
and the old: 1
a rationalist for: 1
the dust on: 1
my patronus was: 1
it let us: 1
i suppose there: 1
really truly said: 1
fear of what: 1
its victims complicit: 1
his late thirties: 1
goes terribly wrong: 1
that wasn't a: 1
those now prisoner: 1
that would refute: 1
requires a victim: 1
once on our: 1
the pavement and: 1
turn to inquire: 1
for once harry's: 1
not like the: 1
were not already: 1
from where it: 1
eyes all the: 1
and gloomy doesn't: 1
professor gave another: 1
you appear to: 1
did there's enough: 1
of his throat: 1
distant ceilings two: 1
of an eleven-year-old: 1
other in his: 1
your intellect it: 1
this catastrophe there: 1
that count as: 1
after his arrival: 1
the nearest scrap: 1
then harry slowly: 1
concrete i was: 1
had leaned further: 1
no and nothing: 1
there is uncertainty: 1
day i wished: 1
submit to their: 1
hope for democracy: 1
in that one: 1
had hoped to: 1
hands and rising: 1
she was the: 1
and get you: 1
on the hard: 1
of them dryly: 1
he reached down: 1
silence during which: 1
am i correct: 1
to that then: 1
for you mr: 1
and say avada: 1
their eyes reduced: 1
dryly she is: 1
ceiling and a: 1
questionable assertion and: 1
between the road: 1
auror should not: 1
the coldness had: 1
exhausted to dream: 1
their advantage lies: 1
managed to mark: 1
before ah mr: 1
told himself he: 1
think less fondly: 1
in the same: 1
the boy gave: 1
my submission does: 1
amused me to: 1
one ever quite: 1
jumped to a: 1
torture criminals but: 1
professor's eyes had: 1
the boy trailed: 1
was shaking he'd: 1
i did there's: 1
conflicts with the: 1
his last question: 1
and my patronus: 1
edges of the: 1
was going to: 1
that you will: 1
nothing of use: 1
own advantage and: 1
am given to: 1
go to azkaban: 1
a patronus charm: 1
say it he: 1
as a questionable: 1
your voice saying: 1
you think that: 1
sign of gryffindor: 1
concrete images tumbled: 1
from his lips: 1
and ruining our: 1
again the words: 1
and so control: 1
eleven-year-old boy with: 1
of magic who: 1
a moment after: 1
then professor quirrell's: 1
such fools and: 1
seems with both: 1
long as they: 1
feel guilty put: 1
if instead he: 1
seemed like he'd: 1
not already vastly: 1
i never really: 1
professor the defense: 1
weakness with distasteful: 1
harry's voice stopped: 1
likely to be: 1
deserted warehouse -: 1
his eyes and: 1
nearly killing me: 1
dementors even at: 1
the single word: 1
rule over them: 1
his mouth a: 1
you to forgive: 1
they see no: 1
would make it: 1
they - people: 1
painted concrete i: 1
two figures facing: 1
potter perhaps she: 1
been unable to: 1
wall of painted: 1
not die and: 1
a hero who: 1
be blocked and: 1
defense professor shoved: 1
she screamed someone: 1
able to stop: 1
time by the: 1
but spelled it: 1
a lie mr: 1
assured she was: 1
am curious said: 1
final time -: 1
potter the answer: 1
them would associate: 1
you point your: 1
that's just false: 1
a thin smile: 1
seemed like motionless: 1
command it is: 1
quirrell laughed then: 1
say all i: 1
will not speak: 1
less fondly of: 1
hogwarts for his: 1
still less as: 1
i had several: 1
stretched just above: 1
her every day: 1
his wand and: 1
to azkaban so: 1
the words were: 1
but everyone else: 1
country are no: 1
life the boy: 1
for purposes i: 1
upon his instruments: 1
us it seems: 1
expect to suffer: 1
endeavor i am: 1
professor some of: 1
heard your voice: 1
eyes were half-lidded: 1
of a man: 1
over them you-know-who: 1
when you see: 1
is your doom: 1
day's work a: 1
professor quirrell smiled: 1
harry just looked: 1
cold laugh darker: 1
still the man: 1
stopped the defense: 1
are you an: 1
you realized you: 1
the subject danced: 1
bellatrix black's voice: 1
thinly he took: 1
closer and closer: 1
children's names any: 1
back three hours: 1
to speak to: 1
have warned me: 1
of gryffindor the: 1
azkaban he would: 1
had children children: 1
with both of: 1
you but it: 1
man in his: 1
seen lodged into: 1
ought to simply: 1
that since you: 1
it would slice: 1
that easily professor: 1
began to find: 1
tea with you-know-who: 1
imagining themselves not: 1
he-who-must-not-be-named had come: 1
robes looked at: 1
in his voice: 1
as for my: 1
to be men: 1
in a voice: 1
he had earlier: 1
pushed out of: 1
in azkaban have: 1
me and pretend: 1
professor i have: 1
murmured the old: 1
for duels said: 1
important question he: 1
had been a: 1
had encountered some: 1
if all wizards: 1
mr potter and: 1
do not think: 1
be put in: 1
it to me: 1
on hold until: 1
at it let: 1
do not expect: 1
into that cell: 1
brief grim smile: 1
found that he: 1
must submit genuine: 1
i must submit: 1
that it was: 1
the words but: 1
continuing as though: 1
i am given: 1
before you realized: 1
cast no magic: 1
himself had become: 1
expression distant people's: 1
before then harry: 1
be dodged is: 1
curse safety rules: 1
as though the: 1
putting on hold: 1
be the same: 1
longer veiled it: 1
that i find: 1
enough light in: 1
said evenly there: 1
in due time: 1
it was my: 1
his eyes had: 1
fed her every: 1
quirrell his expression: 1
professor quirrell laughed: 1
about you for: 1
a voice pushed: 1
do you think: 1
too rare that: 1
his throat how: 1
but they do: 1
wish that the: 1
a frown crossed: 1
had become an: 1
you it is: 1
only my respect: 1
think about alternatively: 1
flinching the defense: 1
not get to: 1
darker than the: 1
thank-you in turn: 1
their plan to: 1
an indispensable tactic: 1
while the gryffindors: 1
of the part: 1
us you don't: 1
blinked in surprise: 1
everything was coming: 1
edge so fine: 1
face as he: 1
a few moments: 1
warehouse - but: 1
and sharp that: 1
a curse which: 1
warmer she's having: 1
lips learn all: 1
strong under a: 1
forth from his: 1
unwavering the boy: 1
there for that: 1
his arrival and: 1
you sometimes turn: 1
like those of: 1
dark and gloomy: 1
the tone was: 1
the prison guards: 1
more slowly the: 1

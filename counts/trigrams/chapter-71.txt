a deep breath: 1
to tiled stone: 1

that we've got: 1
hermione had to: 1
harry's eyebrows drew: 1

it didn't work: 1
bullies like he: 1

told her about: 1
hufflepuff girl had: 1
her bookbag over: 1
of greengrass daphne: 1
really there was: 1
tracey's stomach and: 1
that had been: 1
privately hoping for: 1
himself with harry: 1
their wands but: 1
unfeminine said susan: 1
with us it: 1
and stood up: 1
bullies - that: 1
never have said: 1
working on her: 1
to rescue in: 1
from her desk: 1
davis tracey smiled: 1
guess what i: 1
it said something: 1
broomstick become super: 1
we're trying to: 1
and before she: 1
least now i: 1
mortar she began: 1
the lake than: 1
millicent what is: 1
lake that surrounded: 1
surprised look because: 1
led around by: 1
dropping to their: 1
muggle studies and: 1
besides said parvati: 1
draco malfoy got: 1
still holding the: 1
brown who was: 1
forgot to mention: 1
and why're you: 1
and friend his: 1
were all running: 1
it when slytherins: 1
with a smile: 1
a moment she: 1
be turning into: 1
over at where: 1
not just a: 1
actually daphne said: 1
time for the: 1
lady greengrass that: 1
this story will: 1
hey millicent daphne: 1
not that easy: 1
he said you: 1
he knows everything: 1
more girls becoming: 1
her family might: 1
but harry's face: 1
alongside her hermione: 1
really all friends: 1
same boys said: 1
that after she: 1
else it's very: 1
were a beautiful: 1
out that you: 1
and if maybe: 1
that was certain: 1
was leaning against: 1
to tracey that: 1
the month and: 1
time of whatever: 1
said rianne felthorne: 1
can you tell: 1
don't think that's: 1
was her responsibility: 1
told her off: 1
fact now that: 1
nervous voice like: 1
showing the silhouette: 1
past solemn oaken: 1
if you become: 1
slytherin's ghost had: 1
hermione shoved her: 1
bully people he: 1
at everyone looking: 1
defense professor for: 1
quiet the one: 1
slytherin after all: 1
then feminism could: 1
at her feet: 1
it's 'cause she's: 1
out for yourself: 1
then looked over: 1
a queasy feeling: 1
excuse me mr: 1
her things away: 1
said padma should: 1
was gone gregory: 1
would mean that: 1
wand just in: 1
the wand just: 1
and a hidden: 1
consist entirely of: 1
me i'm pretty: 1
they should vote: 1
got them in: 1
has to do: 1
really truly heroinic: 1
her feet wait: 1
think parvati said: 1
hannah abbott the: 1
really but the: 1
those five bullies: 1
her own part: 1
tried to organize: 1
the corridors began: 1
body around with: 1
daphne i figured: 1
entirely of homework: 1
mr goyle and: 1
right now she: 1
being in on: 1
ah while she: 1
of lavender and: 1
an inquiring look: 1
would have done: 1
don't become a: 1
in a hushed: 1
said severus snape: 1
for a bit: 1
the muggle lands: 1
smile that wasn't: 1
when they try: 1
said and left: 1
professor quirrell told: 1
everything she'd rehearsed: 1
heard about that: 1
actually so they: 1
would you mind: 1
susan and hannah: 1
him and harry: 1
of the slytherin: 1
yet but that: 1
the right time: 1
reason why you: 1
first thing hannah: 1
where he'd been: 1
answer but is: 1
and padma patil: 1
said daphne with: 1
the very first: 1
stalked off through: 1
just on the: 1
say they want: 1
the whole point: 1
and i'm a: 1
went around the: 1
shoulder then looked: 1
she said draco: 1
it belonged lavender: 1
where looking at: 1
susan said eventually: 1
the point if: 1
stun harry potter: 1
said and what: 1
i like said: 1
there when draco: 1
spent their whole: 1
a girl who: 1
stars salazar slytherin's: 1
studies and her: 1
i bet that: 1
a bit of: 1
they'd try to: 1
not we will: 1
leaning against the: 1
in malfoy's own: 1
that if one: 1
well said draco: 1
happen yet but: 1
opening gong they'd: 1
brought in a: 1
since the day: 1
things away daphne: 1
portrait and then: 1
homework when her: 1
must've had some: 1
him and successfully: 1
very quickly walked: 1
back toward her: 1
ghost we want: 1
anything to do: 1
over and she: 1
five bullies on: 1
most of all: 1
of the way: 1
like it was: 1
making occasional remarks: 1
noticed people looking: 1
the other five: 1
just to show: 1
day she'd challenged: 1
her own reflection: 1
her black-polished shoes: 1
neville longbottom actually: 1
through the corridors: 1
if this feminism: 1
ghost sending harry: 1
to tell me: 1
tense hands never: 1

of putting her: 1
daphne whispered keeping: 1
treasure in the: 1
a small bedroom: 1
out how risky: 1

2000 broomstick become: 1
eyes that seemed: 1
out loud i: 1
rianne felthorne in: 1

in the end: 1
school with a: 1
on tracey with: 1
bedroom - rose: 1
was certain and: 1
the others making: 1
davis sit down: 1
sort of girl: 1
and then moved: 1
tiptoeing along at: 1
had been sealed: 1
padma and said: 1
high-pitched eeping sound: 1
once told her: 1
to do an: 1
daphne had told: 1
if that doesn't: 1
the milky way: 1
a lovely ethereal: 1
ancient house and: 1
having her own: 1
they were all: 1
believed every word: 1
for them and: 1
it all out: 1
to come to: 1
that harry potter: 1
if i ask: 1
slightest and it: 1
responded that parvati: 1
breath her family: 1

and the others: 1
rooms were even: 1
open she closed: 1
by many dark: 1
skylights that let: 1
horror and disgust: 1
of a perfect: 1
unpleasant about it: 1
and then instead: 1
that out loud: 1
susan and i'm: 1
went down another: 1
she stepped through: 1
seemed far too: 1
ambush only in: 1
less wrong to: 1
of money for: 1
bookbag over one: 1
she was someone: 1
suggested that maybe: 1
all they've got: 1
daphne looked around: 1
said parvati sounding: 1
their appearance the: 1
a very good: 1
determination upon her: 1
so there was: 1
take down three: 1
her responsibility to: 1
up at this: 1
the edge of: 1
- you didn't: 1
she forgot everything: 1
a list and: 1
of taking a: 1
to their wands: 1
stared with a: 1
to happen yet: 1
down hurting the: 1
reminded herself again: 1
another flight of: 1
it was habit-forming: 1
whispered lavender brown: 1
that all sorts: 1
shoved her book: 1
only sane person: 1
her head and: 1
looked from witch: 1
hermione could ask: 1
woeful sigh and: 1
she wanted to: 1
bullies hermione had: 1
you get the: 1
were the only: 1
roughened stone held: 1
into a heroine: 1
nothing now or: 1

slytherin's chamber of: 1
respect if you: 1

padma patil stepped: 1
so they consulted: 1
first flush of: 1
or a phoenix: 1
loomed at her: 1
classroom the door: 1
gentle hannah the: 1
warning the author's: 1
the door again: 1
because no gryffindor: 1
maybe professor snape: 1
bring him with: 1
probably just wishful: 1
his expression flattened: 1
millicent daphne said: 1
gentle as she: 1
she didn't see: 1

meeting of the: 1
young girls but: 1
had ever seen: 1
already heard about: 1

hogwarts beating up: 1
wands as stone: 1
very first meeting: 1
contributed fan music: 1
hermione and then: 1
the bathroom and: 1
began putting away: 1

plants as she: 1
greengrass but it: 1
daphne said so: 1
back to tiled: 1
away daphne stood: 1
way of finding: 1
without finding any: 1
repeated hannah in: 1
rose from their: 1
that isn't feminine: 1
gossip so fast: 1
only in this: 1
then they should: 1
sickening lurch in: 1
i mean all: 1

awful thing to: 1
far from their: 1
to stop derrick's: 1
from his desk: 1
gregory said so: 1

compensate you for: 1
for her then: 1
coordinate see a: 1
girl flinched as: 1
me tracey hesitated: 1
girls probably wouldn't: 1
the awful words: 1
table and stood: 1

quietus said daphne: 1
since s p: 1
meant it was: 1

and flipped a: 1
told yourself you: 1
of sudden realization: 1
malfoy gregory said: 1
would be worth: 1
how to talk: 1
leading into a: 1
or they could: 1
older ravenclaw who: 1
habit-forming if you: 1
a toilet the: 1
screechy laugh fighting: 1
frescos on the: 1

that daphne was: 1
couldn't quite let: 1
i ask you: 1
a lone older: 1
see who got: 1
tragic this produced: 1
she'd rehearsed inside: 1
hoped it didn't: 1
the heroines crept: 1
even as she: 1
well anyway tracey: 1
the hogwarts wards: 1
things like this: 1
words the young: 1
over one shoulder: 1
and she didn't: 1
y'know lavender said: 1
be the best: 1
by her frantic: 1
to you nod: 1
drew in their: 1
place it was: 1
like daphne's she'd: 1
corridors began to: 1
during the ensuing: 1
argument and then: 1
you will come: 1
about he spun: 1
a different dusty: 1
knob it occurred: 1
see which is: 1
seizing opportunities then: 1
forgot everything she'd: 1
pause well said: 1
flustered that she: 1
didn't change at: 1
you don't become: 1
either said susan: 1
to do daphne's: 1
as she drew: 1
reddening and just: 1
other seven girls: 1
corridor like we're: 1
to do something: 1
old brick corridors: 1
many and when: 1
at one point: 1
her first flush: 1
got to run: 1
up across the: 1
just outside the: 1
- lavender had: 1
dismissal and everyone: 1
there's nothing unfeminine: 1
made her voice: 1
about more girls: 1

and the first-year: 1
other people that's: 1
from where he'd: 1
she'd heard rumors: 1
girl's expression puzzled: 1
she'd thought was: 1
what was necessary: 1
although considering how: 1
lower in the: 1
i might actually: 1
and try a: 1
little passages that: 1
gone ahead and: 1
shoes she likes: 1
a sigh in: 1
you didn't ask: 1
of the milky: 1

tone of sudden: 1
but the house: 1
that draco malfoy: 1
everyone stopped walking: 1

with a downcast: 1
then hannah took: 1
not to do: 1
robes fell across: 1
me mr potter: 1
slowly and carefully: 1
squeaked his dismissal: 1
this feminism business: 1
the ghost was: 1
was working diligently: 1
to all but: 1
hannah had said: 1
and go she: 1
after hermione and: 1
tracey we'll stun: 1
record at all: 1
between having your: 1

holding the wand: 1
smoothly please miss: 1

yes gregory said: 1
followed her with: 1
profile click on: 1
in my profile: 1
pause and silence: 1
moved past at: 1
snape you didn't: 1
thing father had: 1
frantic spluttering and: 1
tie him up: 1
to run right: 1
murmured from lavender's: 1
in a level: 1
miss davis said: 1
problem which made: 1
it was something: 1
she drew an: 1
see them warning: 1
to do with: 1
to which general: 1
is go to: 1
- what i'm: 1
into the corridors: 1
it to class: 1
and entered the: 1
shook her head: 1
for the promotion: 1
lavender and parvati: 1
parvati didn't understand: 1
as their charms: 1
whatever day the: 1
up and bring: 1
that - no: 1
finds slytherin's chamber: 1
played by the: 1
dungeons through earth's: 1
in a bathroom: 1

granger said millicent: 1
the ghost is: 1
after another their: 1
word and stalked: 1
ever if that: 1
a hand to: 1
pavement again and: 1
she'd noticed people: 1
in a low: 1
with lavender and: 1
mean that all: 1
knocking on draco: 1
saturday april 23rd: 1
that you get: 1
a n divia: 1
future lady greengrass: 1
it was the: 1
about anything to: 1
reddened even further: 1
said eventually i've: 1
be there when: 1
impatient just stammered: 1
putting her wand: 1
across her knees: 1
heroine just by: 1
derrick's crew she: 1
ones who could: 1
in the muggle: 1
hoped that the: 1
to consist entirely: 1
though they were: 1
ordinary mr malfoy: 1
said lavender hannah: 1
just stammered it: 1
silence in the: 1
thought about it: 1
her some kind: 1
you tell us: 1
and the ghost: 1
disaster for the: 1
all and that: 1
said lavender we've: 1
the coming disaster: 1
was necessary to: 1
the closed door: 1
looked over at: 1
odd-numbered days of: 1
comfy desk-chair and: 1
duel she'd noticed: 1
cast charm after: 1
in a lot: 1
she was going: 1
a n this: 1
own servants to: 1
story will next: 1
harry followed her: 1
and what was: 1
to a dead: 1
hannah took a: 1
a slight pause: 1
a bit impatient: 1
we want him: 1
i'm bored said: 1
a n multiple: 1
the door just: 1
arguing since s: 1
mine this made: 1
to say it: 1
to a decision: 1
girl walking alongside: 1
this although considering: 1
whether you've shared: 1
got told about: 1
doesn't think you're: 1
feminist it's pronounced: 1
said there was: 1
through the solemn: 1
what daphne said: 1
before she started: 1
anyway tracey said: 1
on being friendly: 1
it would be: 1
lavender's own left: 1
said susan as: 1
lit by a: 1
stepped through the: 1
okay if i: 1
new record for: 1
harry said quite: 1
the low menacing: 1
had put a: 1
ravenclaws began shuffling: 1
at 7pm pacific: 1
squished like bugs: 1
while seizing opportunities: 1
posted well daphne: 1
reddening even further: 1
do anything they: 1
enthusiasm wore off: 1
a lot of: 1
rose up from: 1
then he said: 1
you were waiting: 1
soon enough daphne: 1
but that just: 1
daphne just let: 1
feminism in the: 1
else how do: 1
flitwick squeaked his: 1
tracey added having: 1
breakfast every day: 1
to tell draco: 1
sound of trouble: 1
into the realms: 1
happened to be: 1
waiting just outside: 1
his book as: 1
what said daphne: 1
that was what: 1
sigh in the: 1
final inch of: 1
whisper this is: 1
slytherin's ghost helping: 1
also certain on: 1
his bed she: 1
her hand fall: 1
just being friendly: 1
also found some: 1
to anyone of: 1
you told yourself: 1
calling hannah unfeminine: 1
a smile that: 1
someone was bound: 1
to walk off: 1
anything they wanted: 1
chapter of the: 1
two-foot essay she: 1
daphne hoped so: 1
the corridor like: 1
her head darted: 1
quietus and then: 1
finding them daphne: 1
change may i: 1
the first place: 1
general granger murmured: 1
utterly empty and: 1
hogwarts passed them: 1
head sadly with: 1
lavender we've got: 1
e w did: 1
as charming as: 1
had once told: 1
what was the: 1
and stalked off: 1
hogwarts until she: 1
who was subdued: 1
got five boys: 1
differently even the: 1
beans someone was: 1
was just being: 1
and no scientist: 1
inside her head: 1
why next time: 1
again that since: 1
hannah as she: 1
morning of school: 1
father's sixth year: 1
to class just: 1
book into her: 1
probably wouldn't be: 1
all but an: 1
he stepped out: 1
others didn't vote: 1
afterward but yeah: 1
wishful thinking on: 1
twisty little passages: 1
a phoenix or: 1
isn't feminine the: 1
look older in: 1
ask of course: 1
figured out today: 1
you were a: 1
figure whizzing into: 1
on the walls: 1
was bound to: 1
been collecting ambitions: 1
said professor snape's: 1
said millicent what: 1
hannah voted no: 1
snape took out: 1
chaos has to: 1
seconds she said: 1
that's what padma: 1
said a new: 1
minutes i bet: 1
them by one: 1
people he thinks: 1
girls weren't allowed: 1
still her mother: 1
believe that's what: 1
whole lives waiting: 1
guess if i'm: 1
daphne and susan: 1
have for you: 1
parvati let her: 1
slytherin was working: 1
sure padma explained: 1
snorted scornfully you: 1
potter eat chocolate: 1
is it okay: 1
beating up first-year: 1
and no slytherin: 1
ghost wow i: 1
in her stomach: 1
30pm on saturday: 1
had to run: 1
instead of putting: 1
daphne happened to: 1
seven girls looked: 1
they were nowhere: 1
her then her: 1
below what she'd: 1
in their breath: 1
helpless young girls: 1
in an equally: 1
noticed the ravenclaw: 1
wouldn't be good: 1
plotted his way: 1
of us as: 1
after he closed: 1
a hushed whisper: 1
recently - oh: 1
general what said: 1
beautiful heroine born: 1
e w hermione: 1
meant to be: 1
something harry's eyebrows: 1
ensuing argument and: 1
greengrass that if: 1
if professor snape: 1
down there to: 1
i bet daphne's: 1
said nothing to: 1
be heroes even: 1
next update at: 1
of weariness i'm: 1
common room at: 1
harry potter would: 1
downcast expression excuse: 1
stunning harry potter: 1
of professor snape: 1
considering how fast: 1
mean i only: 1
had thought she'd: 1
place always looking: 1
and carefully through: 1
near the roof: 1
columbia university forgot: 1
with a certain: 1
could take down: 1
says he's meant: 1
in hogwarts beating: 1
like it when: 1
them could attend: 1
find bullies like: 1
was the lowest: 1
please miss davis: 1
to wonder if: 1
everyone looking at: 1
people - her: 1
the reason why: 1
it was back: 1
the forbidden things: 1
words memory-charmed and: 1
considered it carefully: 1
and tracey not: 1
something rather sad: 1
to greet her: 1
to compensate you: 1
miss hermione granger: 1
her head of: 1
that a boy: 1
silver snakes instead: 1
didn't take advantage: 1
general granger hadn't: 1
and very quickly: 1
wood and everburning: 1
step feeling like: 1
first-year girl could: 1
malfoy's - so: 1
actually happen daphne: 1
and not hermione's: 1
mor i've created: 1
of his bedroom: 1
the day she'd: 1
if it did: 1
while her cheeks: 1
would dare assault: 1
they'd made it: 1
his wand said: 1
a hero so: 1
to make them: 1
realization of course: 1
professor flitwick squeaked: 1
flipped a knut: 1
surely know said: 1
time around see: 1
at parvati let: 1
general had also: 1
and just as: 1
up from his: 1
last one i: 1
just like mother: 1
um okay susan: 1
to say they: 1
involuntary breath her: 1
was so that: 1
the thing that: 1
the nervous little: 1
at where millicent: 1
as friends whispered: 1
down a flight: 1
mouth open she: 1
said daphne at: 1
back in time: 1
harry potter anything: 1
we'd run into: 1
whether harry potter: 1
point they heard: 1
tracey was opening: 1
rate and what: 1
miss davis sit: 1
be the deciding: 1
a 0 fatality: 1
rettek has started: 1
and wandered back: 1
her and for: 1
hufflepuff y'know lavender: 1
strolled back through: 1
to britain was: 1
but an empty: 1
the forbidden third-floor: 1
chair even as: 1
eventually i've got: 1
lump father had: 1
argued that if: 1
trying to help: 1
said it's not: 1
something unpleasant about: 1
something to tell: 1
it could focus: 1
harry see space: 1
and book and: 1
- that she: 1
she nodded frightened: 1
gryffindor would ever: 1
herself down in: 1
a charming smile: 1
up hermione looked: 1
to find bullies: 1
know about things: 1
somewhere but we've: 1
genuinely didn't know: 1
they couldn't possibly: 1
started a chapter: 1
her parchment and: 1
greengrass daphne hoped: 1
godric gryffindor harry's: 1
actually happens i: 1
and after they'd: 1
to his book: 1
running around trying: 1
and everyone rose: 1
their conversation and: 1
just wishful thinking: 1
world's only magical: 1
look a bit: 1
they were the: 1
us how to: 1
in the ghost's: 1
7pm pacific time: 1
forbidden third-floor corridor: 1
of hands general: 1
get to their: 1
elegant and uncreased: 1
made it to: 1
pursue boys in: 1
other five they: 1
mean we're friends: 1
let her hand: 1
right time d'you: 1
after they'd followed: 1
that fired as: 1
any more because: 1
was no point: 1
sounded like more: 1
bad as being: 1
ensuing discussion would: 1
millicent had probably: 1
wall of his: 1
said that most: 1
doorway draco malfoy: 1
but everyone stopped: 1
through dusty old: 1
first place it: 1
about this who: 1
she could at: 1
slytherin would've put: 1
explain again while: 1
the hallways so: 1
gregory came in: 1
parents had moved: 1
work for them: 1
as low as: 1
many dark openings: 1
she's in her: 1
that she didn't: 1
a boy besides: 1
inside his own: 1
he was trying: 1
to her list: 1
began to walk: 1
openings and lit: 1
making her voice: 1
on her part: 1
they want to: 1
this matter miss: 1
your extremely generous: 1
sort of led: 1
parchment and book: 1
me said hermione: 1
would run across: 1
older bullies then: 1
only difference was: 1
tracey hesitated and: 1
statement entirely so: 1
vision and then: 1
and meant it: 1
others looked at: 1
house so there: 1
and drew in: 1
list of ambitions: 1
they could pool: 1
she would have: 1
that being the: 1
ears caught up: 1
homework and began: 1
is very simple: 1
both like the: 1
lives waiting for: 1
she'd decided that: 1
walls while tracey's: 1
waiting for an: 1
just in case: 1
to think parvati: 1
lavender said thoughtfully: 1
see much point: 1
the slytherin gave: 1
cheeks reddening even: 1
room and gazing: 1
they were both: 1
w wasn't about: 1
herself to say: 1
potter had been: 1
breakfast-time and when: 1
step up from: 1
headmaster tells you: 1
can ask of: 1
of doom can: 1
first-year girls ought: 1
it was a: 1
boy i like: 1
daphne said in: 1
bullies got really: 1
flew open behind: 1
as the eight: 1
didn't know whether: 1
approaching the girl's: 1
three dark lords: 1
wrong to see: 1
things went wrong: 1
she had to: 1
or golden frescos: 1
patil whether you've: 1
snakes instead of: 1
to see who: 1
hannah the reason: 1
sixteen minutes and: 1
the odds that: 1
keep a watchful: 1
single door pierced: 1
downward the private: 1
the end of: 1
to a brief: 1
corner and there: 1
just decided that: 1
girl nodded again: 1
i mean um: 1
dawning in her: 1
of the future: 1
down so there: 1
made a show: 1
to become friends: 1
why're you calling: 1
sniffing and dropping: 1
when draco malfoy: 1
and it wasn't: 1
so thank you: 1
edge of her: 1
course he got: 1
for witches a: 1
etherpad page so: 1
possibly let the: 1
like you isn't: 1
crude-looking mortar she: 1
whole thing you: 1
wanted which sounded: 1
no wizard and: 1
will next update: 1
herself they'd made: 1
track of how: 1
that led to: 1
the way and: 1
for the slightest: 1
closed her mouth: 1
want to ever: 1
i guess if: 1
atmosphere and the: 1
essay she was: 1
smiled and meant: 1
moved to britain: 1
minutes and thirty: 1
got told by: 1
of house strode: 1
nowhere near the: 1
side of professor: 1
explain and then: 1
gestured to his: 1
change to her: 1
already wincing to: 1
the chair as: 1
he walked on: 1
old brick corridor: 1
aside tracey added: 1
person in hogwarts: 1
made a list: 1
all sorts of: 1
at her more: 1
said hermione she: 1
stammering denials don't: 1
change - and: 1
the others didn't: 1
this case they: 1
say it and: 1
with an inquiring: 1
as tracey was: 1
- hermione harry: 1
carefully through the: 1
the door behind: 1
- so miss: 1
as his last: 1
observed thoughtfully that: 1
slight pause well: 1
and began putting: 1
you they went: 1
it's pronounced feminine: 1
he was escorting: 1
just barely before: 1
destined to marry: 1
the bones family: 1
another boys' bathroom: 1
keyed into the: 1
further then hannah: 1
off on their: 1
them strolled back: 1
them in bad: 1
of the society: 1
we'll stun harry: 1

that was good: 1
the door opened: 1
pretty hard before: 1
susan there's nothing: 1
through earth's crust: 1
me to say: 1
to the edge: 1
know whether harry: 1
stood before the: 1
gazed off into: 1
as stone and: 1
it really was: 1
had to scramble: 1
class hermione was: 1
she couldn't keep: 1
through the doorway: 1
taking her to: 1
that if they: 1
quirrell casts to: 1
off toward the: 1
here growled mr: 1
of multiplication judging: 1
hannah's cheeks were: 1
the daughter of: 1
to his servant: 1
slytherining was all: 1
at her briefly: 1
and your friends: 1
well be her: 1
course can you: 1
- well we've: 1
hero so that: 1
to mean and: 1
the maze of: 1
halted their conversation: 1
tracey halted their: 1
dare assault a: 1
so we made: 1
with the words: 1
on things like: 1
after her first: 1
daphne just shook: 1
end of breakfast-time: 1
maybe witchism could: 1
a real slytherin: 1
the bullies got: 1
let the others: 1
were looking at: 1
harry had rounded: 1
the walls -: 1
potter to stop: 1
along at her: 1
general granger had: 1
actually be turning: 1
girl's high voice: 1
want anything for: 1
led to the: 1
instead that took: 1
might like you: 1
thought was the: 1
dungeons and the: 1
over to their: 1
what said rianne: 1
even thinking rose: 1
into the utterly: 1
whose thoughts right: 1
came in shut: 1
the stone walls: 1
then turned through: 1
her part they: 1
across those five: 1
said thoughtfully i: 1
daphne had half-expected: 1
nervous little hufflepuff: 1
the stairs that: 1
memory-charmed and for: 1
surrounded the slytherin: 1
day ended and: 1
and for her: 1
bathroom and turned: 1
realms of political: 1
at them hannah's: 1
sitting in her: 1
to the girl: 1
allowed to ask: 1
multiplication judging by: 1
been anywhere but: 1
a boy will: 1
she stared down: 1
yes said lavender: 1
on the third-and-a-halfth: 1
down another flight: 1
and the interstellar: 1
done he turned: 1
so that the: 1
like more fun: 1
to tell us: 1
at where daphne: 1
didn't see much: 1
draco malfoy -: 1
daphne thought about: 1
miss patil padma: 1
off and so: 1
interesting actually happens: 1
her face excuse: 1
ears peeled for: 1
of the month: 1
the first-year ravenclaws: 1
no gryffindor would: 1
of course can: 1
that daphne thought: 1
you for help: 1
look of surprise: 1
of trouble just: 1
down to her: 1
same thing father: 1
started the whole: 1
had known that: 1
that took them: 1
i should've thought: 1
end up on: 1
were even lower: 1
on my pen: 1
private rooms were: 1
passageway around a: 1
couldn't possibly let: 1
a single door: 1
eat chocolate frogs: 1
becoming heroes hermione: 1
what did you: 1
everyone in s: 1
successful forays into: 1
own reflection in: 1
it really truly: 1
empty rock cavern: 1
heroine but father: 1
someone who mattered: 1
tell draco malfoy: 1
of them could: 1
the corner and: 1
bet you're right: 1
of malfoy was: 1
a perfect safety: 1
looking for enemy: 1
well not exactly: 1
bet that all: 1
in the imperious: 1
briefly and then: 1
to tell you: 1
after the resulting: 1
this something interesting: 1
inch of transfiguration: 1
by a single: 1
time in her: 1
like he tells: 1
was that scared: 1
looking at parvati: 1
opened again and: 1
he was waiting: 1
to let him: 1
her own homework: 1
something interesting actually: 1
with a sigh: 1
we're friends right: 1
malfoy draco said: 1
the resulting argument: 1
adventures that couldn't: 1
was a little: 1
doesn't work shouted: 1
and unfortunately for: 1
boy besides said: 1
mind following us: 1
last statement entirely: 1
hermione whose brain: 1
a strange hope: 1
time by centuries: 1
talking about godric: 1
should vote on: 1
diamond chandeliers or: 1
try something like: 1
as she carefully: 1
when slytherins bully: 1
do an audiobook: 1
before she could: 1
chair as he: 1
yourself and your: 1
lightless void between: 1
just about more: 1
that look they: 1
to do anything: 1
went off toward: 1
pierced by many: 1
for being memory-charmed: 1
witches was that: 1
daphne finished her: 1
stay with the: 1
be remembered by: 1
the class hermione: 1
a surprised look: 1
level voice unlike: 1
just like she: 1
she'd never have: 1
have paid a: 1
music a lovely: 1
bed quietus said: 1
stomach and she: 1
rehearsed inside her: 1
the whole class: 1
gryffindor come to: 1
room that was: 1
tight leash and: 1
her mother had: 1
together and not: 1
a library session: 1
the promotion of: 1
figured out that: 1
had stayed silent: 1
other daughters and: 1
happen daphne had: 1
it'd been anywhere: 1
just as hannah: 1
tells you not: 1
them just like: 1
drew his wand: 1
her mokeskin pouch: 1
was done he: 1
eyes were blazing: 1
discussion would not: 1
galleons to be: 1
slytherin common room: 1
frescos and came: 1
tried to make: 1
she drew near: 1
the boy rose: 1
had that look: 1
look at everyone: 1
extremely generous pay: 1
her briefly and: 1
slytherin dungeons and: 1
advice and said: 1
real slytherining was: 1
harry potter eat: 1
then she realized: 1
know what i: 1
miss patil whether: 1
look expectantly at: 1
real life or: 1
frantically began putting: 1
away even before: 1
vanish when the: 1
would ever live: 1
ask why you: 1
awful words the: 1
them to a: 1
being friendly a: 1
inside her robes: 1
is it daphne: 1
most successful forays: 1
until harry had: 1
least three dark: 1
returned and you'd: 1
first time around: 1
for help or: 1
faculty and if: 1
will vanish when: 1
them to attract: 1
bayesian conspiracy at: 1
and excited guess: 1
down at her: 1
done that wait: 1
for witches was: 1
of the classroom: 1
we'd both like: 1
that witches got: 1
fighting bullies might: 1
harry potter tie: 1
that wasn't quite: 1
feminism business meant: 1
them warning the: 1
was tiptoeing along: 1
to be able: 1
at her left: 1
try a few: 1
will turn and: 1
decided that she: 1
yourself the same: 1
pronounced feminine actually: 1
us where to: 1
stare through the: 1
spell professor quirrell: 1
who'd made fun: 1
little brown stars: 1
which no wizard: 1
her place always: 1
no slytherin would: 1
told by the: 1
putting away her: 1
that doesn't work: 1
he gestured to: 1
boy loomed at: 1
ravenclaw girl's expression: 1
as she spoke: 1
a boy i: 1
a moment after: 1
nodded frightened and: 1
all - lavender: 1
yes and now: 1
that scared me: 1
about wanting to: 1
slytherin or a: 1
out earlier really: 1
around and wandered: 1
ahead and flushed: 1
explained i mean: 1
something - daphne: 1
they went off: 1
mention this the: 1
anywhere but hogwarts: 1
they crept slowly: 1
friends right rianne: 1
only magical school: 1
memories what sort: 1
of them strolled: 1
lost track of: 1
hannah she said: 1
and also what: 1
quirrell points and: 1
there to innocent: 1
tracey chatting with: 1
together by crude-looking: 1
stone walls while: 1
circle actually so: 1
pay of fifty: 1
with a screechy: 1
her robes daphne: 1
direction that led: 1
blurted out i've: 1
bullies the bullies: 1
got to pick: 1
the classroom the: 1
obviously said lavender: 1
homework it was: 1
nasty then hermione: 1
away her parchment: 1
whole point that: 1
part hermione shoved: 1
up and he: 1
cheeks reddened even: 1
really was and: 1
him thirty minutes: 1
eight first-year girls: 1
took out his: 1
stars for the: 1
to salazar slytherin's: 1
again and skylights: 1
could ask harry: 1
left the room: 1
straightened up at: 1
and that meant: 1
on arguing since: 1
start being picky: 1
his servant and: 1
harry had done: 1
orngjce223 has contributed: 1
a daughter of: 1
me miss felthorne: 1
she'd made her: 1
was sitting in: 1
i have for: 1
and looking at: 1
she'd been privately: 1
charms session that: 1
and then after: 1
with harry potter: 1
then observed thoughtfully: 1
closed off further: 1
through the hogwarts: 1
what this was: 1
his bed and: 1
to ambush only: 1
about things before: 1
of marble stairs: 1
something hermione granger: 1
one go past: 1
can i ask: 1
the memories what: 1
finally padma closed: 1
susan as tracey: 1
chair her fingers: 1
hadn't found this: 1
of her bed: 1
private bedroom looked: 1
been privately hoping: 1
simple miss felthorne: 1
and when lavender: 1
the defense professor: 1
flushed tracey's last: 1
he got told: 1
something like this: 1
with us we'd: 1
bit of silence: 1
and what daphne: 1
her ambitions she'd: 1
out everything padma: 1
after all and: 1
in hogwarts any: 1
- draco malfoy's: 1
let shafts of: 1
very rapidly calculating: 1
pocketwatch out of: 1
moment she felt: 1
toward the stairs: 1
maze of twisty: 1
as if she: 1
daphne was approaching: 1
actually finding any: 1
certain and they'd: 1
hermione granger as: 1
half-lidded eyes that: 1
corridor like the: 1
he spun without: 1
in a tone: 1
a word and: 1
that just meant: 1
say that witches: 1
headed into the: 1
own homework it: 1
if they didn't: 1
just a pretty: 1
ask about father's: 1
marked with a: 1
granger to stop: 1
said so draco: 1
a moment it: 1
of them stood: 1
announce the very: 1
that point as: 1
like a real: 1
but that was: 1
him up and: 1
so miss davis: 1
quite let that: 1
started to look: 1
was at least: 1
and i knew: 1
to cast charm: 1
up with professor: 1
the malfoy private: 1
her anywhere near: 1
quirrell thought then: 1
w t year: 1
i've got five: 1
if maybe what: 1
a better opportunity: 1
her thoughts i: 1
by hermione granger: 1
through the corridor: 1
hoping for diamond: 1
heroinic plus the: 1
certain amount of: 1
the other girls: 1
on just on: 1
older in their: 1
could do something: 1
malfoy - who: 1
padma and why're: 1
to follow but: 1
when her head: 1
ghost we've got: 1
feeling in tracey's: 1
other girls look: 1
the one person: 1
and a slytherin: 1
mean what're the: 1
peered out with: 1
consulted a portrait: 1
now she couldn't: 1
this chapter will: 1
into a toilet: 1
and of course: 1
we'd all get: 1
voice low and: 1
and su made: 1
said quite casually: 1
thought with -: 1
her heart well: 1
daphne had considered: 1
with a 0: 1
was that millicent: 1
stairs and then: 1
occurred to tracey: 1
her list of: 1
crossed draco malfoy's: 1
no point if: 1
at all hannah: 1
her robes and: 1
weren't allowed to: 1
it did she: 1
while they were: 1
word of that: 1
do believe that's: 1
out his wand: 1
when the others: 1
and looked at: 1
black-polished shoes she: 1
voice resounding through: 1
the beans millicent: 1
slytherin's ghost we: 1
fiddling with how: 1
to look at: 1
i can't believe: 1
heroine - yes: 1
he must've had: 1
ago in fact: 1
your friends like: 1
in silver snakes: 1
no and so: 1
ancient house so: 1
the young girl's: 1
to show professor: 1
do with feminism: 1
crust and atmosphere: 1
dead end leading: 1
laugh fighting bullies: 1
something about hogwarts's: 1
like daphne's and: 1
a bathroom -: 1
the same boys: 1
what i wanted: 1
fighting bullies hermione: 1
sit down he: 1
anyone else you're: 1
slytherin would dare: 1
while the other: 1
innocent helpless young: 1
walked over millicent: 1
their desks and: 1
like the same: 1
girl did professor: 1
and went around: 1
torches came into: 1
hero the hufflepuff: 1
their walk took: 1
ask what this: 1
door and stared: 1
ask the corridors: 1
of that said: 1
a battle and: 1
could at least: 1
she noticed the: 1
turn the knob: 1
rather sad -: 1
her stomach you: 1
and not just: 1
done she hoped: 1
not hermione's followers: 1
chatting with lavender: 1
ambitions and entered: 1
thing about salazar: 1
her previous plans: 1
he sat down: 1
two-galleon extra with: 1
into a room: 1
her sweetest smile: 1
of silence in: 1
to innocent helpless: 1
an on-the-spot change: 1
of school he: 1
draco said nothing: 1
as he returned: 1
and then another: 1
gryffindor harry's face: 1
being memory-charmed afterward: 1
which sort of: 1
quirrell who was: 1
greengrass brought in: 1
about hogwarts's bully: 1
and came to: 1
look she didn't: 1
draco malfoy's face: 1
wanted to own: 1
at 1 30pm: 1
had to get: 1
the girl was: 1
if i'm saying: 1
whatever harry had: 1
which made it: 1
next time you'd: 1
it shames his: 1
be good for: 1
that was hogwarts: 1
they actually happen: 1
had done she: 1
people looking at: 1
even in hogwarts: 1
if that is: 1
in shut the: 1
to scramble to: 1
said hermione what's: 1
span between the: 1
then her ears: 1
smug then and: 1
ask miss patil: 1
turned through dusty: 1
worried about was: 1
again her cheeks: 1
his unconscious body: 1
we had harry: 1
at exactly the: 1
had argued that: 1
bit during the: 1
slytherin had to: 1
this is going: 1
footsteps and drew: 1
fell across her: 1
for her he's: 1
hoped so anyway: 1
to announce the: 1
left they crept: 1
while she tried: 1
house and not: 1
if she owed: 1
small trembling voice: 1
felthorne nothing now: 1
nimbus 2000 broomstick: 1
ancient duel she'd: 1
could focus on: 1
d'you see which: 1
occasional remarks and: 1
too intense and: 1
all the other: 1
to keep up: 1
she swallowed hard: 1
resulting argument tried: 1
to answer but: 1
parvati had straightened: 1
she was at: 1
problem because if: 1
house strode up: 1
girls look expectantly: 1
of stunning harry: 1
thing you didn't: 1
wearily that she: 1
equally low equally: 1
this was about: 1
his usual drawl: 1
she could you: 1
said are you: 1
the slightest sound: 1
can't believe i: 1
habit of seizing: 1
outside the room: 1
sat down on: 1
lot more respect: 1
but is it: 1
hogwarts's bully problem: 1
that she genuinely: 1
hannah paused with: 1
i'm a hufflepuff: 1
work shouted tracey: 1
that the others: 1
make them look: 1
ask what i: 1
on her own: 1
heroes even though: 1
moment after he: 1
be standing where: 1
to be heroes: 1
with worn cement: 1
robes daphne just: 1
a certain amount: 1
closed it almost: 1
come with me: 1
voice there's a: 1
he drew his: 1
and you'd better: 1
wand then and: 1
to ask about: 1
excited voice what: 1
now that padma: 1
their herbology class: 1
hannah unfeminine said: 1
run across those: 1
with something harry's: 1
mr potter came: 1
get squished like: 1
update at 7pm: 1
library harry said: 1
truly heroinic plus: 1
both seated and: 1
a room that: 1
never straying far: 1
her and it: 1
of led them: 1
as he closed: 1
flattened again and: 1
plaque showing the: 1
miss felthorne said: 1
was approaching the: 1
she likes neville: 1
class having run: 1
they wanted which: 1
you will say: 1
malfoy would be: 1
of mr goyle: 1
hufflepuff girl nodded: 1
daphne but the: 1
behind harry not: 1
of slytherin was: 1
knows everything that: 1
to my room: 1
girls ought to: 1
girl's expression change: 1
dress robes fell: 1
lavender padma and: 1
slytherin's ghost doesn't: 1
see space see: 1
it and her: 1
drawl you will: 1
her not to: 1
rest of us: 1
to her previous: 1
all as she: 1
went on staring: 1
to witch tracey: 1
how do you: 1
carefully continued keeping: 1
guess miss patil: 1
turn and go: 1
general granger who'd: 1
putting her anywhere: 1
potter with us: 1
- yes said: 1
couldn't possibly work: 1
just by doing: 1
house of malfoy: 1
think obviously said: 1
earth's crust and: 1
more if you: 1
most people spent: 1
rich but they: 1
down in malfoy's: 1
e w wasn't: 1
them look as: 1
or if it: 1
they'd followed that: 1
up to the: 1
wanting to impress: 1
head of house: 1
reply is that: 1
trembling voice said: 1
daphne said the: 1
and general granger: 1
and flushed tracey's: 1
to turn the: 1
hermione so she: 1
a boys' bathroom: 1
longest attention span: 1
the difference between: 1
voice soft but: 1
made all the: 1
of them keeping: 1
she didn't quite: 1
them we'd all: 1
of the true: 1
part they went: 1
and now daphne: 1
tell yourself the: 1
going to work: 1
and then stepped: 1
walked on the: 1
sigh and unfortunately: 1
had to do: 1
walking alongside her: 1
daphne had known: 1
in case all: 1
after charm she: 1
out said daphne: 1

hannah opened her: 1
frescos and then: 1
opened her mouth: 1
this is even: 1

up at that: 1
to the table: 1
one after another: 1
equally excited voice: 1
him with us: 1
abbott the nervous: 1
um said hermione: 1
what really makes: 1
and the only: 1
before his expression: 1
mr malfoy gregory: 1
even though that: 1

queasy feeling in: 1
everything that happens: 1
daphne was really: 1
milky way into: 1
sunlight pour down: 1
of ancient style: 1
an empty rock: 1
cavern with a: 1
every word of: 1
they didn't take: 1
hard and visibly: 1
rescue in the: 1
the door and: 1
they were really: 1
i should've figured: 1
swung out her: 1
the whole thing: 1
golden frescos on: 1
click on my: 1
i mean i: 1
gazing at her: 1
feeling like a: 1
in her black-polished: 1
a slytherin after: 1
low menacing voice: 1
felthorne seventh-year of: 1
hermione granger the: 1
would be the: 1

again and said: 1
draco malfoy said: 1
class just barely: 1
do what was: 1
malfoy with a: 1
you surely know: 1
was and whether: 1
think she was: 1
hidden room full: 1
she couldn't guess: 1
as she stepped: 1
pen name less: 1
excuse me said: 1
slytherin's ghost wow: 1
carefully sat herself: 1
in the corridor: 1
and quill when: 1
that hannah had: 1
third-floor corridor like: 1
exactly her heart: 1
legs from the: 1
said um said: 1
muggle lands where: 1
in her life: 1

and waving of: 1
notes for this: 1
and said are: 1
she reminded herself: 1
come to think: 1
work either said: 1
subdued and quiet: 1
around see a: 1
granger the sunshine: 1
on-the-spot change to: 1
they had when: 1
turned to padma: 1
that was probably: 1
witch to witch: 1
to start being: 1
wasn't until harry: 1
skip in her: 1
by crude-looking mortar: 1
snape was taking: 1
instrumental piece titled: 1
her locked his: 1
said that after: 1
the wrong side: 1
you'd better hope: 1
malfoy got told: 1
going to follow: 1
their own interests: 1
do something unpleasant: 1
barely before the: 1
the best way: 1
stone held together: 1
think lord slytherin: 1
charming as his: 1
better opportunity next: 1
got really nasty: 1
hogwarts wards so: 1
then stepped aside: 1
view ca see: 1
off further discussion: 1

you think obviously: 1
their own because: 1
corridors grouted with: 1
said to the: 1
pretty noble girl: 1
bullies to vanquish: 1
told her that: 1
then and began: 1
fast you know: 1
had been led: 1
he was very: 1
oh said padma: 1
meant girls weren't: 1

inquiring look -: 1
hesitated and then: 1
fun than feminism: 1
out afterward but: 1

someone else it's: 1
got into the: 1
bullies i mean: 1
of course harry: 1
conspiratorially come to: 1
desk-chair and millicent: 1

wasting his time: 1
risky it really: 1
she carefully sat: 1
hermione said harry's: 1
friendly then she: 1
the girl did: 1
said something hermione: 1
vote on things: 1
23rd in mountain: 1
slytherin gave a: 1
after professor flitwick: 1
his name and: 1
this meant they: 1
even further while: 1
like the only: 1
bully problem which: 1
him knocking on: 1
piece titled sphere: 1
stood up from: 1

hopeless lump father: 1
their parents had: 1
malfoy miss davis: 1
mr malfoy draco: 1

thoughtfully that even: 1
it's not that: 1
with a malfoy: 1
before sniffing and: 1
just recently -: 1
got no way: 1
hands never straying: 1
or ever if: 1
hermione looked from: 1
even before he: 1
what sort of: 1
at least three: 1
could you don't: 1
to ever end: 1
allowed to pursue: 1
the trouble with: 1
being picky about: 1
notes for the: 1
and it might: 1
locked his intense: 1
fast rumors spread: 1
malfoy gave her: 1
denials don't worry: 1
person whose thoughts: 1
for her own: 1

perfectly groomed even: 1
of sunlight pour: 1
what daphne had: 1
you calling hannah: 1
her left side: 1

that wait here: 1
was already wincing: 1
so flustered that: 1
her voice gentle: 1
draco malfoy and: 1
best way to: 1
padma explained i: 1
said making an: 1
have to answer: 1
he started talking: 1
caught on a: 1
harry's face turned: 1
mother had warned: 1
tracey's idea of: 1
ghost's voice i: 1
past you think: 1
full of treasure: 1
eyes gazed off: 1
thirty seconds she: 1
the two of: 1

she was taking: 1
up on the: 1
i know who: 1
because if we: 1
at and barked: 1
thinking rose from: 1

the other seven: 1
wasn't quite as: 1
my profile click: 1
the entrance to: 1
harry's eyes had: 1
about it which: 1
and fall over: 1
appear in my: 1
least thirty years: 1
hadn't been time: 1
carting his unconscious: 1
far she'd decided: 1
about that -: 1
was waiting just: 1
it might as: 1
had straightened up: 1
in her comfy: 1
a boy who: 1
of seizing opportunities: 1
the bayesian conspiracy: 1
lavender padma made: 1
worried i can't: 1
with a surprised: 1
and then went: 1
that passageway around: 1
record for the: 1
grouted with worn: 1
very tragic this: 1
she was working: 1
decision if s: 1
and dropping his: 1
sixth year in: 1

school he must've: 1
her head sadly: 1
a sickening lurch: 1
the true dungeons: 1

they'd had to: 1
you not to: 1
not even in: 1
longbottom actually daphne: 1
the world's only: 1
exactly the right: 1
month and su: 1
you've got the: 1
twenty-four older bullies: 1
just let her: 1
imperious tones of: 1
of breakfast-time and: 1
daughters and kept: 1

miss davis tracey: 1
closed the door: 1
hermione granger being: 1
began walking toward: 1
- oh said: 1
challenged neville to: 1
ever seen mr: 1

just an instant: 1
that should've put: 1
for bullies to: 1
that couldn't possibly: 1
family might be: 1
of transfiguration and: 1
tracey not even: 1
as elegant and: 1
her desk and: 1
that we're trying: 1
of determination upon: 1
if she couldn't: 1
only figured it: 1
seizing opportunities would: 1
more skeptically afterward: 1
assault a daughter: 1
if this business: 1
coming disaster for: 1
a hufflepuff somewhere: 1
been led around: 1
he said hermione: 1
he closed the: 1
as hannah opened: 1
the bullies wouldn't: 1
she went on: 1
said parvati so: 1
you for being: 1
shuffling out of: 1
she genuinely didn't: 1
miss felthorne nothing: 1
parvati so we: 1
year in hogwarts: 1
from the chair: 1

that is acceptable: 1
said smoothly please: 1
to another boys': 1
padma closed off: 1
and atmosphere and: 1
slinging her bookbag: 1
corner that he: 1
sunshine general what: 1
following us and: 1
for diamond chandeliers: 1
was giving up: 1
whispered keeping her: 1
is that we've: 1
which was also: 1
think that's what: 1
had bounced over: 1
charm after charm: 1
with a plaque: 1
his first morning: 1
were nowhere near: 1
way into a: 1
her frantic spluttering: 1
daphne's mouth was: 1
the others go: 1
about hannah abbott: 1
while she stared: 1
watchful eye on: 1
to take all: 1
two of them: 1
her homework and: 1
to vanquish and: 1
draco malfoy would: 1
what and whatever: 1
far too intense: 1
w did go: 1
of hogwarts all: 1
do is find: 1
tell me tracey: 1
hermione harry said: 1
around nervously to: 1
in her step: 1
said the slytherin: 1
boys' bathroom and: 1
life or if: 1
bed she felt: 1
their time before: 1
her mouth open: 1
them curiously before: 1
followed that passageway: 1
gregory said starting: 1
it almost hitting: 1

there was the: 1
putting her things: 1
chandeliers or golden: 1
wasn't as if: 1
of finding them: 1
shames his name: 1
you didn't even: 1
page so they: 1
get the gossip: 1
a hopeless lump: 1
strange hope dawning: 1
you'd probably tell: 1
hand if the: 1
the third-and-a-halfth floor: 1
by one after: 1
a tight leash: 1
she was a: 1
hermione had thought: 1
she said a: 1
the longest attention: 1
i'll just go: 1
i like the: 1
like mother would: 1
meant that hermione: 1
might as well: 1
a heroine -: 1
might actually be: 1
gloomy bells of: 1
felthorne in sudden: 1
it wasn't as: 1
is still keyed: 1
case they were: 1
- her job: 1
for the whole: 1
opportunity next time: 1
and had sent: 1
way they pleased: 1
first morning of: 1
go around trying: 1

scornfully you don't: 1
the house of: 1
minutes ago in: 1
down he gestured: 1
with the other: 1
their chairs harry: 1
and your extremely: 1
daphne when they: 1
thing to happen: 1
and thirty seconds: 1
was habit-forming if: 1
then turned to: 1
cheeks were already: 1
away inside her: 1
hufflepuff girl flinched: 1
to explain and: 1
and harry see: 1
the first thing: 1
didn't say anything: 1
ghost had leagued: 1
had said about: 1
fingers unthinkingly fiddling: 1
of a robed: 1
who was perfectly: 1
bullies on his: 1
with her mouth: 1
turned around and: 1
we're supposed to: 1
after she got: 1
stomach you don't: 1
a brief rise: 1
and carting his: 1
and silence stretched: 1
he said it's: 1
with how her: 1
intense and before: 1
said slowly i: 1
sudden horror and: 1
five they couldn't: 1
it dawned on: 1
front of daphne: 1
and walked over: 1
unthinkingly fiddling with: 1
his way into: 1
argument tried to: 1
dreadful look of: 1
who i'm destined: 1
there was no: 1
and stared with: 1
peeled for the: 1
right said millicent: 1
eyes on hers: 1
bathroom clearly marked: 1
pacific time of: 1
up slinging her: 1
it was her: 1
wonder if professor: 1
got the rest: 1
around by the: 1
wands but it: 1
deep breath and: 1
ask you for: 1
next time why: 1
tiled stone pavement: 1
them stood before: 1
of emerald plants: 1
thing hannah had: 1
that meant it: 1
on a girl: 1
idea of stunning: 1
girls but that: 1
on daphne that: 1
friend his eyes: 1

and kept her: 1
neville to a: 1
harry potter had: 1

to padma and: 1
took a deep: 1
darted around nervously: 1
child of the: 1
the information she: 1
than you think: 1
amount of weariness: 1
a hundred galleons: 1
try to do: 1

a step up: 1
seemed to consist: 1
her differently even: 1
nervously to look: 1

boy rose from: 1
them keeping both: 1
and they were: 1
drew up and: 1
hannah trying to: 1
strode up to: 1
to achieve her: 1
looked rather smug: 1

when they were: 1

up their walk: 1

their wands as: 1
things to which: 1

the classroom with: 1
you is very: 1
just blurted out: 1
her that the: 1
that the trouble: 1
and parvati had: 1
us we'd run: 1
the ensuing argument: 1
too after the: 1
when the next: 1
dungeons of hogwarts: 1
daphne was sitting: 1
carefully after her: 1
and her n: 1
that when they: 1
even as he: 1
her see hermione: 1
as bad as: 1
daphne's mind tried: 1
added having her: 1
he like finds: 1
more because now: 1
servant and friend: 1
quite as charming: 1
few things to: 1
brick corridors grouted: 1
real slytherin for: 1
said daphne i: 1
closed door and: 1
this the first: 1
and he didn't: 1
and said that: 1
spoke not even: 1
combined quirrell points: 1
the real dungeons: 1
declared in the: 1
them hannah's cheeks: 1
that easy to: 1
toneless voice and: 1
had to stay: 1
next chapter is: 1
that even in: 1
- and then: 1
felt outraged there: 1
class sure enough: 1
and uncreased as: 1
lands where it: 1
soft but everyone: 1
um hannah trying: 1
slowly i mean: 1
she felt somewhat: 1
worry said daphne: 1
she was forcing: 1
meant they were: 1
down a different: 1
bullies might not: 1
the pause and: 1
that said draco: 1
she felt outraged: 1
own part hermione: 1
successfully plotted his: 1
was good enough: 1
turned back toward: 1
felthorne said professor: 1
and tracey um: 1
own interests while: 1
harry said as: 1
professor snape took: 1
yes on fighting: 1
all of father's: 1
she said there: 1
his intense eyes: 1
outfight twenty-four older: 1
her ears caught: 1
mean and he: 1
they went down: 1
ghost is still: 1
in her place: 1
and everburning torches: 1
keep the memories: 1
no daphne said: 1
you can ask: 1
wait what said: 1
this who daphne: 1
with a skip: 1
at all but: 1
the deciding vote: 1
w hermione said: 1
didn't really but: 1
hands almost dropping: 1
stairs that should've: 1
have to ask: 1
feminism and finally: 1
her cheeks reddening: 1
decided that draco: 1
the imperious tones: 1
stretched um okay: 1
fun of her: 1
with them to: 1
don't think this: 1
good enough and: 1
hermione was already: 1
didn't even have: 1
audiobook project of: 1
mother had confessed: 1
anyway miss davis: 1
desk chair even: 1
brown stars salazar: 1
in sudden horror: 1
was trying to: 1
bad with professor: 1
confessed with a: 1
to impress a: 1
given up at: 1
we did find: 1
her cheeks reddened: 1
of homework when: 1
but we've got: 1
wasn't nearly as: 1
though that isn't: 1
brief rise of: 1
it was dawning: 1
draco malfoy's private: 1
the private rooms: 1
hers and said: 1
susan and hermione: 1
everything padma had: 1
into a most: 1
so they can: 1
marry harry potter: 1
said susan and: 1
her side still: 1
room at where: 1
father had gotten: 1
as she frantically: 1
and her gaze: 1
little worried i: 1
good problem because: 1
tracey um said: 1
do you know: 1
wonder if maybe: 1
around conspiratorially come: 1
then after the: 1
for promotion of: 1
had a library: 1
five boys i: 1
but they had: 1
could say that: 1
keep up their: 1
divination and muggle: 1
millicent said in: 1
to the coming: 1
was that hiss: 1
look they had: 1
titled sphere of: 1
project of mor: 1
being friendly then: 1
bugs can't we: 1
don't worry said: 1
rumors spread through: 1
open and headed: 1
granger murmured from: 1
point to going: 1
got more courage: 1
warned her not: 1
low precise voice: 1
he's going to: 1
really millicent said: 1
it daphne looked: 1
this statement as: 1
very feminist it's: 1
did terrible things: 1
that she wanted: 1
parselmouth right away: 1
malfoy's private room: 1
up opportunities was: 1
marry him and: 1
again and he: 1
almost dropping to: 1
her heart the: 1
malfoy will see: 1
which general granger: 1
a robed figure: 1
said as he: 1
owed harry potter: 1
anyway and general: 1
couldn't keep the: 1
bedroom like daphne's: 1
even in the: 1
slytherin for maybe: 1
entirely so it: 1
in fact now: 1
flush of enthusiasm: 1
around the corner: 1
chocolate frogs for: 1
daphne's and the: 1
quickly walked over: 1
out of her: 1
that malfoy's stuff: 1
marble stairs that: 1
down three older: 1
between galaxies which: 1
wrong the door: 1
tracey i bet: 1
had confessed with: 1
were already reddening: 1
attention span in: 1
since professor quirrell: 1
job to figure: 1
day the author's: 1
to look older: 1
impress a boy: 1
lightheaded as she: 1
the first five: 1
thirty minutes ago: 1
how risky it: 1
scramble to keep: 1
put a hand: 1
always looking out: 1
dawned on tracey: 1
in a nervous: 1
also what daphne: 1
voice as low: 1
been sitting on: 1
the same thing: 1
space see a: 1
that all general: 1
and more skeptically: 1
or something -: 1
sudden realization of: 1
deciding vote after: 1
friends with a: 1
at least thirty: 1
you've shared this: 1
before the opening: 1
when lavender and: 1
for this chapter: 1
don't care what: 1
at all as: 1
his face looking: 1
expression puzzled hey: 1
the span between: 1
didn't vote for: 1
just like it: 1
put the entrance: 1
to her forehead: 1
us as friends: 1
witches got to: 1
like we're supposed: 1
n divia melwani: 1
and headed into: 1
and lavender and: 1
one i do: 1
believe me she: 1
small friendly bow: 1
snape of miss: 1
like it that: 1
spluttering and waving: 1
i don't feel: 1
understand the point: 1
battle and they: 1
did find them: 1
unfeminine about wanting: 1
a flight of: 1
that if this: 1
granger as one: 1
galleons is merely: 1
hard before she: 1
tracey's last statement: 1
was working at: 1
padma in a: 1
of actually finding: 1
vanquish and victims: 1
malfoy and it: 1
not've done that: 1
almost hitting harry: 1
all but faculty: 1
and said an: 1
bully parvati had: 1
point if they: 1
toward her and: 1
trying to become: 1
and tracey halted: 1
plus the whole: 1
away even as: 1
off she was: 1
lavender brown who: 1
a hidden room: 1
real dungeons that: 1
she owed harry: 1
hogwarts and then: 1
she lost track: 1
this exclaiming that: 1
run across them: 1
remembered by hermione: 1
and lit by: 1
the corridors and: 1
tracey i don't: 1
them at exactly: 1
the beans someone: 1
voted no and: 1
society for the: 1
hero is that: 1
become a heroine: 1
for female readers: 1
said draco daphne: 1
lone older ravenclaw: 1
parvati sounding puzzled: 1
other hand mother: 1
didn't quite know: 1
she'd challenged neville: 1
probably told him: 1
bulstrode finished her: 1
granger had responded: 1
to work either: 1
anyone of this: 1
a level voice: 1
crept past solemn: 1
expression flattened again: 1
her husbands too: 1
to stun bullies: 1
help with something: 1
the realms of: 1
for not putting: 1
the interstellar dust: 1
a hero the: 1
him what's wrong: 1
- as the: 1
whether it would: 1
fired as they: 1
this made all: 1
up from greengrass: 1
to explain again: 1
trouble just like: 1
that seemed far: 1
that it was: 1
for tracey's idea: 1
is that when: 1
sat herself down: 1
different dusty old: 1
gave a woeful: 1
was what real: 1
malfoy's own chair: 1
no way of: 1
chapter is posted: 1
if we did: 1
saw that hannah: 1
already reddening and: 1
and sit down: 1
nodded again her: 1
that led downward: 1
unlike his usual: 1
still keyed into: 1
professor quirrell who: 1
melwani and shannon: 1
opportunities was that: 1
sealed off to: 1
resounding through the: 1
said about salazar: 1
is a very: 1
her differently it: 1
time why next: 1
something and then: 1
how her dress: 1
down even though: 1
just like daphne's: 1
breath hands almost: 1
several other people: 1
a favor no: 1
that - you: 1
of twisty little: 1
we will turn: 1
all friends together: 1
it took them: 1
by a two-galleon: 1
i've got something: 1
she caught up: 1
they try something: 1
draco daphne finished: 1
girl who was: 1
of a queasy: 1
harry potter with: 1
as draco malfoy's: 1
of everyone in: 1
turned toward her: 1
don't have to: 1
the solemn oaken: 1
malfoy was a: 1
he'd been sitting: 1
know about this: 1
they can coordinate: 1
made it really: 1
own nimbus 2000: 1
span in gryffindor: 1
the gossip so: 1
ghost helping granger: 1
from lavender's own: 1
daphne said as: 1
her again ah: 1
hermione and susan: 1
extra with a: 1
saying said susan: 1
past at one: 1
an equally low: 1
gone gregory came: 1
so he knows: 1
that maybe witchism: 1
millicent i already: 1
find them we'd: 1
to do what: 1
did she was: 1
in mountain view: 1
parvati had to: 1
money for her: 1
lavender hannah paused: 1
differently it was: 1
rose from the: 1
now i don't: 1
a beautiful heroine: 1
the next chapter: 1
forcing herself to: 1
hiss in the: 1
help or they: 1
just shook her: 1
a dead end: 1
better really millicent: 1
name and the: 1
because now you've: 1
when she caught: 1
why you joined: 1
through the maze: 1
it was supposed: 1
slytherin dungeons through: 1
and visibly while: 1
yourself you were: 1
necessary to achieve: 1
unconscious body around: 1
leash and it: 1
if you were: 1
was dawning on: 1
then instead of: 1
have said it: 1
sorts of things: 1
all eight of: 1
hermione tried to: 1
came out into: 1
bit impatient just: 1
that hermione got: 1
a screechy laugh: 1
and victims to: 1
her off and: 1
thought she'd made: 1
said so thank: 1
at that point: 1
sure enough after: 1
my pen name: 1
you mind following: 1
her life and: 1
had responded that: 1
girl had in: 1
show professor quirrell: 1
very simple miss: 1
stairs that led: 1
to the bathroom: 1
all general chaos: 1
supposed to lavender: 1
first meeting of: 1
the chamber of: 1
granger who'd started: 1
hermione she carefully: 1
even though they: 1
daphne stood up: 1
that he drew: 1
know what it: 1
ambitions she'd been: 1
so draco malfoy: 1
her bed quietus: 1
heard footsteps and: 1
got to get: 1
stayed silent for: 1
potter would run: 1
you don't have: 1
stuff was decorated: 1
it well i'll: 1
the only difference: 1
being the daughter: 1
actress and having: 1
both ears peeled: 1
she said to: 1
door flew open: 1
do is go: 1
look - well: 1
don't believe me: 1
his own desk: 1
defeat at least: 1
robed figure whizzing: 1
witch tracey chatting: 1
people have written: 1
nothing to his: 1
witchism could say: 1
was a slytherin: 1
believe i believed: 1
hannah in a: 1
hallways so that: 1
said padma and: 1
and whether it: 1
and when the: 1
it that was: 1
guess at all: 1
let her see: 1
flinched as she: 1
had probably told: 1
he tells you: 1
reputation as a: 1
daphne that being: 1
female readers of: 1
making an on-the-spot: 1
meetup for female: 1
not putting her: 1
the spell professor: 1
a corner that: 1
other hand if: 1
said you can: 1
voice what is: 1
about was if: 1
hand mother had: 1
was going to: 1
you don't believe: 1
puzzled hey millicent: 1
it out afterward: 1
was probably just: 1
on odd-numbered days: 1
generous pay of: 1
trouble with passing: 1
face started to: 1
she got into: 1
and threw it: 1
thought and it: 1
the potions master: 1
in her heart: 1
of whatever day: 1
walk off in: 1
merely to compensate: 1
earlier really there: 1
then went down: 1
secrets in a: 1
with half-lidded eyes: 1
tell us where: 1
by doing the: 1
thoughts i mean: 1
able to outfight: 1
snape but since: 1
shafts of sunlight: 1
which made tracey: 1
- daphne couldn't: 1
dark openings and: 1
lavender had argued: 1
low equally excited: 1
and ask the: 1
n e w: 1
dropping his head: 1
and then he: 1
- rose up: 1
went wrong it: 1
and turned around: 1
gotten mother to: 1
her voice low: 1
with me miss: 1
up first-year girls: 1
forehead and was: 1
a skip in: 1
dungeons that she'd: 1
further while she: 1
the boy loomed: 1
davis the boy: 1
old still her: 1
was about to: 1
do the forbidden: 1
was very rapidly: 1
of girl did: 1
potter and carting: 1
charm she lost: 1
skeptically afterward daphne: 1
information i was: 1
further discussion by: 1
that day ended: 1
reverting back in: 1
brain had gone: 1
if we had: 1
for enemy soldiers: 1
be worth it: 1
fatality rate and: 1
and having just: 1
on his first: 1
girls looked at: 1
she started stammering: 1
like finds slytherin's: 1
then another below: 1
looking relaxed would: 1
tried to wrap: 1
hufflepuff somewhere but: 1
but since the: 1
toward her locked: 1
and she saw: 1
daphne declared in: 1
library session scheduled: 1
had also found: 1
growled mr goyle: 1
they've got to: 1
it for them: 1
servants to her: 1
they had a: 1
through hogwarts now: 1
like professor quirrell: 1
the girl walking: 1
said the low: 1
wouldn't like it: 1
that there's a: 1
britain was so: 1
i was just: 1
us and began: 1
goyle and went: 1
stood up slinging: 1
you're right said: 1
taking everything except: 1
her wand away: 1
his time the: 1
stop bullies and: 1
potter anything and: 1
a low precise: 1
was also certain: 1
way and padma: 1
rapidly calculating something: 1
mr malfoy will: 1
room at all: 1
this convincing padma: 1
miss felthorne and: 1
look as elegant: 1
was ordinary mr: 1
could pool their: 1
i wonder if: 1
was that it: 1
easy to become: 1
the others looked: 1
eye on their: 1
maybe the first: 1
of how many: 1
bullies because of: 1
the table she: 1
better hope he: 1
waiting for a: 1
salazar slytherin what: 1
as she went: 1
sorting hat for: 1
anything for the: 1
with a strange: 1
got to look: 1
i wanted for: 1
to sound a: 1
felt somewhat lightheaded: 1
way of actually: 1
standing where looking: 1
really worried about: 1
conspiracy at columbia: 1
a single torch: 1
quite know what: 1
outraged there was: 1
like the hufflepuff: 1
white and fall: 1
known that hers: 1
sunshine general had: 1
in this case: 1
point of a: 1
achieve her ambitions: 1
for maybe the: 1
the architecture reverting: 1
very good problem: 1
loud i might: 1
were waiting for: 1
and was leaning: 1
snape's toneless voice: 1
the rest of: 1
followers like professor: 1
business meant girls: 1
her hermione tried: 1
boys i like: 1
will say nothing: 1
and quiet the: 1
while tracey's eyes: 1
opportunities would mean: 1
should've put them: 1
little bit of: 1
really makes someone: 1
floor if it'd: 1
supposed to mean: 1
he didn't say: 1
hermione's followers like: 1
expression didn't change: 1
nearly as bad: 1
to see them: 1
that she had: 1
waving of hands: 1
a nervous voice: 1
small bedroom like: 1
draco malfoy with: 1
book as he: 1
upon her face: 1
draco malfoy gave: 1
you want to: 1
to marry said: 1
head darted around: 1
i ask miss: 1
worn cement which: 1
said in an: 1
victims to rescue: 1
multiple people have: 1
in tracey's stomach: 1
enough after professor: 1
a decision if: 1
from their wands: 1
what real slytherining: 1
all she hoped: 1
should i not've: 1
so daphne had: 1
mother to marry: 1
an instant before: 1
thought then they: 1
out i've got: 1
the sound of: 1
and for a: 1
five minutes i: 1
it open and: 1
a plaque showing: 1
for a favor: 1
so fast you: 1
was no room: 1
to stop bullies: 1
granger being in: 1
of miss hermione: 1
at the same: 1
wow i guess: 1
he returned and: 1
casually his face: 1
wand away inside: 1
difference between having: 1
all hannah she: 1
of political education: 1
mouth - it's: 1
that since padma: 1
tracey that -: 1
su made like: 1
that's who the: 1
millicent bulstrode finished: 1
was a battle: 1
and defeat at: 1
granger thought and: 1
looking at it: 1
expression excuse me: 1
off in the: 1
wait here growled: 1
really nasty then: 1
edit andrew rettek: 1
snape think she: 1
potter came the: 1
that this meant: 1
bells of doom: 1
malfoy what did: 1
education she tried: 1
his wand then: 1
as he stepped: 1
phoenix or what: 1
been sealed off: 1
hanging open and: 1
want him to: 1
of greengrass brought: 1
figured out said: 1
meant it well: 1
the awful thing: 1
father's advice and: 1
said parvati we've: 1
was back to: 1
millicent to turn: 1
trying to stun: 1
passing up opportunities: 1
between the end: 1
soldiers to ambush: 1
i'm destined to: 1

he didn't regret: 1
and harry went: 1
close now but: 1
and harry remembered: 1

anthony goldstein and: 1
can't do it: 1
to look -: 1
don't ask the: 1
succeed upon this: 1

but didn't say: 1
love his own: 1
calm the dementors: 1

even more dangerous: 1
the lesser bird: 1
really really good: 1

and fall away: 1
forgotten so long: 1
shining phoenix vanished: 1

backwash of emptiness: 1
two patronuses were: 1
from that dementor: 1

harry's spine then: 1
accept the bargain: 1
and rowena passed: 1

professor quirrell wants: 1
out to test: 1
that could only: 1
eyes trying to: 1
creatures harry had: 1
quieter than his: 1
hideous silence lord: 1

her only kept: 1
clear that muggles: 1
more than half: 1
out of her: 1

what's the point: 1
still studying the: 1
they weren't happy: 1
magic that moved: 1

past uncounted she: 1
harry looked up: 1
patronus charm which: 1
any decaying mummy: 1
so don't be: 1

kilometers per hour: 1
fans were treating: 1
let out of: 1
granger just decide: 1
and harry fell: 1
sounding coldly amused: 1
and helga had: 1
you you will: 1
there is the: 1
daphne greengrass and: 1
harry's magic failed: 1
than him that: 1

hollow the spell: 1
students milling about: 1
you weren't happy: 1
deathly fury beginning: 1
her eyes then: 1
coming true somehow: 1
near it said: 1
spree with his: 1
life to his: 1
the cloak came: 1
painful to look: 1
and snow-spotted grass: 1
that didn't stop: 1
recognize their approach: 1
all in a: 1
failures didn't mention: 1
guess how long: 1
into bitterness black: 1
embarrassed or regretful: 1
or wand and: 1
and every time: 1
as she saw: 1
alone forty -: 1
you can never: 1
like hitting something: 1
moonlight paced back: 1
his mother and: 1
hogwarts swung open: 1
a word there'd: 1
black fury deathly: 1
even in front: 1
try again and: 1
understand morag macdougal: 1
train himself to: 1
lupin's voice and: 1
wise advice but: 1
mind see something: 1
you looked at: 1
far away from: 1
said the headmaster: 1
shriek flinched -: 1
the wand motions: 1
first gestures the: 1
fire along with: 1
any way for: 1

and clearly audible: 1
charm to defend: 1
older and stronger: 1

to hogwarts and: 1
that to be: 1
me any advice: 1
and she saw: 1
just your happy: 1
some books claimed: 1
place again she: 1
you as a: 1
but you will: 1
way it was: 1
the headmaster harry: 1
ignore the whispers: 1
i admit i: 1
quietly walked toward: 1
she was still: 1
white phoenix appeared: 1
the day the: 1

able to produce: 1
harry saw that: 1
hadn't failed you're: 1
books had confirmed: 1
at the same: 1
for the day: 1
way flitwick roared: 1
what is right: 1
leaving her son: 1
sensitive subjects it: 1
i'd probably feel: 1
as hermione understood: 1
thought that lord: 1
stupidity professor quirrell: 1
confusion to automatically: 1
couldn't remember the: 1
eyes opened dead: 1
the senior auror: 1
the other first-years: 1
because professor flitwick's: 1
burning cold for: 1
led toward the: 1

time harry had: 1
comments i am: 1

courage not less: 1
voice of burning: 1
it was something: 1
agreement headmaster dumbledore: 1

yellowing dried grass: 1
into the initial: 1
flare of green: 1
worse than any: 1
eyes widening in: 1

for them to: 1
from his wand: 1
he was going: 1

the standards of: 1
day then the: 1
pushing it not: 1

he escorted anthony: 1
well said the: 1
and simple somehow: 1
extra careful and: 1
next student maybe: 1
the difference in: 1
knives there was: 1
something harry would: 1
who were supposed: 1
yourself to die: 1
harry had already: 1
interval between when: 1
though only to: 1
to himself every: 1
around to look: 1
think you should: 1
being informed that: 1
with great presence: 1
the tiny professor: 1
object trying to: 1
doesn't mean we're: 1
a positive direction: 1
looking disappointed or: 1
the hardest decision: 1
lain almost touching: 1
of you as: 1
seriously imagined that: 1

students professor flitwick: 1
that her nightmare: 1
you were eleven: 1
trembling i asked: 1

her only once: 1
dean thomas roared: 1

to that the: 1
dementors he had: 1
for occlumency barriers: 1
harry dying mum: 1
potter seriously imagined: 1
fly on a: 1
his eyes peering: 1
became stupidity professor: 1
don't think about: 1
or that wasn't: 1
his accustomed boom: 1
had felt hollow: 1
he projected confidence: 1
boy in his: 1
his tone now: 1
between anthony goldstein: 1
enough guess i: 1
arrived by then: 1
save your child: 1
best strategy she: 1
try mr potter: 1
of the other: 1
for trying to: 1
the other voice: 1
it and said: 1
attempts using five: 1
that is all: 1
a shriek professor: 1
believed in souls: 1
to learn that: 1
started to feel: 1
fine friends and: 1
another thing not: 1
there just that: 1
had told his: 1
known cases of: 1
power over her: 1
and father and: 1
five bars of: 1
and i knew: 1
remembered and tried: 1
quirrell seemed to: 1
and then answered: 1
way you learned: 1
watching everyone since: 1
not in a: 1
voice having come: 1
all right for: 1
looked very very: 1
still seemed unfocused: 1
and the other: 1
before but other: 1
one and told: 1
you can do: 1
that in the: 1
his wand gave: 1
have been harry: 1
vitality not just: 1
not expecting to: 1
again and his: 1
tastiest parts first: 1
hogwarts where the: 1
parvati patil had: 1
dementor a different: 1
was the sunshine: 1
winter grounds yellowing: 1
and ran expecto: 1
not rusted away: 1
of hogwarts where: 1
easily pierce for: 1
strange sounds beginning: 1
up his wand: 1
his silver bird: 1
searching for happier: 1
four times with: 1
reflex scrabbled for: 1
the shame of: 1
charm which was: 1
understand what type: 1
open question harry: 1
for some of: 1
it like she'd: 1
if they had: 1
have still existed: 1
of whatever lay: 1
been gentle or: 1
of fear and: 1
otter harry whispered: 1
hermione came to: 1
near it harry: 1
rest before you: 1
house i give: 1
harry looked under: 1
she looked stressed: 1
auror turned to: 1
the headmaster's deeper: 1
to flee said: 1
vast doors of: 1
them ignore the: 1
but she was: 1
please stop trying: 1
were many robes: 1
mind said if: 1
made it even: 1
harry's lieutenants maybe: 1
lemonade were also: 1
the end even: 1
was something horribly: 1
focus and dart: 1
one eventually that: 1
but each drawing: 1
headmaster if i: 1
weren't getting those: 1
you were too: 1
into his mind: 1
came up in: 1
said dryly but: 1
hiss of a: 1
the words like: 1
longbottom had seen: 1
orangutan of solid: 1
calling out the: 1
tried to gather: 1
saw i didn't: 1
can never have: 1
suspect this entire: 1
mother and father: 1
memory occurred to: 1
fear and as: 1
probably feel a: 1
i didn't look: 1
the silent night: 1
laughter and then: 1
was even more: 1
he'd told anyone: 1
the looks of: 1
happy thought but: 1
its power over: 1
end of lily: 1
and beautiful as: 1
sorting hat in: 1
lying dead on: 1
you think i: 1
itself the sun: 1
to be able: 1
eyes those two: 1
then depart leaving: 1
flinched - -: 1
shut up but: 1
dementor exposure at: 1
only bold and: 1
true words of: 1
hadn't shown up: 1
corporeal patronus and: 1
come next but: 1
wouldn't give it: 1
either of them: 1
said the voice: 1
quirrell said dryly: 1
he tried to: 1
knows you it: 1
chocolate professor flitwick: 1
and i realized: 1
safe even for: 1
on using the: 1
if harry had: 1
or some sleep's: 1
execute criminals it: 1
and professor quirrell: 1
failed them somehow: 1
students told no: 1
even quieter than: 1
away that's how: 1
initial position it: 1
they weren't making: 1
i can't harry: 1
even after harry: 1
run away instead: 1
here how if: 1
his own wings: 1
within him the: 1
his footsteps no: 1

an eleven-year-old wizard: 1

it and hannah: 1
just to get: 1
hundred kilometers per: 1
cloak why am: 1
quirrell pointed out: 1

summon potter's wand: 1
tiny pathetic shriek: 1
a slight chill: 1
your soul and: 1
something else something: 1
we're going to: 1
of hogwarts harry: 1
harry was there: 1
let his mind: 1
of his book-shopping: 1

magic godric had: 1
variance in how: 1
in souls he: 1
to hermione granger: 1
and dad dying: 1
brandished it and: 1
was the worst: 1
as he scanned: 1
great doors of: 1
saw that hermione: 1
grow older ah: 1
dementor harry glanced: 1
want to stay: 1
dementors could drain: 1
the forest and: 1
understood but twenty: 1
roles seemed to: 1
mistake after being: 1
his form and: 1
her voice trembled: 1
at the end: 1
which made it: 1
time he tried: 1
back harry had: 1
peregrine falcon had: 1
slightly as he: 1
the same sidelong: 1
the dementor smashed: 1
holding out clearly: 1
and stalked to: 1
seconds more there: 1
exchanging worried looks: 1
at last lily: 1

and vanished in: 1

he brought harry: 1
snow the human: 1

quietly your wandwork: 1
he let that: 1
bet that's what: 1
that was when: 1
like a brand: 1
snow-spotted grass seamus's: 1
a few small: 1
didn't stop you: 1
pride and status: 1
harry was afraid: 1
for the first: 1
nothing not yet: 1

to something harry: 1
dementor could not: 1
human figures still: 1

shouted professor flitwick: 1
thing that was: 1
let us hope: 1
her direction he'd: 1
go to a: 1
felt a twinge: 1
his first year: 1
asked harry to: 1
even as neville: 1
goldstein called the: 1
on and helga: 1

had taught the: 1
morag macdougal had: 1
that red and: 1
charm no matter: 1
where she'd fallen: 1

trying to see: 1
automatic they weren't: 1

to say he'd: 1
brushing at his: 1
headmaster to give: 1

somehow the fact: 1
the blazing phoenix: 1
memory the worst: 1
was when ignorance: 1
his fingers into: 1
supposed to cast: 1
while harry nodded: 1
the curse rapid: 1
the victims and: 1

his reputation that: 1

worse about that: 1
the permanent mindless: 1

the way it: 1
headmaster was racing: 1
but even as: 1
past three corporeal: 1
age he'd brought: 1
quirrell came forward: 1
dumbledore was smiling: 1
with distress as: 1
bad person plain: 1
grass leading her: 1
if i can: 1
because she asked: 1
helpful the early: 1
take me kill: 1
she brandished it: 1
compassion in mr: 1
five attempts using: 1

i'll go in: 1
your heart the: 1
down harry's spine: 1
and laid on: 1

godric had died: 1
dive faster than: 1
and on his: 1
a spell that: 1
clearly empty hands: 1
harry had seen: 1
otter hermione said: 1

figures still small: 1
of strength that: 1
ought to make: 1
horror beneath the: 1
the empty thing: 1

crimson eyes seeming: 1
so did many: 1

when he confronted: 1

thin high-pitched scream: 1
harry's favorite animal: 1

very tall man: 1
that's what a: 1
as one eventually: 1
goryanof from where: 1
the part of: 1
coldly amused i: 1
it knows you're: 1

if you hadn't: 1
quirrell everyone shouted: 1
trying to force: 1
slight chill went: 1
i accept the: 1
phrasing professor quirrell: 1
school harry do: 1

automatically flinch away: 1
something horribly humiliating: 1
feeling of them: 1
power hit people: 1
white light from: 1
people who can't: 1
grass hermione couldn't: 1
as bright and: 1
solid moonlight paced: 1
loving memories a: 1
had said headmaster: 1
first time harry: 1
to send messages: 1
harry brought the: 1
she wouldn't see: 1
than unhappy harry: 1
godric had taught: 1
was all most: 1
been dismissed as: 1
enough books but: 1
and he wondered: 1
advantage to the: 1
from now on: 1
answered a very: 1
parvati patil who: 1
had silently apologized: 1
stressed earlier she'd: 1
to speak he: 1
how long it: 1
this morning and: 1
kiss to execute: 1
crack of fire: 1
harry's mind began: 1
people which was: 1
patronus in his: 1
quiet calm he: 1
best to train: 1
harry whispered happier: 1
strength that you: 1
about you're not: 1
resistance and a: 1
to her too: 1
sometimes also harry's: 1
helga had promised: 1
was seen to: 1
still that interval: 1
it usually rested: 1
toward where the: 1
tired unbelievable said: 1
magic and your: 1
she was thinking: 1
a little so: 1
hermione knew it: 1
away the light: 1
distances the ministry: 1
to run away: 1
all her limbs: 1
scream that seemed: 1
tarnished but not: 1
you his trick: 1
harry was suddenly: 1
and wondered if: 1
the dementor twisted: 1
foolish woman if: 1
it i didn't: 1
helium temperatures and: 1
the students milling: 1
he spoke no: 1
faster and deeper: 1
to harry happened: 1
not harry not: 1
false and so: 1
blinked hard a: 1
people became dark: 1
rowena passed before: 1
politely step aside: 1
that irresistible force: 1
to hurt but: 1
reached out grabbed: 1
to wizards than: 1
whose failure had: 1
wand even as: 1
sere winter grounds: 1
would have drawn: 1
chocolate even after: 1
couldn't cast a: 1
one harry didn't: 1
kill her and: 1
had produced a: 1
going to hurt: 1
that let them: 1
spots of dim: 1
can't remember now: 1
a few times: 1
out that adults: 1
felt wrong harry: 1
goldstein and the: 1
to come from: 1
though not the: 1
harry turned around: 1
places with him: 1
where the way: 1
temperatures and laid: 1
expecto patronum said: 1
black wand was: 1
the aurors' patronuses: 1
the horrible fear: 1
the final brandish: 1
will not save: 1
logical something strange: 1
still feeding on: 1
godric gryffindor also: 1
it was that: 1
head and let: 1
time and then: 1
the armies he'd: 1
fall the headmaster's: 1
goryanof tall and: 1
at the confusion: 1
blind spot under: 1
final time to: 1
to think that: 1
of hermione came: 1
duellist was fiddling: 1
house you choose: 1
for even ten: 1
for the chocolate: 1
to liquid helium: 1
toward where harry: 1
said at once: 1
have to be: 1
suddenly appearing fawkes: 1
student could muster: 1
that the headmaster: 1
was her final: 1
the distance the: 1
seemed to focus: 1
the dementor's fear: 1
even as hermione: 1
the chaos legion: 1
and then ernie: 1
you this rare: 1
mercy have mercy: 1
couldn't rely on: 1
upon that is: 1
still feeds on: 1
was racing toward: 1
if you made: 1
if she thought: 1
be neville longbottom: 1
sort of dead-shaped: 1
twitched his wand: 1
headmaster had arrived: 1
get your patronuses: 1
what happy thought: 1
hands but each: 1
whisper grayish and: 1
looked up remus: 1
remus shook his: 1
range for its: 1
professor quirrell's eyes: 1
warned that was: 1
that did not: 1
to acknowledge it: 1
me the face: 1
students it was: 1
dark side fell: 1
and tracey davis: 1
remus lupin was: 1
only once and: 1
failures were sitting: 1
to me through: 1
students quirinus i: 1
for you i: 1
had promised him: 1
she thought that: 1
first year and: 1
last day he'd: 1
a pathway that: 1
or just weakened: 1
field at first: 1
crying the slytherins: 1
the winter trees: 1
since he was: 1
usual that was: 1
instead the empty: 1
started crying you: 1
he was imagining: 1
in maturity between: 1
cloak was very: 1
if he was: 1
battle magic godric: 1
that made anthony's: 1
i should have: 1
she ran toward: 1
his visual cortex: 1
me instead the: 1
helplessly i mean: 1
help but think: 1
emptiness caressing at: 1
harry had planned: 1
to train himself: 1
else either because: 1
and settle on: 1
charm in practice: 1
of snow the: 1
felt wrong to: 1
most so you: 1
it should have: 1
never occurred to: 1
be an otter: 1
thought do you: 1
different kind of: 1
of magic than: 1
with their patronus: 1
to drive the: 1
stronger miss granger: 1
didn't talk about: 1
even as the: 1
he confronted the: 1
the dementor was: 1
different and then: 1
of harry listened: 1
that sounded much: 1
finally when his: 1
before it was: 1
the ministry thought: 1
happened not a: 1
stand by your: 1
grim auror komodo: 1
not trouble myself: 1
the wand a: 1
much progress there: 1
it knows you: 1
image the dementor: 1
status to be: 1
light from his: 1
without any respect: 1
patil who succeeded: 1
only a little: 1
neville longbottom and: 1
harry wondered if: 1
was not warning: 1
depths of his: 1
respect for occlumency: 1
make a happy: 1
by a few: 1
thought desperately at: 1
spot of silver: 1
quirrell's eyes then: 1
of greater benefit: 1
spell under those: 1
signed up for: 1
him away from: 1
of himself without: 1
told harry often: 1
and he would: 1
he didn't approach: 1
because there shouldn't: 1
creatures of fear: 1
see him and: 1
was also calm: 1
harry nodded that's: 1
forward a few: 1
to make it: 1
looks i did: 1
you're brandishing your: 1
close to the: 1
i shall understand: 1
going to end: 1
to drive it: 1
the sun was: 1
will learn you: 1
patronus charms had: 1
a while harry: 1
not the same: 1
wand so that: 1
and fall the: 1
they heard harry: 1
toward where some: 1
his face stayed: 1
by that and: 1
let that image: 1
had to try: 1
her shoulders and: 1
and screamed at: 1
and harry who: 1
been a good: 1
lily potter and: 1
she'd been crying: 1
informed that you: 1
hermione granger just: 1
can dive faster: 1
repeated maybe people: 1
not harry screamed: 1
suddenly afraid to: 1
was beginning to: 1
no his mind: 1
lot worse about: 1
wasn't difficult because: 1
the headmaster if: 1
unafraid and to: 1
direction he'd stepped: 1
flitwick were exchanging: 1
the aurors everyone: 1
which was another: 1
and whatever it: 1
saw an open: 1
he looked at: 1
a kind of: 1
he wouldn't tell: 1
thinking of rowena: 1
have been purely: 1
like slipping on: 1
helping hermione from: 1
the dementor's cage: 1
entire mind became: 1
to wonder if: 1
at the difference: 1
filling harry's whole: 1
ministry committee of: 1
harry potter's horrible: 1
try because sometimes: 1
death here will: 1
gryffindor wasn't a: 1

for warmth but: 1
confidence even though: 1
that yes it: 1
next to something: 1
a whisper i: 1
dumbledore in a: 1
felt like hitting: 1
a worried look: 1
armies he'd raised: 1
had claimed that: 1
it even worse: 1
confronted the darkest: 1
hogwarts and yet: 1
voice rose to: 1
the start though: 1
standing just behind: 1
else she meant: 1
everyone to shut: 1
whatever it was: 1
you will learn: 1
something in the: 1
who could and: 1
let harry try: 1

harry said logical: 1
and that this: 1
young student could: 1
ring in the: 1

it needed too: 1
precise phrasing professor: 1
using a patronus: 1
his eyes trying: 1
limbs cold as: 1
it which will: 1
on him and: 1
of his robes: 1
don't go near: 1

to think they: 1
hermione realized then: 1
harry's imagination but: 1
down as the: 1
were like that: 1
without even trying: 1
salazar had abandoned: 1
the neural patterns: 1
toward her only: 1
dying everyone dying: 1
the dementor miss: 1
favorite animal since: 1
horrible contemptuous laughter: 1
imagination but professor: 1
asianish-looking man solemn: 1
brandished it a: 1
running with a: 1
himself again the: 1
people had been: 1
try there was: 1
the ordinary way: 1
hermione smiled but: 1
anthony back toward: 1
either because all: 1
she was always: 1
arms and bore: 1
few small remnants: 1
patronum nothing happened: 1
spell a spell: 1
coma into which: 1
he'd conjured without: 1
simple somehow the: 1
you couldn't rely: 1
unraveling and shot: 1
the aurors harry: 1
the entire scene: 1
go to that: 1
his sleep shut: 1
then there were: 1
when you -: 1
him or an: 1
hermione what about: 1
who wish to: 1
any of it: 1
first-years who'd signed: 1
certainty that some: 1
imagination because there: 1
to slide sideways: 1
to execute criminals: 1

command get your: 1
a blind spot: 1
of their year-mates: 1
of existence and: 1
what she ought: 1
we grow older: 1
light a fading: 1
made anthony's wand: 1
teach you his: 1
getting those looks: 1
eyes still seemed: 1
she saw it: 1
felt the same: 1
and - hermione: 1
flitwick don't let: 1
powerful wizard in: 1
won't sabotage me: 1
fast enough to: 1
to be all: 1
the data but: 1
instead of trying: 1
whispers of their: 1
before down down: 1
would lose much: 1
they were enough: 1
and the brighter: 1
twenty seconds then: 1
had been dismissed: 1
phoenix bellowed professor: 1
yet the cloak: 1
of metal cooled: 1
anthony said firmly: 1
which it put: 1
give you you: 1
with what then: 1
strayed far from: 1
vanished and the: 1
in dark blue: 1
at exactly the: 1
of the wounded: 1
a man with: 1

repairing his reputation: 1
had a feeling: 1
chair he'd conjured: 1
me through three: 1
his footsteps if: 1

memories or some: 1
patronus right away: 1
had arrived by: 1
dark side how: 1
so i said: 1
patronus charm seemed: 1
how ridiculously overconfident: 1
it because it: 1
logic the dementor's: 1
voice finished first: 1
of the school: 1
the library to: 1
there were gasps: 1
wounded in the: 1
children saw harry: 1
headmaster said still: 1
cold and darkness: 1
tried to put: 1

more there was: 1
kept harry's feet: 1
them or maybe: 1
and yet for: 1
to wizardkind if: 1
to automatically flinch: 1
the tears were: 1
to choose wrongly: 1
as genius it: 1
the eyes those: 1
thing for him: 1
angst he couldn't: 1
not hear the: 1
the world seemed: 1
it will do: 1
tell you what: 1

bright white panther: 1
neville had been: 1
dying so that: 1
- but she: 1
otherwise know no: 1
test the next: 1
not yet the: 1
so the gestures: 1
them from elsewhere: 1
something false and: 1
barrier across his: 1
the dementor it's: 1
imagining himself feeling: 1
could drain your: 1
starting to congregate: 1
seemed equally at: 1
absentminded pokerface as: 1
a good man: 1

he'd felt the: 1
will render them: 1
not easily pierce: 1
you make a: 1
horror expecto patronum: 1

firmly don't think: 1
eyes never strayed: 1
muggles from wizards: 1
mistake but harry: 1
eyes had silently: 1
until the dementor: 1
trying to resist: 1
step aside foolish: 1
the approaching fear: 1
hopeful look or: 1
turned and ran: 1
little so she: 1
to be searching: 1

great accomplishment to: 1
temporarily demented as: 1

he could feel: 1
ke- the lethal: 1
lapel of his: 1
of emptiness caressing: 1
them burning terribly: 1
as you say: 1
wand it wasn't: 1
the cloak why: 1

on the grass: 1
within the huge: 1
harry often wizards: 1
waited too long: 1
looked under the: 1
feeling of confusion: 1
half the ones: 1

of wood zooming: 1
into hermione's mouth: 1
headmaster's voice was: 1
head i'm sorry: 1
as an image: 1
cookies and lemonade: 1
the voice said: 1
cause or another: 1
sorry hermione said: 1
he dared what: 1
than his i: 1
mean sort of: 1
a certainty that: 1

what he shouldn't: 1
the headmaster looked: 1
charm wizards who: 1
corners of their: 1
said quietly your: 1
the killing curse: 1
twitched your wand: 1
forty - but: 1
swallowed she was: 1
try and teach: 1
to cast your: 1
to be precise: 1
line between harry: 1
quirrell pointlessly because: 1
screams of the: 1
it had guarded: 1
as his face: 1
told to get: 1
squeaked professor flitwick: 1
stick of wood: 1
harry had ever: 1
dared what do: 1
rested on his: 1
dementor say how: 1
patronus and when: 1
then anthony tried: 1
to pierce their: 1
to try one: 1
hermione and walked: 1
cloak what did: 1
it put the: 1
thought harry said: 1
by your friends: 1
all her friends: 1

professor quirrell but: 1
her toward the: 1
studying the wand: 1
know what was: 1
potter's voice shrieked: 1
now supposed to: 1
harry to please: 1
and he and: 1
harry hadn't been: 1
world seemed equally: 1
think your animal: 1
had been glancing: 1
blinding flare of: 1
enough to shut: 1
fading reflex scrabbled: 1
again like it: 1
them had gone: 1
an orangutan of: 1
thoughts before he'd: 1
the resting auror: 1
a thin high-pitched: 1
cage came closer: 1
you're not just: 1
grayish and slimy: 1
send him back: 1
for its attack: 1
make you think: 1
books claimed the: 1
as he brought: 1
and his voice: 1
cast it said: 1

it lay within: 1
her mind something: 1
solemn without being: 1
like miniature suns: 1
man who was: 1
to anthony anthony: 1
spread its wings: 1
wasn't even in: 1
the headmaster as: 1
it had brought: 1
for the table: 1
voice whatever was: 1
ran expecto patronum: 1
other she can't: 1
harry couldn't see: 1
form i see: 1
cold darkness there: 1
the spell under: 1
in a ponytail: 1
meant you might: 1
that he glanced: 1
ordinary way but: 1
were vast and: 1
glow bright red: 1
professor flitwick were: 1
to stare at: 1
actually get to: 1
the headmaster's eyes: 1
and an astounding: 1
parts first said: 1
had said a: 1
with anyone that: 1
as death her: 1
her eyes the: 1
a little weary: 1
well said dumbledore: 1
after being warned: 1
already cannonballing toward: 1
and so he: 1
focused on professor: 1
name that wasn't: 1
wand and his: 1
fell down into: 1
down down as: 1
the exposed and: 1
dead and left: 1
went on screaming: 1
successes among the: 1
time and -: 1
of courage had: 1
is right in: 1
the fastest living: 1
if you didn't: 1
a thought that: 1
of his dark: 1
patronum said the: 1
lord voldemort with: 1
was most advantageously: 1
a man's voice: 1
victims and that: 1
it twenty seconds: 1
true somehow it: 1
spoke the words: 1
the other ravenclaws: 1
rose the memory: 1
after the first-years: 1
then as he: 1
a great burst: 1
knows you're here: 1
wizardry had only: 1
the snacks table: 1
read harry harry: 1
much weaker than: 1
of strength from: 1
morning and i: 1
girl who was: 1
harry when he'd: 1
an otter said: 1
tall decaying robes: 1
it either people: 1
a young boy's: 1
else something that: 1
animal since forever: 1
from elsewhere to: 1
i mean i: 1
light did anthony: 1
in horror -: 1
hold him off: 1
had thought it: 1
little laughter when: 1
and the cry: 1
you couldn't be: 1
a voice that: 1
to learn it: 1
gray stone back: 1
you in the: 1
inside him that: 1
without word or: 1
a single flicker: 1
word or wand: 1
was finnigan of: 1
toward the snacks: 1
so thought harry: 1
both going to: 1
all his tastiest: 1
watching the dementor: 1
sounding a little: 1
confess had never: 1
blinking hard and: 1
but other students: 1
can only grow: 1
or if you: 1
been any way: 1
wizard in the: 1
books okay harry: 1
was a blind: 1
hermione didn't know: 1
man with a: 1
afraid hermione granger: 1
and fly by: 1
other students whose: 1
hands seconds ticked: 1
feel a touch: 1
his voice trembling: 1
had no luck: 1
give you this: 1
smiling slightly as: 1
said dumbledore and: 1
said to anthony: 1
said the empty: 1
the things harry: 1
have come next: 1
then what she: 1
learning it when: 1
of shock even: 1
was an asianish-looking: 1
claimed the dementor's: 1
was taking security: 1
case harry's magic: 1
starlit memory held: 1
long after the: 1
silently apologized and: 1
overprotectiveness and if: 1
hesitation it can: 1
was a really: 1
or regretful you: 1
grave i think: 1
and go it's: 1
professor quirrell paused: 1
happy those blazing: 1
i did not: 1
his tastiest parts: 1
me harry looked: 1
dare look at: 1
fled before the: 1
rather than unhappy: 1
on a chair: 1
i heard all: 1
bellowed expecto patronum: 1
guess i should: 1
the first-years awaiting: 1
hands were all: 1
in case harry's: 1
headmaster dumbledore looked: 1
there after all: 1
had been written: 1
the lethal voice: 1
me so thought: 1
this was pushing: 1
dying i can't: 1
book back to: 1
stepped toward her: 1
again the bodiless: 1
all saw it: 1
learned to fly: 1
moving forward herself: 1
take a rest: 1
bargain yourself to: 1
last try it: 1
out of existence: 1
reach past three: 1
almost done for: 1
than to muggles: 1
the dementor even: 1
dark lords in: 1
harry's convulsing body: 1
certainly safe even: 1
was the best: 1
cloak this was: 1
or deeply wise: 1
their attempts and: 1
tried to complete: 1
he had to: 1
shouldn't do was: 1
and the blazing: 1
seen harry dying: 1
book with an: 1
emptiness brushing at: 1
his calls and: 1
soft inner center: 1
without hesitation it: 1
they would remember: 1
brandish his wand: 1
remaining half had: 1
and he knew: 1
four times shifted: 1
grass of winter: 1
gestures of the: 1
sense in you: 1
going to strangle: 1
still here it: 1
with anthony instead: 1
title like the: 1
bird spread its: 1
didn't that made: 1
destroying their souls: 1
slide accelerated as: 1
the dementor horror: 1
the hiss of: 1
in how hard: 1
him back the: 1
who'd had no: 1
wand to drive: 1
and her voice: 1
shoulders and followed: 1
before i came: 1
anthony anthony looked: 1
out the next: 1
thing right from: 1
of it whereupon: 1
it spoke to: 1
corporeal patronus it: 1
void of his: 1

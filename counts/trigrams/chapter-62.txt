she was saddened: 1
hovering in front: 1
their place and: 1

like coughing up: 1
again in a: 1
the bend to: 1
away all of: 1
not a realistic: 1
had worn the: 1
this when gandalf: 1

the dark lord's: 1
compared to the: 1
if not younger: 1
to the bottom: 1
words not the: 1
moody bartemius crouch: 1

in a whisper: 1
yes and then: 1
of those times: 1

stared at him: 1
had seen him: 1
past his natural: 1
need change little: 1

the many good: 1
of terror in: 1
that the throne: 1
he would if: 1

and codes that: 1
it need change: 1
his voice was: 1
wizard in a: 1
harry listen please: 1

and harry peeked: 1
black has been: 1
and banging its: 1
envelope into the: 1
perches a bright: 1
cost to yourself: 1
see the necessity: 1
even as you: 1
anything to say: 1
it hard to: 1
did understand i: 1
to dementors azkaban: 1
scream had been: 1
that she couldn't: 1
mcgonagall's own lips: 1
voices he'd heard: 1
this burden that: 1
winging toward him: 1
the most unforgivable: 1
had been told: 1
to ask your: 1
a new body: 1
seen it and: 1
people mixed in: 1
but it must: 1
to death percival: 1
soared over the: 1

since doing it: 1
a candle-flame what: 1
he had heard: 1
of the rings: 1
flap and flap: 1
written in large: 1
thing that gandalf: 1
had expressed her: 1
a reckoning but: 1
never raise in: 1
a high-pitched hiss: 1
fawkes he was: 1
in front of: 1
learning from you: 1
professor to note: 1
for its classes: 1
knock at the: 1
her to say: 1
only the confrontation: 1
which made it: 1
eyes were calm: 1
principle of course: 1
am mistaken let: 1
grade had been: 1
blood is the: 1
someday we'll listen: 1
could've done all: 1
saying harry said: 1
destroy any dementor: 1
nothing for any: 1
fourth-year student named: 1
message and codes: 1
stopped your little: 1
the same only: 1
mcgonagall by now: 1
find a sickle: 1
bulstrode had a: 1
be told what's: 1
they had no: 1
for any threat: 1
give him nothing: 1
way to put: 1
desk barren but: 1
equal and he: 1
not wish the: 1
later the portrait: 1
ministry will issue: 1
nine nazgul swoop: 1
about how she: 1
escape unscathed but: 1
whether i could: 1
the fatigue off: 1
for weeks and: 1
order's families and: 1
phoenix upon his: 1
and said headmaster: 1
and she said: 1
what do you: 1
customary appearance except: 1
of the slytherin: 1
harmful not ever: 1
rock - she: 1
sharing really good: 1
his own can: 1
the confrontation with: 1
have no right: 1
merry tavington and: 1
false harry in: 1
was happening inclined: 1
understand amelia bones: 1
his cheeks his: 1
herself to look: 1
set back in: 1

harry fighting you-know-who: 1
was stern his: 1
the corners of: 1
all to set: 1
wizards had not: 1
embarrassed that old: 1
opened and merry: 1
it through a: 1
monocle and sighed: 1
this sort of: 1
only with a: 1
you remember it: 1
told me that: 1
wizard but this: 1
turned back then: 1
piercing scream why: 1
phoenix that will: 1
ministry caw there: 1
second requisite voldemort: 1
voldemort needs to: 1
voice then he: 1
that this book: 1
was a sham: 1
either harry said: 1
been only a: 1
i really wish: 1
may come back: 1
one more but: 1
wizard's face to: 1
whole view of: 1
another pause and: 1
just something it's: 1
evil even some: 1
last envelope on: 1
legs could manage: 1
safety water was: 1
if his suspicions: 1
that frodo held: 1
ring at once: 1
headmaster he was: 1
wizard phoenixes do: 1
imposed costs on: 1
anyway a choking: 1
afterward the obscure: 1
to ask you: 1
to speak for: 1
done if he: 1
wish the portrait: 1
harry could think: 1
first book he: 1
from albus dumbledore's: 1
is marked as: 1
you have read: 1
all the devices: 1
will be nothing: 1
supposedly because muggleborns: 1
mask was set: 1
a feeling it: 1
for the summer: 1
between taking the: 1
tavington the envelope: 1
she said anything: 1
think fawkes caw: 1
returned as was: 1
they did cryptography: 1
my place to: 1
she almost called: 1
to the eyes: 1

house gryffindor for: 1
closer about yourself: 1
side and the: 1
to blackmail and: 1
its lesser beginnings: 1
directly and saw: 1
have of me: 1
didn't think i: 1
this way he: 1
and my parents: 1
beginning at the: 1
better than nothing: 1
this day forth: 1
she was nervous: 1
harry potter the: 1
she'd watched enough: 1
open the oaken: 1
was just what: 1
gave her a: 1
where fawkes had: 1
out to the: 1
had not bothered: 1
be helped please: 1
at least say: 1
at him it: 1
read real life: 1
safe now minerva: 1
longer taking lunches: 1
those people to: 1
realized was a: 1
comparison harry just: 1
would be waiting: 1
old wizard and: 1
them evil and: 1
mask that same: 1
in their place: 1
harry potter to: 1
had encountered the: 1
the tears began: 1
yes there is: 1
the words came: 1
twins' though not: 1
wizard himself standing: 1
trouble meeting his: 1
time-turner then not: 1
to picture in: 1
you hate me: 1
stared at the: 1
was feeling the: 1
door behind him: 1
of his time-turner: 1
see it the: 1
nothing i can: 1
- to take: 1
on the old: 1
raged and screamed: 1
was trying to: 1
doesn't there and: 1
one of three: 1
in an instant: 1
codes in cryptography: 1
mixed in with: 1
been told to: 1
you're feeding people: 1
voice that said: 1
up everything now: 1
headmaster still does: 1
just wants you: 1
invisible harry potter: 1
already going under: 1
wizard standing among: 1
others will that: 1
grow stronger and: 1
what was that: 1
to set aside: 1
the ministry will: 1
stared at what: 1
cold his dark: 1
charm to float: 1
realized even then: 1
i to break: 1
without already knowing: 1
knowing all harry: 1
front of him: 1
say after instead: 1
and then the: 1
heart again as: 1
by a sanded: 1
him they did: 1
fire you're not: 1
what does a: 1
explain but if: 1
was built it: 1
that out loud: 1
she had been: 1
enough she'd watched: 1
merry tavington the: 1
looked on his: 1
outstanding on her: 1
harry the inner: 1
belonged - but: 1
was hard enough: 1
perched there as: 1
voice dumbledore's blue: 1
clearly harry was: 1
devices in their: 1
gate to dumbledore's: 1
slightly for the: 1
a name written: 1
now rested on: 1
enough to fend: 1
get you to: 1
trust in him: 1
clearly they're hurting: 1
her mind the: 1
now i've got: 1
whole war when: 1
the nine nazgul: 1
while the silent: 1
the two angers: 1
of the lord: 1
had invented that: 1
corners of harry's: 1
the formal black: 1
cells - harry: 1
him the cold: 1
prophecy and they: 1
man named arthur: 1
within an alternate: 1
heard a scream: 1
from this day: 1
seen his father: 1
and silver numerals: 1
he knows that: 1
an instant if: 1
his eyes were: 1
it against him: 1
potter-evans-verres but please: 1
think about this: 1
harry stopped at: 1
cold and the: 1
that he'd received: 1
that stopped major: 1
of his pouch: 1
a whisper i: 1
had perched saw: 1
up lava -: 1
cry harry had: 1
a realistic depiction: 1
of thinking about: 1
the library here: 1
and in their: 1
was now flying: 1
the conversation the: 1
of the world: 1
them someday we'll: 1
what would you: 1
told them but: 1
sighed and turned: 1
portrait door opened: 1
remaining spin of: 1
for an early: 1
take them out: 1
they might give: 1
toward him from: 1
scattered over the: 1
to receive it: 1
and began to: 1
easy to picture: 1
how winning a: 1
had heard so: 1
had burst into: 1
out loud expecto: 1
tell fawkes for: 1
the jerking motion: 1
original prophecy echoed: 1
maybe i should: 1
for me to: 1
and the hot: 1
right now maintaining: 1
left rivendell without: 1
looked again into: 1
true and original: 1
weird then i: 1
most unforgivable that: 1
said and then: 1
sickles waiting for: 1
her at the: 1
shame considering how: 1
little she knew: 1
eyes grown hard: 1
oppose the will: 1
thing to do: 1
the boy had: 1
moments later the: 1
the voters have: 1
the orphans so: 1
taking the serious: 1
nodded yes and: 1
slow motion as: 1
began pouring freely: 1
nothing dark or: 1
a message from: 1
focused in the: 1
had been obvious: 1
not like stories: 1
of anything to: 1
of that hadn't: 1
own can you: 1
at him they: 1
on the cloak: 1
harry spun and: 1
is why they: 1
until after he: 1
wizard's hand came: 1
give me one: 1
albus had said: 1
when the nine: 1
rather slowly nodded: 1
while the outer: 1
this whole day: 1
desk harry the: 1
marked as the: 1
choked as the: 1
forward reaching out: 1
mysterious unknown devices: 1
named margaret bulstrode: 1
he's only a: 1
professor quirrell if: 1
message from professor: 1
- why didn't: 1
five sickles waiting: 1
like it so: 1
been taken from: 1
up as though: 1
mary's place and: 1
artifact to escape: 1
behind it so: 1
mischief yes unspeakable: 1
yet it is: 1
people of a: 1
frodo would have: 1
but somehow even: 1
own guilt came: 1
her she was: 1
can't understand -: 1
or maybe the: 1
your war in: 1
had the same: 1
nestled his head: 1
is not my: 1
did cryptography first: 1
so harry retreated: 1
that same self: 1
just take the: 1
albus dumbledore and: 1
at all like: 1
he spoke this: 1
me be corrected: 1
the first book: 1
it is time: 1
dark side was: 1
note down the: 1
do another piercing: 1
empty the desk: 1
still seemed true: 1
wizard continued it: 1
came a knock: 1
formidable though not: 1
if not i: 1
but what would: 1
not the sharpness: 1
the spiraling staircase: 1
prophecy echoed once: 1
and take them: 1
alastor moody bartemius: 1
flaring up and: 1
phoenix now are: 1
that comes near: 1
do before i: 1
stop them and: 1
his eyes meeting: 1
in the air: 1
now maintaining the: 1
hours earlier but: 1
are never again: 1
recognized a quote: 1
at the corners: 1
dumbledore's office but: 1
the door and: 1
off his face: 1
to her a: 1
the floor she: 1
and confess -: 1
his own scream: 1
pastimes but a: 1
just stared at: 1
was another pause: 1
they are animals: 1
desperate begging as: 1
boy who wavered: 1
him how could: 1
think i could: 1
that you are: 1
the two umbrellas: 1
somehow even that: 1
a little embarrassment: 1
the obvious test: 1
a moment that: 1
ever beneath that: 1
pass off the: 1
flames in a: 1
for easter harry: 1
for now and: 1
for she had: 1
once more through: 1
anything why didn't: 1
everything there was: 1
will extend them: 1
into that seal: 1
mcgonagall had meant: 1
the very last: 1
absolutely no idea: 1
it closer about: 1
something about the: 1
and he is: 1
i can't cried: 1
what to say: 1
envelope to the: 1
final sickle into: 1
the matter the: 1
in their customary: 1
find some way: 1
gazed up at: 1
meeting harry's instead: 1
had also been: 1
in azkaban i: 1
stopped at a: 1
to rise as: 1
nod then slipped: 1
voldemort is returned: 1
there was another: 1
at your convenience: 1
i'm glad to: 1
say to that: 1
dumbledore strode forward: 1
saw the phoenix's: 1
a flash of: 1
he'd received a: 1
message from me: 1
harry's attention voldemort: 1
like a cowl: 1
first harry then: 1
the phoenixes are: 1
muggles at all: 1
that message and: 1

at least not: 1
someone tried the: 1
there quickly and: 1
at the envelope: 1
harry was sobbing: 1
him nothing for: 1
put the difference: 1
strange voice that: 1
shock to the: 1
order i'm sorry: 1
eyes on the: 1
the cost to: 1
be done harry: 1
to you for: 1
in azkaban -: 1

whole every time: 1
that fawkes because: 1

potency gathered about: 1
hoarsely percival dumbledore: 1
that seal then: 1
b she wasn't: 1
how she used: 1
it was as: 1
hours to three: 1
that boy approached: 1

once by gandalf: 1
soon a man: 1
lay the entrance: 1
that harry had: 1
but you are: 1
he strode away: 1
of gossip before: 1
suit very ancient: 1
still spreading through: 1
and made all: 1
passed the voices: 1
like fire at: 1

it wasn't escape: 1
gathered about him: 1
blaze crackled in: 1
the shire while: 1

harry's voice said: 1
in the future: 1
to his face: 1
not glow and: 1
nothing but cruelty: 1
rings by j: 1
its head against: 1
that i might: 1
someday we'll get: 1
scrolls in minas: 1
from that book: 1
the faint green: 1
better that we: 1
like the books: 1
him she forced: 1
from you harry: 1
times upon dumbledore's: 1
she forced herself: 1
moved frodo to: 1

harry put that: 1
of a falling: 1
every time they: 1
of misusing my: 1
office but since: 1
door that was: 1
them as your: 1
harry then blazed: 1
alerted the few: 1
he'd passed the: 1
chaos and for: 1
stone gargoyle walked: 1
harry whispered you: 1
smoothly aside to: 1

are to play: 1
merry snatched up: 1
i say them: 1

i ought to: 1
inside of the: 1
of harry could: 1

reaching out to: 1
bothered keeping time: 1
down of a: 1
their portraits it: 1
not live together: 1
was the final: 1
power the dark: 1
and said in: 1
done it then: 1
out when the: 1
trembling voice later: 1
hurting - we: 1
match the person: 1
on an eleven-year-old: 1
on a lower: 1
that mattered to: 1
important thing the: 1
to three o'clock: 1
they blazed red: 1
peeked around the: 1
clear voice then: 1
side she remembered: 1
their visits but: 1
few staircases later: 1
is a certain: 1
a plausible excuse: 1
harry entered his: 1
evil do you: 1
parents will see: 1
forgotten about fawkes: 1
and she wondered: 1
to be moved: 1
maybe they follow: 1
- harry's eyes: 1
she knew what: 1
rose up from: 1
trust his own: 1
folly do you: 1
- of their: 1
and facing dumbledore: 1
bears voldemort's signature: 1
that the phoenix: 1
if after this: 1
life is not: 1
on the shire: 1
in puzzlement looking: 1
as i say: 1
headmaster told you: 1
through a monocle: 1
said his quavering: 1
was empty the: 1
gargoyle walked smoothly: 1
fallout afterward i: 1
professor quirrell thinks: 1
harry whirled looked: 1
blood purists wished: 1

you're angry at: 1
the shift in: 1
already on a: 1
had already succeeded: 1
phoenix's eyes gazing: 1
you once defeated: 1
harry had not: 1
the corridors of: 1
escape he took: 1
time-turner and b: 1
another five sickles: 1
i understand the: 1
i would give: 1
harry just nodded: 1
of professor mcgonagall: 1
from where a: 1
reply after you: 1
when she was: 1
costs on others: 1
then that she: 1
she waited her: 1
first kind of: 1
any more the: 1
potter but i: 1
does not recognize: 1
true that if: 1
he deserves that: 1
an unused classroom: 1
harry didn't know: 1
mr potter the: 1
to wait at: 1
slytherin dungeons striding: 1
nazgul swoop down: 1
right to ask: 1
if there were: 1
her envelope and: 1
said i am: 1
a few staircases: 1
old wizard his: 1
r tolkien you: 1
point doesn't there: 1
something a phoenix: 1
obvious test well: 1
be imagined they: 1
realized that fawkes: 1
- flap flap: 1
imagine harry fighting: 1
it with more: 1
said softly your: 1
the main thing: 1
used it e: 1
look at dumbledore: 1
difference noticed the: 1
voice or an: 1
further into his: 1
she was delaying: 1
and been inconsolable: 1
professor mcgonagall the: 1
had said he: 1
not wise that: 1
his throat tell: 1
said from his: 1
dumbledore when he: 1
been the main: 1
he heard the: 1
been inconsolable for: 1
to where his: 1
from sybill trelawney's: 1
the innocent harry: 1
dementor that comes: 1
you grow stronger: 1
if harry potter: 1
headmaster had decided: 1
strode away from: 1
fawkes didn't understand: 1
lord four times: 1
no longer taking: 1
anticipated it he'd: 1
harry stood and: 1
ordinary first-year albus: 1
except the old: 1
amelia bones alastor: 1
lord of the: 1
it will automatically: 1
formal nod then: 1
putting on the: 1
nothing left of: 1
where harry stood: 1
remembered the one: 1
knew was that: 1
down on the: 1
priorities in an: 1
barren but for: 1
i'm to receive: 1
it e g: 1
she wondered for: 1
few times upon: 1
some evils harry: 1
dumbledore that this: 1
envelope on which: 1
the air like: 1
mere animals but: 1
mistaken let me: 1
you i would: 1
know that if: 1
family i have: 1
change and i: 1
would find another: 1
- you were: 1
last remaining spin: 1
robes on that: 1
margaret bulstrode slytherins: 1
throat like coughing: 1
the hourglass back: 1
before the old: 1
them z-p-g-b-s-y space: 1
harry potter would: 1
not my place: 1
anyway wondering whether: 1
the metal doors: 1
old wizard can: 1
reason she couldn't: 1
who had absolutely: 1
perhaps wiser here: 1
sleeping figures start: 1
it's just more: 1
war when the: 1
that hours earlier: 1
true and therefore: 1
hourglass had served: 1
hours whereupon she: 1
back at him: 1
he wouldn't like: 1
right thing to: 1
harry looked on: 1
anything interesting unless: 1
her younger self: 1
from harry's eyes: 1
harry retreated a: 1
figures start within: 1
thought of that: 1
so you are: 1
understand - i: 1
the phoenix fawkes: 1
awful sickness inside: 1
banging its head: 1
gazing back at: 1
receive it ': 1
a warning that: 1
we have to: 1
which was written: 1
said just what: 1
well if i: 1
five sickles along: 1
a foot taller: 1
i can't there's: 1
the inner bulwarks: 1
necessity do you: 1
fiddly things the: 1
of your fellows: 1
idea what was: 1
not that simple: 1
serious ludicrously and: 1
knows that i: 1
looked down at: 1
you recognize the: 1
a piercing cry: 1
and a sickle: 1
everything then said: 1
halfway to the: 1
force would be: 1
and sane the: 1
lava - fawkes: 1
z-p-g-b-s-y space f-v-y-i-r-e-b-a-g-u-r-g-e-r-r: 1
been you cannot: 1
nothing while something: 1
beneath that mischief: 1
outstanding grade had: 1
she'd seen in: 1
when professor mcgonagall: 1
knew what the: 1
muggleborns could not: 1

up from his: 1
many at a: 1
and find a: 1
the emotions inside: 1

then the boy: 1
to come here: 1

said dumbledore that: 1
then harry shifted: 1

the boy shook: 1
reckoning but sometimes: 1
all but when: 1
i've got to: 1
own face this: 1
horror but what: 1
fatigue off his: 1
own dark side: 1
even with professor: 1
old wizard's cheeks: 1

mcgonagall said enter: 1

harry had seen: 1
one hour earlier: 1
where is it: 1
this on an: 1
wizards could not: 1

battles in the: 1
boy seated himself: 1
that parchment in: 1
shrugged it'll play: 1
the difference into: 1
the door with: 1
bright cheerful blaze: 1
wizard his voice: 1
with gentle wing-sweeps: 1
expression on the: 1
oaken door that: 1
a sea of: 1
said harry not: 1
be in danger: 1
him and realized: 1
my parents in: 1
of harry's defenses: 1
it wasn't until: 1
silver on the: 1
said hufflepuff within: 1
not for the: 1
hurting myself -: 1

you caw oh: 1
bellatrix black has: 1
too slowly as: 1
do what do: 1
a government have: 1
to weep it: 1
and an envelope: 1
but since harry: 1
waited her eyes: 1

it up and: 1
pen out of: 1
there were two: 1
and merry snatched: 1
about it anyway: 1
she would have: 1
very foolish thing: 1
to recall not-seeing: 1

that we live: 1
boy said quietly: 1
just in case: 1
allowed to fall: 1
shoulder at where: 1
was hovering in: 1
never again leaving: 1
case of war: 1
and kept walking: 1
a lot more: 1
rose in surprise: 1
recall not-seeing anyone: 1
to dumbledore's office: 1
they did not: 1
head against harry's: 1
to escape azkaban: 1
fawkes and the: 1
to shield her: 1
said in a: 1
now seemed to: 1

the sharpness that: 1
another piercing scream: 1
fellows openly or: 1
winning a battle: 1

time harry then: 1
tucked the hourglass: 1
swoop down on: 1
declared rebellion against: 1
collapsed all his: 1
mcgonagall's eyes rose: 1
timed by a: 1
i think i: 1
not think so: 1
recognize them as: 1
though not dangerous: 1
and dying down: 1
could get you: 1
the headmaster's gargoyles: 1
going home to: 1
now there is: 1
ought to decide: 1
harry turned and: 1

his side the: 1
destiny this prophecy: 1

something about dumbledore: 1
he'd go to: 1
the things that: 1
before anyone else: 1

convenience there was: 1
one error is: 1
the serious ludicrously: 1
and therefore minerva: 1
flitwick and bear: 1

to let harry: 1
her muggle studies: 1
not perfectly good: 1
harry are those: 1
it pierced through: 1

he walked away: 1
if it's fine: 1
animals but they: 1
at once by: 1
on that person: 1
but somehow waiting: 1
hogwarts a few: 1
harry's eyes down: 1

a guard strong: 1
out of their: 1
sybill trelawney's throat: 1

that served as: 1
striding as quickly: 1
not i am: 1
by now so: 1
smashed harry didn't: 1

who wavered between: 1
not frodo alone: 1
she has escaped: 1
saw - why: 1

wizard had already: 1
staircase and slammed: 1
intelligent and sane: 1
groups of fifteen: 1

a moment to: 1
hand already going: 1
so command frodo: 1
wizard from within: 1
following message to: 1
lay this upon: 1
mischief with all: 1
the battle is: 1

with a pleading: 1
- yes there: 1
be dropped off: 1
in his eyes: 1
pure and complete: 1

before i ought: 1
lost their war: 1
i'm afraid it: 1
- harry whispered: 1
me wizards could: 1
you will see: 1
a little further: 1
butter collapsed all: 1
layers like a: 1
in a parchment: 1
step forward his: 1
phoenix was still: 1
a strange voice: 1
harry and facing: 1
i am suspected: 1
to borrow everything: 1
things that blood: 1
having used the: 1
the headmaster wishes: 1
not ever beneath: 1
parents to let: 1
smart the wise: 1
war - fury: 1

had received an: 1
to attack the: 1
through him and: 1
hover charm to: 1

these letters exactly: 1
the flaring up: 1
remember if harry: 1
dressed in robes: 1
and survived each: 1
the same cold: 1
his shoulder at: 1

to make a: 1

harry only she: 1
that gandalf does: 1
off any attack: 1
very last envelope: 1
michael and petunia: 1
- fawkes no: 1

worn the calm: 1
wandpoint was too: 1

then slipped out: 1
now are you: 1
way professor quirrell: 1
me to break: 1
that old wizard: 1
this which made: 1
harry shifted his: 1
shoulder perched there: 1
father wearing a: 1
say the things: 1
the headmaster -: 1
was as if: 1
as when professor: 1
dungeons striding as: 1
cry split the: 1
voice was begging: 1
make the arrangements: 1
yourself it didn't: 1
during their visits: 1
test well it: 1
has been taken: 1
three steps at: 1
wasn't until he: 1
voldemort's signature if: 1
please at least: 1
have found it: 1
something it's evil: 1
that person it: 1
prison inescapable the: 1
helped please let: 1
expression and kept: 1
sheet of paper: 1
been focused in: 1
is possible to: 1
then blazed up: 1
had to borrow: 1
were innocent the: 1
to think of: 1
each declared rebellion: 1
or an order: 1
from deputy headmistress: 1
the boy rose: 1
and called message: 1
natural bedtime it: 1
said headmaster i: 1
- we have: 1
shifted his gaze: 1
shift in his: 1
wizard's cheeks dripping: 1
imagine it and: 1
deputy headmistress's office: 1
shirt and he: 1
was that message: 1
but a little: 1
and harry potter: 1
mistaken right now: 1
happened minerva knew: 1
for understanding the: 1
was saddened to: 1
understand how winning: 1
not paper out: 1
to see the: 1
in case of: 1
that a request: 1
just nodded and: 1
main thing that: 1
nothing in theory: 1
before i started: 1
that it is: 1
down at the: 1
hurt all middle-earth: 1
and as true: 1
where a phoenix: 1
it came as: 1
that hadn't anticipated: 1
warmth still spreading: 1
of a young: 1
the glasses it: 1
you fight if: 1
your way -: 1
cryptography codes that: 1
that was the: 1
something watching from: 1
eleven-year-old boy this: 1
else had heard: 1
the mysterious devices: 1
mcgonagall said briskly: 1
into words and: 1
phoenix already launched: 1
stern his eyes: 1
but not wise: 1
watcher screamed in: 1
it must be: 1
danger but i: 1
that he had: 1
you could today: 1
my parents to: 1
could stop them: 1
the ludicrous seriously: 1
to get you: 1
after he heard: 1
would think about: 1
my parents for: 1
an edict that: 1
potter and voldemort: 1
that it had: 1
who knew his: 1
seemed less like: 1
cruciatus curse could: 1
wizard wrenched his: 1
and yet they: 1
you are no: 1
i need to: 1
eyes gazing back: 1
a point i: 1
that voldemort is: 1
flying next to: 1
of invisibility harry: 1
had told me: 1
three requisites he: 1
said briskly i'm: 1
an early breakfast: 1

about the plan: 1
numerals the jerking: 1
obtain to rise: 1
himself standing tall: 1
flitwick silver on: 1
left of the: 1
by j r: 1
countermeasure later he: 1
and voldemort fight: 1
without hating them: 1
harry's defenses like: 1
it is possible: 1
though not even: 1
knew nothing said: 1
even knowing that: 1
am sorry harry: 1
there's nothing i: 1
the day he: 1
he wants me: 1
said the voice: 1
and he knows: 1
to so command: 1
their customary appearance: 1
you i will: 1
knew her younger: 1
as you imposed: 1
he still knows: 1
facing dumbledore at: 1
though beseeching so: 1
to me and: 1
unspeakable unthinkable mischief: 1
that at least: 1
did but there: 1
toward the inside: 1
choking sound came: 1
confess - fawkes: 1
an instant as: 1
if harry had: 1
and the sorting: 1
their masters can: 1
anything about governments: 1
even that small: 1
if she said: 1
to say that: 1
at hogwarts during: 1
harry said the: 1
they would have: 1
it out said: 1
and trying to: 1
which already had: 1
of a wizarding: 1
if anyone stands: 1
mind she had: 1
potter was easy: 1
floor of hogwarts: 1
said anything at: 1
caw said the: 1
seem more suspicious: 1
it did but: 1
are considered national: 1
with professor quirrell: 1
spell it out: 1
was still on: 1
about dumbledore when: 1
be with you: 1
eleven-year-old boy she: 1
little further into: 1
to kill an: 1
mean i was: 1
at the phoenix's: 1
your guardians i: 1
change your whole: 1
that she was: 1
the house elves: 1
found it awkward: 1
saw a coldness: 1
can you truly: 1
you couldn't save: 1
by gandalf himself: 1
dumbledore at his: 1
harry had said: 1
stories do you: 1
unused classroom after: 1
at a time: 1
his shoulder harry: 1
you anything you: 1
of harry's attention: 1
take the ring: 1
red-golden bird was: 1
you think fawkes: 1
force would you: 1
choose wizards to: 1
perched saw the: 1
idea keep it: 1
back to me: 1
they differed always: 1
sword through butter: 1
of the war: 1
than nothing in: 1
in a clear: 1
could bear this: 1
frodo to rivendell: 1
was done for: 1
wax to seal: 1
those robes on: 1
write these letters: 1
on the outside: 1
so now i've: 1
made it hard: 1
find five sickles: 1
received an outstanding: 1
another envelope which: 1
souls who can: 1
him a few: 1
the inner part: 1
in case someone: 1
that blood purists: 1
possible to oppose: 1
dumbledore's harry looked: 1
not bothered keeping: 1
same cold alert: 1
next to harry: 1
i headmaster i'll: 1
evil and enemy: 1
the phoenix's wings: 1
spin of his: 1
after ten years: 1
came out of: 1
of the innocent: 1
and with his: 1
feeling it didn't: 1
the political fallout: 1
eaters learned toward: 1
only a boy: 1
right no right: 1
been greatly inconvenienced: 1
been embarrassed that: 1
ask him this: 1
old wizard if: 1
embarrassment and awkwardness: 1
they each declared: 1
neutral the words: 1
golden fire you're: 1
old wizard in: 1
what is going: 1
it had burst: 1
invisible somehow his: 1
couldn't look at: 1
old wizard it: 1
encountered the dark: 1
into his shirt: 1
were there you: 1
in a high-pitched: 1
mind even as: 1
hope but if: 1
the intelligent and: 1
nervous and the: 1
maintained like an: 1
saw that it: 1
the mask of: 1
boy looked at: 1
fawkes for me: 1
country have to: 1
do the right: 1
off harry as: 1
had a plausible: 1
terrible hollow voice: 1
cold alert look: 1
shield her and: 1
he had a: 1
again is that: 1
do anything why: 1
headmaster thought it: 1
that a margaret: 1
did not wish: 1
something of the: 1
would come a: 1
old scrolls in: 1
inescapable the old: 1
harry and even: 1
not told them: 1
day the young: 1
parents for easter: 1
danger do they: 1
a boy still: 1
never fought voldemort: 1
toward where harry: 1
day forth because: 1
a pause then: 1
the bright expression: 1
instant as he: 1
six hours to: 1
taking the ludicrous: 1
fawkes because i: 1
azkaban she has: 1
green wax to: 1
have said are: 1
to look at: 1
of fifteen -: 1
and give the: 1
the headmaster told: 1
crack before the: 1
not dangerous his: 1
9pm since doing: 1
will serve you: 1
there and if: 1
to oppose the: 1
sickles along with: 1
said again is: 1
national possessions harry: 1
pouch and told: 1
the time the: 1
easter harry you: 1
to match the: 1
was taking all: 1
not my phoenix: 1
she had a: 1
in an unused: 1
good and yet: 1
true harry the: 1
it anyway but: 1
she his most: 1
with moody at: 1
into the corridors: 1
as though in: 1
to rise again: 1
come back to: 1
and original prophecy: 1
to use your: 1
around whose final: 1
few moments later: 1
you had to: 1
something what does: 1
though in slow: 1
conversation from this: 1
upon an eleven-year-old: 1
definitely constituted a: 1
fawkes screamed the: 1
the earth entire: 1
if they each: 1
the stone gargoyle: 1
clock the golden: 1
a country have: 1
and saw a: 1
hogwarts anyway a: 1
was a strange: 1
there you saw: 1
old wizard from: 1
long enough to: 1
not even the: 1
in the eyes: 1
be - there: 1
exhaustion by the: 1
ran as deep: 1
just give it: 1
it can't be: 1
frodo should never: 1
and saw that: 1
some point doesn't: 1
terrible cry harry: 1
the few souls: 1
spun he saw: 1
the door-handle a: 1
people you couldn't: 1
for all the: 1
he'd just misunderstood: 1
it didn't mean: 1
as his own: 1
hat into not: 1
as the emotions: 1
us around hoping: 1
plans and pastimes: 1
made the wizard: 1
for the few: 1
- as though: 1
possessions harry weapons: 1
awkwardness and inconvenience: 1
you understand harry: 1
widened something of: 1
wrenched his gaze: 1
it in principle: 1
name written on: 1
the phoenix that: 1
shopping she'd been: 1
at her side: 1
of golden fire: 1
lips seemed less: 1
about the political: 1
had been you: 1
the will of: 1
his chair and: 1
sickle into that: 1
around the bend: 1
then harry listen: 1
back straightened only: 1
to help them: 1
out the door: 1
about this later: 1
brother from reading: 1
some cunning countermeasure: 1
a formal nod: 1
muggle artifact to: 1
fatigue show the: 1
does not tell: 1
masters can you: 1
own father died: 1
me stay over: 1
to you son: 1
saying er said: 1
fawkes no said: 1

it then harry: 1
could not appreciate: 1
him that message: 1
died in azkaban: 1
would have lost: 1
trying to do: 1
expect you've heard: 1
nodded and said: 1
misunderstood what professor: 1
am saying to: 1
mind the bright: 1
door opened and: 1
a margaret bulstrode: 1
recognize the book: 1
understood fawkes without: 1
look in his: 1
like messing with: 1
i'll go with: 1
destroy that many: 1
same time as: 1
reason and a: 1
had a feeling: 1
and learning from: 1
not before realized: 1
anyone invisible harry: 1
calm expression and: 1
his shirt and: 1
and take the: 1
are good but: 1
fire at the: 1
phoenix's wings flapped: 1
chair and gave: 1
seated himself on: 1
gaze from the: 1
rise as strong: 1
time without hurting: 1
wiser here at: 1
hat occupied their: 1
survived each one: 1
all of it: 1
face to match: 1
fallen into slavery: 1
harry not exactly: 1
cryptography first harry: 1
toward the door: 1
and kept the: 1
phoenixes are wiser: 1
that fawkes he: 1
through her mind: 1
the floor a: 1
please hear me: 1
dumbledore my own: 1
where the scowling: 1
have raged and: 1
i have taught: 1
had screamed at: 1
he is no: 1
well he wouldn't: 1
harry used the: 1
to the door-handle: 1
and perhaps wiser: 1
wearing that same: 1
not running thankfully: 1

back up to: 1
as harry stumped: 1
starving students always: 1
it i thought: 1
himself just expecting: 1
i was adopted: 1
lily's sister petunia: 1

led him to: 1
she was probably: 1
family it would: 1
universe surely a: 1
one owns the: 1
who taught biochemistry: 1
confused to stop: 1
dad will admit: 1
that caught his: 1
rubbed his forehead: 1
magic would come: 1
harry climbed the: 1
would end if: 1
being insane in: 1
it's true we: 1

according to mum: 1
he opened his: 1
a professor from: 1

of lined paper: 1
six shelves going: 1
in on it: 1

his envelope just: 1
there is a: 1
yourself as a: 1
send a letter: 1
with hardcover books: 1
the world would: 1
firmly hoping against: 1
do you want: 1

ascending order of: 1
formerly lily evans: 1
a really silly: 1
put here to: 1
certainty in harry: 1
showed us some: 1
and started writing: 1
and a handle: 1
h potter you: 1
odd was going: 1
i got a: 1
the professor really: 1
repeated she looked: 1
his desk and: 1
may concern i: 1
taught biochemistry at: 1
the peculiar certainty: 1
of those arguments: 1
kept on reading: 1
really comes down: 1
it was dangerous: 1
thing ever and: 1
excuses in advance: 1
dear i can't: 1
- i told: 1
said sharply they: 1
say that rationality: 1
this - she: 1
in front of: 1
this particular case: 1
it occur to: 1
got here somehow: 1
then you don't: 1
father i want: 1
went the rationalist's: 1
you sent a: 1
than what dad: 1
scientific method even: 1
to own a: 1
his eyes briefly: 1
they didn't just: 1
see profile click: 1

is a letter: 1
revulsion at the: 1
the neighboring fence: 1
rather suspicious sort: 1
genetic parents james: 1

to obtain any: 1
and lily would: 1
book of higher: 1
weight while you: 1
were talking to: 1
where to find: 1
thing was he: 1
harry directed the: 1
and make up: 1
the living-room table: 1
not realize how: 1
or two-by-fours so: 1
then lily evans: 1
particular case he: 1
go test it: 1
old woman's face: 1
at him dismissive: 1
that he was: 1

he was also: 1
that didn't put: 1
has six shelves: 1
love i know: 1
chapter 5 if: 1
or maybe lily: 1
low-prestige belief well: 1
have to trust: 1
learned what her: 1
i get an: 1
is the most: 1
that some part: 1
little conspiracy was: 1
hardly sometimes harry: 1
she knows about: 1
she was serious: 1
by experiment instead: 1
see if an: 1
to the best: 1
you were ill: 1
you would listen: 1
then she got: 1
shouted into the: 1
gave in she: 1
offhand of where: 1
he was the: 1
a fraction of: 1
also a technique: 1
and then she: 1
look like they: 1
known laws of: 1
i said i: 1
him and smiled: 1
least i could: 1
that you can: 1
get convinced ah: 1
magic is just: 1
shrugged took a: 1
i send an: 1
book-style pdf version: 1
better than most: 1
even if harry: 1
his whole face: 1
that magic on: 1
like that a: 1
i was sick: 1
real science but: 1
know i think: 1
my owl by: 1
asked a bemused: 1
course harry said: 1
actually came out: 1
in order to: 1
glints a tiny: 1
of yellowish parchment: 1
ever seen any: 1
looked at harry: 1
this argument with: 1
do i believe: 1
be true do: 1
my mother petunia: 1
behind him and: 1
extremely interested in: 1
petunia repeated i: 1
to fight too: 1
rolled his eyes: 1
from his desk: 1
had ever seen: 1
harry pulled down: 1
when lily got: 1
was finding himself: 1
centaur told her: 1
and she can't: 1
- she gestured: 1
lily did this: 1
explain why petunia: 1
at answering that: 1
himself this is: 1
myself what kind: 1
just expressing instinctive: 1
dad's side no: 1
i can't think: 1
knows and trigger: 1
was in the: 1
scary as arguments: 1
a ten-year-old seriously: 1
door behind him: 1
do it by: 1
only my mother: 1
unscientific thing there: 1
treated their own: 1
suspicious sort of: 1
her husband i: 1
her in the: 1
own backyard was: 1
your father i: 1
just wave it: 1
harry froze in: 1
if he was: 1
probably put here: 1
hogwarts while holding: 1
michael verres-evans and: 1
could do this: 1
he ought to: 1
order of awfulness: 1
minerva mcgonagall harry: 1
to be on: 1
both of them: 1
they'd forgotten there: 1
you're not familiar: 1
resolve things just: 1
because of that: 1
each other but: 1
his tone indicated: 1
harry closed his: 1
matter what my: 1
like that except: 1
a place actually: 1
mother petunia says: 1
wasn't making excuses: 1
husband to to: 1
his wife mrs: 1
me in college: 1
but it's true: 1

to demonstrate to: 1
a wand and: 1
widely considered to: 1
anything that violated: 1
- wasn't making: 1
of paperback science: 1
reading of course: 1
here to watch: 1
to my sister: 1
he was given: 1
on fighting while: 1
from hogwarts they: 1
true i've seen: 1
don't like it: 1
character of physical: 1
father feel guilty: 1
a wrinkled arm: 1
table and an: 1
you're only ten: 1
petunia said her: 1
said his father: 1

serious my sister: 1
it's an ideal: 1
there's a quote: 1

pretty too even: 1
indicated that he: 1
i drank this: 1

me and i: 1
safe enough it: 1
an owl picks: 1
in a strangled: 1

harry said firmly: 1
to michael he: 1
to to listen: 1
he addressed to: 1
to myself what: 1
are speaking sharply: 1
science but please: 1
said mrs figg: 1
if she didn't: 1
plenty of science: 1

after chapter 10: 1
harry shrugged took: 1

every inch of: 1
that only stupid: 1
envelope which he: 1
looking shocked i: 1
and kept on: 1
his father shook: 1
his attention bought: 1
ideal of science: 1
- it wasn't: 1

why there wouldn't: 1
rationality to notice: 1
the universe that: 1
then they went: 1
explain how it: 1
easy it is: 1
and it is: 1

and dieting i: 1

ran on perfectly: 1
concern i recently: 1
unnerving silence i'm: 1
out with this: 1
an argument with: 1
what his brain: 1
letter got here: 1
final arbiter is: 1
put it in: 1
associating himself with: 1
itself just didn't: 1
them stopped and: 1
somehow much worse: 1
double-edged beneath the: 1
question but in: 1
of excuse and: 1
there's no way: 1
into the air: 1
neighbors harry pulled: 1
would come out: 1
to the ceiling: 1

was one case: 1
my husband to: 1
mother was in: 1
gave over his: 1
brain seems to: 1
that if she: 1
it with style: 1
science competitions he: 1
voice you know: 1
i learned what: 1
and if not: 1
herself that would: 1
the known laws: 1
under the windows: 1
thought at his: 1
arguments - his: 1
if harry tried: 1
a magic owl: 1
harry said if: 1
the books that: 1
science mentioned is: 1
poor dear i: 1
harry said in: 1
out the back: 1
whole magical world: 1
sounded highly suspicious: 1
pretty embarrassing now: 1
his voice trembled: 1
soon enough how: 1
the funny thing: 1
felt and i: 1
backyard was actually: 1
was actually pretty: 1
i can't win: 1
when you were: 1
little heaps under: 1
his mind that: 1
out in liters: 1

bitterly he was: 1
i didn't care: 1
mcgonagall harry wrote: 1
much about it: 1
lily potter then: 1
it says less: 1
no petunia said: 1
answering that question: 1
little off my: 1
slim form lily: 1
rowling owns harry: 1
bend spoons if: 1
with style then: 1
what i believe: 1
father's favorite dishes: 1
matter-of-factly she was: 1
ten-year-old seriously hardly: 1
been encouraged to: 1
joking lying or: 1
and i'd been: 1
going to test: 1
experiment instead of: 1
a whole magical: 1
two of the: 1
once they would: 1
harry just stood: 1
stairs to his: 1
i wasn't -: 1
layers of paperback: 1
settle things by: 1
little anticipation harry: 1
please keep in: 1
wizardry harry rubbed: 1
recently received your: 1
on it too: 1
and the sofas: 1
where do you: 1
to obtain a: 1
his father went: 1
brain why do: 1
have an owl: 1
it comes out: 1
presume help lily: 1
think went the: 1
kitchen sink to: 1
a trained magician: 1
and looked down: 1
obtain a candle: 1
when i learned: 1
owl by july: 1
with the skeptical: 1
bit her lip: 1
gestured at her: 1
it is all: 1
come down and: 1
should've sounded highly: 1
your favorite thing: 1
dursley he was: 1
tried exercising and: 1
kitchen preparing one: 1
of that and: 1
the room harry: 1
i - because: 1
expected it didn't: 1
for hogwarts can: 1
said in a: 1
his door and: 1
if it's true: 1
listen michael i: 1
i was pretty: 1
to know very: 1
and call 'letter: 1
seemed to know: 1
what a good: 1
theory then but: 1
must have been: 1
books above the: 1
prettier than me: 1
occupied by the: 1
part of himself: 1
thing there is: 1
lost weight and: 1
that violated the: 1
they could both: 1
it was drug: 1
wrung her hands: 1
it makes me: 1
version of the: 1
mum dad we'll: 1
the moonlight glints: 1
the letter herself: 1
the professor considers: 1
how easy it: 1
requires and it: 1
airs the man: 1
me so that: 1
bend spoons where: 1
says less wrong: 1
hogwarts he -: 1
a jiffy or: 1
going to go: 1
disappeared from over: 1
when you say: 1
this called for: 1
nice to me: 1
pretty she'd always: 1
place the part: 1
could diet and: 1
couldn't lose weight: 1
- they visited: 1
but please keep: 1
was a third: 1
top of its: 1
hypothesis is to: 1
she gave in: 1
we'll know soon: 1
to him if: 1
she got magic: 1
be not arguing: 1
annoyance was creeping: 1
only stupid people: 1
above the books: 1
not arguing was: 1
sometimes harry wanted: 1
into one of: 1
of witchcraft and: 1
don't know where: 1
i also don't: 1
it is for: 1
sharply they were: 1
was utterly convinced: 1
them just trying: 1
can see the: 1
warnings page warnings: 1
drank this potion: 1
quote there about: 1
letter herself that: 1
didn't predict for: 1
art tv tropes: 1
me dear said: 1
didn't just send: 1
mum the two: 1
side no one: 1
a little off: 1
- i don't: 1
fic all science: 1
of parent names: 1
h j p: 1
- always like: 1
harry said his: 1
very very odd: 1
it petunia michael: 1
will and shouted: 1
skeptical airs the: 1
father went so: 1
money his whole: 1
acceptance letter from: 1
than dad i: 1
magic still this: 1
after that i: 1
froze in place: 1
make up the: 1
letter lying on: 1
stupid people believed: 1
an unstamped envelope: 1
line black robes: 1
- because i: 1
professor here and: 1
his mother was: 1
him and trust: 1
or unmotivated conspiracies: 1
by arguing the: 1
that yes a: 1
the scientific method: 1
help lily obtain: 1
of the books: 1
or the professor: 1
of his father's: 1
tutors from the: 1
about rationality probably: 1
james potter-evans-verres there: 1
such a place: 1
that his first: 1
about this mum: 1
just - petunia: 1
this was one: 1
her sister or: 1
that it's true: 1
arm stretched out: 1
that ran on: 1
argument with dad: 1
other shelves have: 1
magical world out: 1
secret more magic: 1
take this seriously: 1
enough books are: 1
on the living-room: 1
about it i: 1
father was sitting: 1
lectures on physics: 1
what you see: 1
sitting in the: 1
always guess what: 1
this bizarre certainty: 1
imagine what someone: 1
in place the: 1
stumped out the: 1
despite his father's: 1
envelope high in: 1
and i just: 1
a flat metal: 1
father the professor: 1
i really have: 1
that way only: 1
funny thing was: 1
over and the: 1
it and when: 1
parent names their: 1
- petunia michael: 1
his mechanical pencil: 1
that didn't work: 1
was adopted by: 1
far as to: 1
parents were getting: 1
sister or a: 1
just graduated i: 1
at least i: 1
of the author: 1
come now harry: 1
what kind of: 1
pops into your: 1
reasonable that he: 1
in liters and: 1
i hated her: 1
to his wife: 1
if you could: 1
his father feel: 1
another this called: 1
as more of: 1
then mum will: 1
tears my love: 1
is real science: 1
sort of excuse: 1
harry thought to: 1
know that can't: 1
each bookcase has: 1
revulsion should have: 1
my room harry: 1
the initials h: 1
interested in attending: 1
- harry closed: 1
figg the occasional: 1
trembled a little: 1
cleared up and: 1
to be fat: 1
this madness he: 1
convinced that magic: 1
the skeptical part: 1
have really hit: 1
letter a wrinkled: 1
i know i: 1
i taught harry: 1
lily evans in: 1
said he wanted: 1
was pretty people: 1
what her magic: 1
drug money his: 1
much worse mum: 1
dad about it: 1
of higher math: 1
picks it up: 1
where his mother: 1
insanity or unmotivated: 1
- despite his: 1
the air in: 1
to her sister: 1
head but this: 1
to study whatever: 1
adopted son harry: 1
over his envelope: 1
bookcase each bookcase: 1
as a good: 1
this for my: 1
got a letter: 1
around outside and: 1
from her hairnet: 1
with the back: 1
wax onto the: 1
harry didn't think: 1
it by the: 1
that but it: 1
little please try: 1
that he thought: 1
you were thinking: 1
potter in emerald-green: 1
in college and: 1
sister petunia evans-verres: 1
was sitting in: 1
face disappeared from: 1
millimeters of graphite: 1
tiny fragment of: 1
on physics there's: 1
lily evans are: 1
was no denying: 1
he showed us: 1
that she was: 1
to learn everything: 1
book of the: 1
philosophers say a: 1
an owl to: 1
your theory then: 1
inch of wall: 1
lip i can't: 1
mean to her: 1
have been an: 1
know petunia whispered: 1
that if an: 1
send an owl: 1
probably better than: 1
about how philosophers: 1
in the end: 1
ceiling some bookshelves: 1
to the brim: 1
they visited for: 1
the professor would: 1
which he addressed: 1
of books above: 1
be uncivilized you're: 1
from above the: 1
directed the thought: 1
sick for a: 1
really have to: 1
no one in: 1
learn everything the: 1
lily convinced you: 1
to - the: 1
to fight over: 1
stare at him: 1
the characters may: 1
said firmly hoping: 1
obtain any of: 1
and he was: 1
well the letter: 1
occasional babysitter what: 1
ridiculous things and: 1
of awfulness if: 1
this envelope i'm: 1
well probably better: 1
at the sky: 1
the house occupied: 1
think the funny: 1
whatever math or: 1
about how it's: 1
things by experiment: 1
up on old: 1
reflection led him: 1
dad mum the: 1
an expectant hand: 1
be extremely helpful: 1
not a strict: 1
obtain her school: 1
out he was: 1
it arrived at: 1
wasn't so hungry: 1
professor who taught: 1
highly skeptical i: 1
version fan art: 1
thinking harry shrugged: 1
was creeping into: 1
happen can it: 1
silver a fraction: 1
have to explain: 1
have worries a: 1
her lip i: 1
able to bend: 1
they say they: 1
and looked at: 1
hate my sister: 1
and according to: 1
advance for why: 1
to look at: 1
hogwarts can i: 1
begged her for: 1
harry was utterly: 1
rule in science: 1
me her voice: 1
letterbox without a: 1
have to own: 1
her school materials: 1
readers this is: 1
arguments could be: 1
out even further: 1
hand hardly even: 1
do i really: 1
of your own: 1
how philosophers say: 1
letter - harry: 1
listen to the: 1
to normal it: 1
i can't just: 1
on reading of: 1
gathering in petunia's: 1
father's skeptical airs: 1
of science the: 1
owl picks it: 1
actually seemed to: 1
dad look in: 1
but take a: 1
of me and: 1
might have just: 1
good at answering: 1
that a secret: 1
things just by: 1
effect she was: 1
do it but: 1
i'll just wave: 1
but the peculiar: 1
your theory how: 1
bookcase has six: 1
provided with tutors: 1
unmotivated conspiracies that: 1
e v if: 1
about magic and: 1
but in this: 1
entered he was: 1
with shame an: 1
books are overflowing: 1
the air he: 1
it was awful: 1
whatever caught his: 1
his wife are: 1
envelope of yellowish: 1
professor rolled his: 1
it after chapter: 1
i can't imagine: 1
mcgonagall or whomsoever: 1
his mother gave: 1
he couldn't seem: 1
other but they: 1
untrustworthy or dangerously: 1
another few millimeters: 1
believe what i: 1
i'm better than: 1
anticipation harry directed: 1
an envelope high: 1
sofas and making: 1
and drip wax: 1
said so i'll: 1
little insanity was: 1
called for careful: 1
at the world: 1
owl here harry: 1
of the neighbors: 1
it's true and: 1
hogwarts professor would: 1
science that didn't: 1
a minute that: 1
considers shouting to: 1
just hopeless now: 1
don't know i: 1
that didn't get: 1
from the endless: 1
the truth i'm: 1
mum there was: 1
in a jiffy: 1
course that's what: 1
and lily potter: 1
physics there's a: 1
babysitter what are: 1
your letter of: 1
instead of violence: 1
without a stamp: 1
of the world: 1
truth i'm going: 1
if it seemed: 1
end - petunia: 1
of tears my: 1
i don't want: 1
i myself am: 1
we can just: 1
a letter from: 1
and hid the: 1
the letterbox without: 1
minutely and kept: 1
rose back up: 1
in emerald-green ink: 1
to one another: 1
son would be: 1
make his father: 1
how did they: 1
harry announced his: 1
also don't know: 1
but - her: 1
was and his: 1
to fake the: 1
spoons - what: 1
demonstrate to her: 1
disgraceful thing that: 1
own a magic: 1
heavier and lily: 1
the face disappeared: 1
can't win arguments: 1
understanding of the: 1
try not to: 1
her voice small: 1
surely a little: 1
since the instant: 1
utterly convinced that: 1
to my room: 1
reading a book: 1
into this madness: 1
to him that: 1
then folded up: 1
her for years: 1
feel not-confused there: 1
magic did they: 1
her slim form: 1
petunia's eyes flicked: 1
be expected to: 1
so if you: 1
treated well probably: 1
be a professor: 1
every fool thought: 1
the tables and: 1
that he still: 1
affords pulling and: 1
do this for: 1
initials h j: 1
hit its stride: 1
potter and lily: 1
the author not: 1
how it arrived: 1
strange little anticipation: 1
out right of: 1
dear said mrs: 1
saw the putative: 1
lesson in wisdom: 1
called cold reading: 1
telling dad about: 1
even further well: 1
it was also: 1
be named dudley: 1
that you sent: 1
is all wrong: 1
in wisdom and: 1
the brim with: 1
theory how do: 1
worse mum harry: 1
for that to: 1
some part of: 1
have to resolve: 1
she were nice: 1
for careful calligraphy: 1
about it but: 1
of wall space: 1
letter mother mentioned: 1
even if it: 1
character knows and: 1
ever and read: 1
didn't get done: 1
his voice you: 1
then petunia bit: 1
a lesson in: 1
seen things -: 1
on harry looked: 1
they were at: 1
of the proverb: 1
hogwarts ' and: 1
been thinking sending: 1
regular mathematical rules: 1
then no one: 1
in harry seemed: 1
potter-evans-verres there is: 1
did it occur: 1
whispered but it's: 1
tone indicated that: 1
their current address: 1
professor michael verres-evans: 1
pretty people were: 1
anyone keep something: 1
eyes briefly hopeless: 1
to me her: 1
evans-verres and their: 1
was it then: 1
out the strange: 1
month but when: 1
closed his eyes: 1
better i wasn't: 1
the low-prestige belief: 1
himself magic was: 1
not then mum: 1
that's called cold: 1
her i used: 1
you could diet: 1
and advice offered: 1
shut the door: 1
envelope just leave: 1
was just expressing: 1
seriously hardly sometimes: 1
mother turned from: 1
any more and: 1
the methods of: 1
expressing instinctive revulsion: 1
his will and: 1
there about how: 1
my father is: 1
was pretty she'd: 1
his mother feel: 1
proverb don't go: 1
evidence of magic: 1
she gestured at: 1
voice broke and: 1
magic itself just: 1
lungs she's in: 1
more and i: 1
i - i: 1
and in a: 1
you you'll think: 1
- but you: 1
him feel not-confused: 1
perfectly regular mathematical: 1
but - well: 1
hogwarts further reflection: 1
the universe surely: 1
mother looked down: 1
owl really comes: 1
didn't make the: 1
i presume help: 1
of physical law: 1
stood there stunned: 1
that to happen: 1
test your theory: 1
his mother turned: 1
of him noted: 1
interested in finding: 1
please try not: 1
science the views: 1
thing that only: 1
grey hair escaping: 1
michael he showed: 1
james potter and: 1
neighboring fence grizzled: 1
eyes petunia i: 1
pushing and a: 1
5 if you: 1
his mother looked: 1
except maybe the: 1
back door into: 1
stand it and: 1
went on fighting: 1
it no matter: 1
convinced was screaming: 1
not be aware: 1
told me it: 1
been an open-and-shut: 1
up at the: 1
neck out even: 1
can just get: 1
hid the envelope: 1
a third person: 1
they could always: 1
know very little: 1
was sick for: 1
the standard letter: 1
he saw the: 1
by the eminent: 1
got better i: 1
old tissue boxes: 1
of the first: 1
his father's skeptical: 1
violence or violent: 1
michael said to: 1
mentioned is real: 1
pretty good at: 1
keep in mind: 1
off my understanding: 1
you would do: 1
- that can't: 1
took a piece: 1
better than dad: 1
but stood her: 1
don't want to: 1
weren't to know: 1
care any more: 1
and magic would: 1
convinced ah petunia: 1
math history and: 1
stop and say: 1
- the professor: 1
him that if: 1
added their current: 1
it's true i've: 1
husband was a: 1

i felt and: 1
frightened but stood: 1
third person in: 1
this potion and: 1
a disgraceful thing: 1

harry as though: 1
ah petunia said: 1
really hit its: 1
harry how to: 1
be able to: 1
even if you're: 1
parents james potter: 1
over this harry: 1
with a testable: 1
hungry all the: 1
professor really understood: 1
a little insanity: 1
observation - that: 1
reveal the truth: 1
a letter lying: 1
two i'll have: 1
a professor or: 1
wasn't convinced was: 1
hardly be expected: 1
and i said: 1
is a lesson: 1
his tongue unfroze: 1
still this was: 1
kiss and then: 1
stretching out in: 1
her hands she: 1
like this -: 1
kept getting heavier: 1
i recently received: 1
itself against falsification: 1
address then folded: 1
raised the envelope: 1
i couldn't have: 1
silence i'm going: 1
against falsification -: 1
expected to listen: 1
to come watch: 1
tenured professor who: 1
i believe usually: 1
professor and his: 1
a word every: 1
finding himself just: 1
sent a professor: 1
door affords pushing: 1
said if you: 1
and reading a: 1
boy who would: 1
face was hot: 1
tell you you'll: 1
me feel stupid: 1
stare at her: 1
petunia repeated she: 1
thought to himself: 1
by july 31st: 1
arrived at the: 1
the hypothesis or: 1
careful calligraphy dear: 1
some readers this: 1
one of his: 1
would explain how: 1
sent the letter: 1
highly suspicious oh: 1
turned from the: 1
not shouting the: 1
that pops into: 1
math to show: 1
twisted bitterly he: 1
her not to: 1
oh come now: 1
- his mother: 1
caught his fancy: 1
couldn't stand it: 1
and tried to: 1
flicked to michael: 1
an envelope which: 1
he thought about: 1
her just this: 1
really magic when: 1
son harry james: 1
books in front: 1
or science competitions: 1
was thinking harry: 1
a bemused woman's: 1
more matter-of-factly she: 1
its stride starting: 1
that's what the: 1
dudley dursley it: 1
professor considers shouting: 1
of the universe: 1
it herself my: 1
the two of: 1
saw it petunia: 1
ground her husband: 1
and when that: 1
characters may be: 1
starved myself and: 1
putative letter from: 1
man actually seemed: 1
lily was pretty: 1
skeptical part of: 1
the most improbable: 1
penknife's tip he: 1
really silly theory: 1
envelope into which: 1
of rationality to: 1
hair escaping from: 1
thought about it: 1
fragment of silver: 1
always harry had: 1
eyes and lily: 1
were getting into: 1
denying that something: 1
maybe the slightest: 1
first son would: 1
years i begged: 1
skeptical i myself: 1
this once -: 1
their own children: 1
to me dear: 1
place actually existing: 1
rationality this fic: 1
the only boy: 1
method is for: 1
minerva mcgonagall or: 1
that rationality is: 1
that you're not: 1
for hogwarts while: 1
why do i: 1
understand that you're: 1
one in your: 1
on old tissue: 1
the man actually: 1
at the word: 1
you think went: 1
said looking puzzled: 1
figg and in: 1
what dad thinks: 1
actually pretty embarrassing: 1
an owl here: 1
got her letter: 1
go believing every: 1
considered to have: 1
of graphite from: 1
the letter he: 1
his father tried: 1
less wrong above: 1
the proverb don't: 1
dangerously double-edged beneath: 1
of silver a: 1
the fence and: 1
him and tried: 1
the feynman lectures: 1
with the low-prestige: 1
should have been: 1
those of the: 1
turned and looked: 1
they want my: 1
usual oh come: 1
voice just -: 1
being tested that: 1
the slightest shred: 1
been mean to: 1
mum your parents: 1
looking puzzled then: 1
door into the: 1
whomsoever it may: 1
did this because: 1
it was on: 1
true do i: 1
letter of acceptance: 1
weight and my: 1
arguing the professor: 1
harry seemed willing: 1
his father's instinctive: 1
just by arguing: 1
plate on a: 1
two of them: 1
sky letter for: 1
this seriously son: 1
said but it: 1
down and snatch: 1
liters and someone: 1
one case where: 1
mother mentioned that: 1
professor or the: 1
shook his head: 1
out over the: 1
at this point: 1
main character knows: 1
sink to stare: 1
wasn't - always: 1
wrong because the: 1
her family that: 1
did i couldn't: 1
swallowed listen michael: 1
show how smart: 1
you able to: 1
convinced you that: 1
living-room and reading: 1
and report what: 1
strange certainty was: 1
seriously son even: 1
now his parents: 1
she was a: 1
remember how i: 1
bending spoons -: 1
trying to win: 1
single-point-of-departure fic all: 1
so that we: 1
swallowed calling out: 1
only as harry: 1
i couldn't stand: 1
whispered croak harry: 1
tears were gathering: 1
she didn't help: 1
to stop and: 1
in petunia's eyes: 1
in this particular: 1
harry stumped out: 1
hogwarts his mother: 1
out in front: 1
shelves going almost: 1
something like that: 1
how it's an: 1
hadn't seen anything: 1
i starved myself: 1
stunned that was: 1
he - petunia's: 1
and my skin: 1
extremely helpful sincerely: 1
someone screams a: 1
trust her just: 1
her to use: 1
use it herself: 1
that can't be: 1
insanity was far: 1
isn't enough books: 1
all the time: 1
this point harry: 1
more of a: 1
seemingly impossible remember: 1
begged her to: 1
there was no: 1
work out he: 1
and i wrote: 1
michael verres-evans i: 1
that made you: 1
opened an expectant: 1
right of course: 1
deep breath and: 1
holding an envelope: 1
and began laughing: 1
to resolve things: 1
use the scientific: 1
my brain seems: 1
harry really magic: 1
him if it's: 1
our wedding -: 1
wisdom and advice: 1
lot more important: 1
actually existing only: 1
that should've sounded: 1
universe that ran: 1
bemused woman's voice: 1
and after that: 1
fighting while harry: 1
got magic can: 1
tip he impressed: 1
you could do: 1
and grabs this: 1
lily obtain her: 1
have magic did: 1
was going out: 1
to test your: 1
you still don't: 1
dad we'll know: 1
anything reasonable that: 1
and discarded the: 1
it then petunia: 1
too the other: 1
herself my father: 1
potter and no: 1
chapter 10 give: 1
is that the: 1
encouraged to study: 1
mentioned that you: 1
beneath the moonlight: 1
were just hopeless: 1
believed in if: 1
if you still: 1
better than to: 1
if mum had: 1
with dad look: 1
been since the: 1
the other part: 1
hogwarts addressed to: 1
the door behind: 1
been sent to: 1
fence grizzled grey: 1
brim with hardcover: 1
if his father: 1
show how loving: 1
about possible traumatic: 1
happen even if: 1
lily potter formerly: 1
most ridiculous excuses: 1
a great deal: 1
believe usually harry: 1
said her voice: 1
to his bedroom: 1
but it was: 1
best elementary schools: 1
against hope that: 1
to win and: 1
reading - it: 1
michael said sharply: 1
caught his attention: 1
excuse and magic: 1
father's instinctive revulsion: 1
to win this: 1
of where to: 1
sister was a: 1
by a bookcase: 1
fraction of a: 1
yellowish parchment addressed: 1
an old woman's: 1
gave him a: 1
one of the: 1
piece of lined: 1
no i'm better: 1
empty sky letter: 1
the realm of: 1
him looking shocked: 1
professor turned and: 1
that - despite: 1
into the empty: 1
magic owl that: 1
magic at least: 1
hand like it: 1
could both agree: 1
little about rationality: 1
realm of science: 1
potter then lily: 1
strict single-point-of-departure fic: 1
can't think offhand: 1
harry rubbed his: 1
feel stupid both: 1
from hogwarts harry: 1
and told her: 1
boxes or two-by-fours: 1
grizzled grey hair: 1
to guard itself: 1
else other shelves: 1
i don't know: 1
know i can't: 1
fight over this: 1
it still isn't: 1
went back downstairs: 1
stick its neck: 1
so far as: 1
dishes to show: 1
and making little: 1
myself am uncertain: 1
a testable hypothesis: 1
given anything reasonable: 1
and so if: 1
is the living-room: 1
like that but: 1
can't really happen: 1
him to obtain: 1
than me and: 1
everything back to: 1
of them just: 1
things and i: 1
in advance for: 1
improbable day of: 1
done that way: 1
not be those: 1
so that i: 1
forehead grimacing don't: 1
boy vernon dursley: 1
much afraid that: 1
to have some: 1

on dad's side: 1
almost to the: 1
all as scary: 1
see the magic: 1
science is that: 1
is for a: 1
and his father: 1
wanted to scream: 1
said i didn't: 1
bookshelves are stacked: 1
can you imagine: 1
parchment addressed to: 1
says she knows: 1
he wanted except: 1
it but take: 1
was unexpected the: 1

into the unnerving: 1
i couldn't hate: 1
back downstairs his: 1
but when i: 1
he paused tapped: 1
but they are: 1
offered by darker: 1
yes harry's lips: 1
down and grabs: 1
open-and-shut case for: 1
middle of your: 1
he impressed the: 1
about magic when: 1
the time i: 1
woman's face peered: 1
had been encouraged: 1
if i couldn't: 1
or dangerously double-edged: 1
pretty tears were: 1
verge of tears: 1
doing harry nothing: 1

how do i: 1
mother tried to: 1
evans are dead: 1
there was plenty: 1
from over the: 1
but - but: 1
normal it didn't: 1
certainty harry was: 1
was hot with: 1
rationality is your: 1
where to obtain: 1
everything the main: 1

click on where: 1
the professor turned: 1
an owl did: 1
especially when i: 1
it being tested: 1
evans in order: 1
the only rule: 1
wand and magic: 1
for mum joking: 1
blood spills out: 1
harry's mouth twisted: 1
rationality probably his: 1
it actually came: 1
didn't put everything: 1
letter how did: 1
someone must have: 1
certainty was making: 1
they would listen: 1
he was provided: 1
still hadn't seen: 1
i'd been mean: 1
argument with your: 1
one another at: 1
- that you: 1
it up dad: 1
really understood all: 1
that would explain: 1
to think the: 1
eyes flicked to: 1
representative to lily: 1
the hogwarts school: 1
my genetic parents: 1
expecting that yes: 1
windows this is: 1
give up see: 1
of the house: 1
tables and the: 1
one of those: 1
two-by-fours so that: 1
thought you'd know: 1
know where to: 1
preparing one of: 1
his forehead grimacing: 1
to descend into: 1
above the neighboring: 1
didn't look like: 1
books propped up: 1
and i hated: 1
word magic still: 1
parent you would: 1
gently you might: 1
harry wanted to: 1
think i'm -: 1
someone over and: 1
smart he was: 1
petunia whispered but: 1
in chapter two: 1
word every inch: 1
' and see: 1
this because i: 1
what my brain: 1
magic and according: 1
folded up the: 1
they are not: 1
the flap of: 1
study whatever caught: 1
some bookshelves are: 1
you conceived of: 1
to trust me: 1
be those of: 1
little boy you: 1
wife mrs petunia: 1
world would end: 1
people believed in: 1
my whole future: 1
hated her for: 1
flap of the: 1
even if i: 1
a letter they: 1
that would feel: 1
hands she seemed: 1
face peered out: 1
attending hogwarts conditional: 1
worries a lot: 1
said after his: 1
then but the: 1
to have really: 1
something very very: 1
something about how: 1
world didn't predict: 1
probably his father: 1
the paper for: 1
and see the: 1
that this time: 1
and then they: 1
of a line: 1
aware that my: 1
don't go believing: 1
then he opened: 1
uncertain i also: 1
been on dad's: 1
to go to: 1
desk and started: 1
i lost weight: 1
feels a little: 1
dad i will: 1
a handle on: 1
see um i: 1
win this argument: 1
true and if: 1
weight i tried: 1
have two layers: 1
is observation -: 1
theory - did: 1
looked frightened but: 1
a rather suspicious: 1
peered out from: 1
of rationality this: 1
petunia's eyes and: 1
and someone screams: 1
professor would show: 1
i will use: 1
ten magic is: 1
world out there: 1
of books propped: 1
form lily did: 1
more especially when: 1
at all as: 1
into your head: 1
the endless labor: 1
at him looking: 1
descend into this: 1
he wanted children: 1
slightest shred of: 1
were at our: 1
hogwarts professor here: 1
have to look: 1
the character of: 1
so there's no: 1
genetic fathers treated: 1
he shut the: 1
of the envelope: 1
style then he: 1
sponsored in whatever: 1
you have to: 1
by sudden insanity: 1
you weren't to: 1
of yourself as: 1
heaps under the: 1
emerald-green ink the: 1
stamp a little: 1
belief well there: 1
mouth twisted bitterly: 1
higher math to: 1
paper from his: 1
read so much: 1
thinking at this: 1
harry looked up: 1
the seemingly impossible: 1
outside and call: 1
win and neither: 1
a little conspiracy: 1
it around outside: 1
snatch the letter: 1
hypothesis or even: 1
witchcraft and wizardry: 1
pencil and discarded: 1
is covered by: 1
conspiracies that didn't: 1
instinctive revulsion should: 1
mrs figg and: 1
his father the: 1
still isn't enough: 1
fence and opened: 1
he still hadn't: 1
its neck out: 1
i want my: 1
i tried exercising: 1
harry said but: 1
like i saw: 1
like a rather: 1
me on this: 1
real and had: 1
father mum harry: 1
insane in ascending: 1
experimental method is: 1
harry potter and: 1
history and everything: 1
afraid that she: 1
of his parents: 1
tapped another few: 1
noted much more: 1
and had been: 1
the fence harry: 1
them you weren't: 1
seemed to be: 1
my skin cleared: 1
his bedroom he: 1
how to bend: 1
your head but: 1
other part of: 1
keep something like: 1
a technique of: 1
the hypothesis according: 1
me it was: 1
ill or maybe: 1
of science to: 1
would talk to: 1
michael said gently: 1
began laughing he: 1
to find something: 1
i am extremely: 1
us some magic: 1
because i begged: 1
exercising and dieting: 1
the eminent professor: 1
that you could: 1
would do and: 1
it may concern: 1
and say wait: 1
on fire and: 1
and read so: 1
there how could: 1
wanted children and: 1
occur to him: 1
the protagonist does: 1
to settle things: 1
any of the: 1
with the character: 1
feel like associating: 1
she can't use: 1
that question but: 1
this is not: 1
the professor and: 1
now harry really: 1
and put it: 1
was a disgraceful: 1
her hairnet mrs: 1
his mother tried: 1
getting into one: 1
he said he: 1
been prettier than: 1
was a wizard: 1
magic for ourselves: 1
believing every fool: 1
and smiled thank: 1
potter-evans-verres harry added: 1
person in the: 1
the advice of: 1
door and went: 1
advice offered by: 1
in the kitchen: 1
she swallowed listen: 1
what someone must: 1
everything you think: 1
harry was pretty: 1
can i get: 1
with you but: 1
husband michael verres-evans: 1
to watch you: 1
harry added their: 1
hoping against hope: 1
out as more: 1
false that's what: 1
literature you may: 1
favorite thing ever: 1
if it makes: 1
only ten magic: 1
think offhand of: 1
harry gave over: 1
any more especially: 1
up to stare: 1
me i'd rather: 1
vernon dursley he: 1
endless labor pool: 1
calling out letter: 1
to your theory: 1
neither much interested: 1
a book of: 1
it in an: 1
around chapter 5: 1
and no one: 1
as to test: 1
knows about magic: 1
page how to: 1
harry wrote he: 1
not familiar with: 1
that beyond the: 1
of the characters: 1
james potter-evans-verres harry: 1
ridiculous excuses like: 1
have to fight: 1
what was it: 1
making excuses in: 1
- well -: 1
most unscientific thing: 1
i wasn't so: 1
loves him and: 1
it's false that's: 1
or whomsoever it: 1
some of that: 1
fence harry just: 1
and an unstamped: 1
usually harry was: 1
was a whole: 1
woman's voice one: 1
be fat it: 1
said the annoyance: 1
petunia says she: 1
is your favorite: 1
page warnings about: 1
two layers of: 1
his father and: 1
beyond the realm: 1
sister any more: 1
if not then: 1
day of my: 1
or being insane: 1
michael i wasn't: 1

fit in with: 1
on where it: 1
a hogwarts representative: 1
like it after: 1

a little please: 1
i got better: 1
- and when: 1
conspiracy at the: 1
jiffy or two: 1
potion and i: 1
wall space is: 1
harry asked a: 1
was awful no: 1
breath and raised: 1
back like it: 1
father and his: 1
the back door: 1
you doing harry: 1
visited for christmas: 1
thought that pops: 1
for years i: 1
would only be: 1
nothing harry said: 1
i'm - she: 1
they sent a: 1
associations for some: 1
skin cleared up: 1
seem to help: 1
started writing a: 1
tv tropes page: 1
come from strange: 1
equipment listed in: 1
mrs figg the: 1
was treated well: 1
day's events by: 1
- testing a: 1
most genetic fathers: 1
received your letter: 1
lily got her: 1
the putative letter: 1
an owl really: 1
paper for another: 1
did they get: 1
get an owl: 1
way only as: 1
knew about magic: 1
enough it ought: 1
too even if: 1
with this boy: 1
seen anything that: 1
arguing was somehow: 1
noted that he: 1
making little heaps: 1
so i'll just: 1
one where his: 1
very little about: 1
- petunia stopped: 1
forgotten there was: 1
the sky and: 1
lily would tell: 1
the most unscientific: 1
bought all the: 1
but you don't: 1
she'd always been: 1
just trying to: 1
it was like: 1
it to me: 1
her for it: 1
came out as: 1
if you conceived: 1
am extremely interested: 1
and opened an: 1
college and he: 1
the experimental method: 1
at around chapter: 1
to notice when: 1
i just kept: 1
hardly even thinking: 1
dismissive as usual: 1
as though they'd: 1
is harry's mouth: 1
don't have an: 1
both of his: 1
dad do you: 1
space is covered: 1
him dismissive as: 1
she looked frightened: 1

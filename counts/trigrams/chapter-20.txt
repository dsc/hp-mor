his face and: 2
that they both: 2
professor quirrell his: 2
had ever seen: 2
quirrell looked at: 2
the defense professor: 2
occurred to him: 2
your oath never: 2
you did not: 2
mr potter professor: 2
to be the: 2
saw that professor: 2
professor quirrell harry: 2
to gain the: 2
it harry said: 2
left without a: 2
fifty-one points for: 2
a part of: 2
it is barely: 2
of the dais: 2
to tell you: 2
a single lesson: 2
harry said immediately: 2
said after a: 2
quirrell said after: 2
wrong with me: 2
his head no: 2
wanted to hurt: 2
never to speak: 2
a lot of: 2
professor quirrell he: 2
for fifteen minutes: 2
you don't like: 2
harry looked at: 2
yourself in my: 2
to speak of: 2
you professor quirrell: 2
you have not: 2
while i suppose: 2
after a while: 2
professor quirrell looked: 2
i thought that: 2
which might have: 2
old wizard said: 2
mr potter the: 2
they have had: 2
want to hurt: 2
sorry harry said: 2
as a dark: 2
that people you: 2
to move me: 2
at professor quirrell: 2
professor quirrell now: 2
quirrell said again: 2
silent for a: 2
his voice had: 2
then harry realized: 2
he hadn't tried: 2
said immediately see: 2
professor quirrell's voice: 2
in the midst: 2
about to say: 2
occurred to harry: 2
wanted to talk: 2
in a voice: 2
that if you: 2
quirrell was silent: 2
they want to: 2
power to move: 2
had never occurred: 2
professor quirrell blinked: 2
to hurt those: 2
convince you to: 2
needs to be: 2
that impulse is: 2
such things and: 2
might have been: 2
to convince me: 2
on his desk: 2
if you use: 2
thank you for: 2
professor quirrell's face: 2
long long time: 2
a scientist professor: 2
being a dark: 2
harry had a: 2
points for ravenclaw: 2
was going to: 2
voice had grown: 2
to professor quirrell: 2
upper hand over: 2
the solar system: 2
mr potter you: 2
would they have: 2
the upper hand: 2
to be trained: 2
mr potter but: 2
professor quirrell it: 2
professor quirrell in: 2
you have it: 2
gain the upper: 2
to be a: 2
oath never to: 2
even if i: 2
shook his head: 2
a feeling of: 2
too much indignation: 2
question said professor: 2
speak of what: 2
was silent for: 2
i have some: 2
should have been: 2
the door and: 2
without a single: 2
the midst of: 2
is barely possible: 2
never occurred to: 2
quirrell shook his: 2
potter the headmaster: 2
think that's quite: 2
small circle of: 2
and needs to: 2
so very very: 2
but there was: 2
barely possible that: 2
i'm sorry harry: 2
a long long: 2
that mr potter: 2
professor quirrell there: 2
what harry said: 2
stand up and: 2
professor quirrell shook: 2
and saw that: 2
do to convince: 2
scientist professor quirrell: 2
had a feeling: 2
have it harry: 2
up at the: 2
to talk to: 2
sorting hat would: 2
to convince you: 2
no mr potter: 2
thought that was: 2
the power to: 2
to you professor: 2
want to do: 2
professor quirrell stood: 2
able to gain: 2
blah blah blah: 2
potter professor quirrell: 2
was able to: 2
done for you: 2
you say is: 1
perfect mr potter: 1
people - no: 1
no such method: 1
of him which: 1
to it that: 1
information you couldn't: 1
interstellar space so: 1
as i thought: 1
promise and your: 1
to learn to: 1
eyes over and: 1
out the eager: 1
me down blah: 1
a word of: 1
quirrell leaned on: 1
rubbed the bridge: 1
only wrong one: 1
look only otherwise: 1
it was apparent: 1
grown up with: 1
there is to: 1
but science is: 1
preference utilitarianism pardon: 1
was looking at: 1
for his attackers: 1
humiliated for fifteen: 1
this he had: 1
with a feeling: 1
from - no: 1
but it leaves: 1
parents died because: 1
greatest fighting wizard: 1
the probe but: 1
the stars vanished: 1
on the probes: 1
spoke up i: 1
unusually hateful i: 1
you is as: 1
of them smiled: 1
quirrell said then: 1
into the room: 1
me after that: 1
apparent that dumbledore: 1
a human death: 1
never used those: 1
ambition which the: 1
as dark arts: 1
knock at the: 1
be classified by: 1
for one of: 1
nonetheless improbable that: 1
headmaster mr potter: 1
him somehow even: 1
slowly something strange: 1
he stared at: 1
bulletin which keeps: 1
what would be: 1
was your own: 1
looking at harry: 1
what the sorting: 1
what are you: 1
some simple and: 1
the potions class: 1
light lord i: 1
halt before where: 1
funny how harry's: 1
said solemnly with: 1
in the professor's: 1
must live under: 1
dark lord is: 1
that was exactly: 1
dark lord in: 1
about to tell: 1
tired - i: 1
dark lord if: 1
stood in front: 1
please be discreet: 1
you quirinus your: 1
things and the: 1
seemed a little: 1
where he stood: 1
it end all: 1
determine if professor: 1
me said professor: 1
on anything but: 1
leaning on his: 1
harder on his: 1
that it simply: 1
could do any: 1
was that jinx: 1
a finger i: 1
right thing slowly: 1
harry if you: 1
say in icy: 1
which i am: 1
program harry said: 1
dark side harry: 1
not allow you: 1
hurting himself still: 1
raised his wand: 1
things they want: 1
harbor no ambitions: 1
for everything professor: 1
goal was to: 1
to know where: 1
only otherwise i: 1
fools who discovered: 1
but it's only: 1
if the idea: 1
harry said the: 1
single lesson harry: 1
nodded where he: 1
that the sorting: 1
react mr potter: 1
only just recently: 1
not tomorrow either: 1
that about is: 1
i heard students: 1
decades i cannot: 1
think about this: 1
if you don't: 1
up and feel: 1
sighed and turned: 1
question to ensure: 1
never shutting down: 1
held it behind: 1
short radius around: 1
your oath or: 1
both snape and: 1
himself looking over: 1
but i can: 1
real people who: 1
but maybe you: 1
a high-pitched shriek: 1
expression was still: 1
professor quirrell this: 1
to make her: 1
it harry was: 1
particular focus of: 1
minister of magic: 1
lowered in register: 1
hard to suppress: 1
act on anything: 1
pay for mr: 1
intensity you're a: 1
you do when: 1
an act lies: 1
his desk harry: 1
be interrupted -: 1
mind which make: 1
his attackers on: 1
opened his mouth: 1
though less to: 1
and deliberately harry: 1
dare you like: 1
could just raise: 1
of said harry: 1
something seemed to: 1
things than harry: 1
betrayed in any: 1
looking thoughtful i: 1
on the surface: 1
or you will: 1
off the path: 1
reality because i: 1
it means that: 1
sorting hat tried: 1
when i get: 1
wobbling in sudden: 1
the probes would: 1
marble on which: 1
there are secrets: 1
turn back the: 1
dumbledore was gone: 1
up on it: 1
silence to keep: 1
of the solar: 1
stars it was: 1
cast a spell: 1
was almost shouting: 1
the idea had: 1
there wouldn't be: 1
hard marble floor: 1
mention harry said: 1
don't be said: 1
them but it: 1
up straight instead: 1
it was time: 1
my life without: 1
the confusion lasted: 1
point didn't begin: 1
say that they: 1
then stand up: 1
it harry what: 1
dark side there: 1
just had the: 1
consider you to: 1
tell him afterward: 1
that knowledge to: 1
in my parents: 1
you had a: 1
and i don't: 1
quirrell was looking: 1
reply why not: 1
professor quirrell's expression: 1
to become omnipotent: 1
interrupted - dumbledore: 1
immediately see to: 1
dais so professor: 1
else about that: 1
today said professor: 1
confirm your theory: 1
blah so you're: 1
matter how tired: 1
him i snuck: 1
for today mr: 1
those slytherins has: 1
a hand over: 1
do what they: 1
suddenly sharp a: 1
you must do: 1
desk the headmaster: 1
or your friends: 1
but to stay: 1
explanation is that: 1
with sparkling sprinkles: 1
i was your: 1
the instant you: 1
read because they: 1
thing it had: 1
this story enough: 1
it was clear: 1
passwords would they: 1
a new idea: 1
points will do: 1
informed of progress: 1
almost wasn't there: 1
that thought could: 1
blurring his vision: 1
his expression as: 1
been placed there: 1
the distant arches: 1
harry nodded i'll: 1
as before floating: 1
had done the: 1
yes nuclear weapons: 1
those same books: 1
don't have any: 1
to violate rule: 1
fool either can: 1
first day headmaster: 1
of awareness which: 1
have your word: 1
events of this: 1
were good people: 1
with a cold: 1
actual you know: 1
have just been: 1
going to get: 1
is worthy of: 1
present time would: 1
to notice that: 1
position one which: 1
vanished the walls: 1
lord in the: 1
see said professor: 1
terminal illness snuck: 1
you seem to: 1
was in your: 1
nodded he wasn't: 1
it's right -: 1
mean that a: 1
the night sky: 1
can to help: 1
the boy-who-lived this: 1
in when my: 1
to betray that: 1
a bit tired: 1
my own wish: 1
think i know: 1
been able to: 1
maybe space travel: 1
me i have: 1
earth mr potter: 1
physicist the thought: 1
then harry turned: 1
this school i: 1
potter barked professor: 1
not smart enough: 1
found a volunteer: 1
final compromise was: 1
mr potter barked: 1
said dumbledore he: 1
this is evident: 1
to go about: 1
how to lose: 1
maintained plausible deniability: 1
already doomed in: 1
bypassed awareness and: 1
exactly those things: 1
harry nodded a: 1
in the night: 1
harry approached the: 1
of the starfield: 1
still kept its: 1
the way professor: 1
the answer i: 1
coat doing pointless: 1
would look the: 1
judgment given the: 1
imagined himself looking: 1
not be heard: 1
its usual seriousness: 1
set in a: 1
i ask you: 1
the first part: 1
a voice so: 1
crossed dumbledore's face: 1
front of the: 1
said blankly but: 1
face and when: 1
makes something right: 1
there even if: 1
which make that: 1
eyes i will: 1
take my leave: 1
seeing is my: 1
a thing as: 1
you want to: 1
and when that: 1
you wouldn't think: 1
suppose there was: 1
another part of: 1
students should not: 1
choice for the: 1
exist anyway but: 1
be his tutor: 1
that hand had: 1
fact to be: 1
felt like sacrilege: 1
whether there might: 1
this you can't: 1
any vengeance was: 1
which could take: 1
again dumbledore and: 1
it was enough: 1
a real slytherin: 1
but it is: 1
what's going to: 1
at both of: 1
giant heap of: 1
had been unable: 1
it had ever: 1
endless field of: 1
on impulse had: 1
am not going: 1
anything wrong with: 1
wiping his eyes: 1
an infinite and: 1
whispered it was: 1
the solar plexus: 1
but it refused: 1
in despair without: 1
heard professor quirrell's: 1
is sometimes mistaken: 1
the representativeness heuristic: 1
way i promise: 1
read was a: 1
into ravenclaw mr: 1
about quirinus quirrell: 1
course but science: 1
as to not: 1
expensive as you: 1
heard and understood: 1
and sat down: 1
the part that: 1
obviously harry said: 1
desk harry quickly: 1
when you're trying: 1
dumbledore and professor: 1
more precise then: 1
to know your: 1
cold look was: 1
any threat the: 1
a while i: 1
will do anything: 1
fact professor quirrell: 1
1 point didn't: 1
be wrong if: 1
are too many: 1
can work with: 1
quirrell nodded where: 1
thing he ever: 1
had to follow: 1
sharper you could: 1
himself still too: 1
when that was: 1
drove me to: 1
original question said: 1
didn't bother me: 1
are killed by: 1
with a finger: 1
what have they: 1
favorite person in: 1
much indignation observed: 1
fighting wizard to: 1
but wrong in: 1
may i strongly: 1
stress to notice: 1
i strongly recommend: 1
you sure you: 1
voice had lowered: 1
of superiority other: 1
stood by his: 1
even he-who-must-not-be-named never: 1
say is a: 1
- step one: 1
or - step: 1
a transparent lie: 1
definition of evidence: 1
finally what is: 1
your mind at: 1
sky above no: 1
doomed in some: 1
services you will: 1
was only wrong: 1
also insist that: 1
today mr potter: 1
first place harry: 1
power for evil: 1
yet seen from: 1
you about in: 1
he wouldn't like: 1
said and sat: 1
to focus funny: 1
theory and that: 1
to be even: 1
that a lot: 1
about the way: 1
yes that strange: 1
on future occasions: 1
discover them for: 1
dominance but it's: 1
they put a: 1
it is economical: 1
you mr potter: 1
would say now: 1
you're saying i: 1
out and yanked: 1
quirrell consider me: 1
that no one: 1
the person to: 1
about the fifty-one: 1
or less probable: 1
quirrell was standing: 1
way there is: 1
away it would: 1
harry turned serious: 1
quite what i: 1
was already visible: 1
you were trying: 1
something flickered in: 1
to do and: 1
most probable explanation: 1
sun that harry: 1
tried to convince: 1
i am going: 1
then how can: 1
you forbade any: 1
said smiling they: 1
going but it's: 1
boundaries of the: 1
no need to: 1
wanting to protect: 1
i had no: 1
stared in shock: 1
cheek with a: 1
done i don't: 1
we can only: 1
never predictable times: 1
still too much: 1
until they reported: 1
this man had: 1
my child self: 1
sharp a spell: 1
was a slight: 1
masks actually for: 1
said dryly it's: 1
i looked for: 1
he left without: 1
headmaster that you: 1
it behind my: 1
gets cold everything: 1
what's confusing you: 1
to both harry: 1
laughed but to: 1
of things i: 1
was frowning such: 1
to switch off: 1
is step one: 1
part that wanted: 1
is how you: 1
you and needs: 1
seem to figure: 1
said in a: 1
why not harry: 1
ideas for making: 1
some justification for: 1
will happily lead: 1
room a look: 1
harry as before: 1
like 'right' to: 1
wonder how on: 1
is that dumbledore: 1
into oblivion the: 1
storm out as: 1
nose i don't: 1
confess to wanting: 1
of evidence explained: 1
become a scientist: 1
could come to: 1
just no it: 1
the way and: 1
planets and take: 1
last probable cause: 1
quirrell harry said: 1
that harry was: 1
not ever have: 1
how to cast: 1
the first place: 1
potter if you: 1
into something merely: 1
it that obvious: 1
midst of the: 1
you hurry up: 1
managed a whisper: 1
many legilimens in: 1
you here harry: 1
in what that: 1
would never forget: 1
a portrait of: 1
face that the: 1
you can just: 1
long strides had: 1
nuclear physicists should: 1
how you might: 1
didn't want to: 1
because they thought: 1
powers when it: 1
too at least: 1
i cannot picture: 1
he'd left without: 1
i've been under: 1
quirrell quietly but: 1
potter receive instruction: 1
instant you hear: 1
impulse had i: 1
potter you may: 1
into interstellar space: 1
he didn't want: 1
do not share: 1
to be standing: 1
the boundaries of: 1
lacks the intelligence: 1
has offered you: 1
considering i suppose: 1
discovered the secret: 1
of me while: 1
about abusive professors: 1
probes that would: 1
help as a: 1
not dumb or: 1
given the evidence: 1
him before and: 1
voice so quiet: 1
now looking outright: 1
which can be: 1
which physicists kept: 1
one else knows: 1
the defense position: 1
me well yes: 1
planet before they: 1
physicists kept to: 1
quirrell chuckled not: 1
a minute for: 1
same to him: 1
the starfield the: 1
said harry waited: 1
it felt like: 1
wash of light: 1
about it either: 1
intent to learn: 1
as dignified as: 1
not to fall: 1
if i can't: 1
jewels set in: 1
in fact to: 1
you abused by: 1
surface mr potter: 1
occlumency instructor such: 1
my parental issues: 1
imagine what giant: 1
harry and professor: 1
had some justification: 1
that much in: 1
will end the: 1
favored professor quirrell: 1
self of this: 1
to have said: 1
times to know: 1
lord harry had: 1
bit a math: 1
nothing he had: 1
really just another: 1
instructor such services: 1
fools who can't: 1
wrong but wrong: 1
after a few: 1
muggles can't seem: 1
have not yet: 1
had escaped into: 1
harry nodded puzzled: 1
impress their friends: 1
it to themselves: 1
as a great: 1
suspect you would: 1
should be harry: 1
most terrible dark: 1
he should have: 1
that my parents: 1
hear about the: 1
thought could not: 1
and skittered across: 1
that this man: 1
passed down from: 1
for a time: 1
to cast that: 1
face mr potter: 1
like sacrilege harry: 1
don't tell him: 1
time of no: 1
or minister of: 1
then what was: 1
the stars are: 1
and then the: 1
there when this: 1
to rule over: 1
staring sharply at: 1
dark so without: 1
read as a: 1
probable cause of: 1
that led to: 1
do not touch: 1
will pay for: 1
spell once it: 1
grateful to you: 1
that you try: 1
that lovely golden: 1
on space travel: 1
by different planets: 1
what is your: 1
as if he'd: 1
could not ever: 1
then i think: 1
the moment when: 1
to simply go: 1
play its first: 1
approached the door: 1
spell professor quirrell: 1
potter and i: 1
i discovered that: 1
heavy oaken doors: 1
for a full: 1
difficult to confirm: 1
am feeling a: 1
been still or: 1
a white lab: 1
forget this day: 1
good you're a: 1
like nothing he: 1
this was a: 1
a great surge: 1
things you did: 1
have certain connections: 1
to me and: 1
potter you have: 1
the right thing: 1
alteration for as: 1
to say that: 1
me but that: 1
was teaching him: 1
say that side: 1
are extremely expensive: 1
harry wondered what: 1
said harry or: 1
way to tell: 1
said precisely said: 1
said he tapped: 1
showing where to: 1
out loud it: 1
forgiveness for his: 1
of salazar ask: 1
other cheek with: 1
not miss this: 1
you could've turned: 1
see professor quirrell's: 1
must say that: 1
feeling that he: 1
what thought was: 1
to do once: 1
suppress his expression: 1
the bridge of: 1
i think the: 1
shall achieve my: 1
seen are we: 1
path that led: 1
anyone with the: 1
would take a: 1
starfield the milky: 1
legilimency is sometimes: 1
of each session: 1
harry's face what: 1
sight wrenched at: 1
prefer to maintain: 1
the one project: 1
i bit a: 1
dumbledore's expression changed: 1
perfect blackness an: 1
what giant heap: 1
people exist even: 1
across the now-deserted: 1
list of things: 1
but harry couldn't: 1
to help me: 1
defeat the anti-tampering: 1
about is it: 1
did not wish: 1
the hidden secrets: 1
big fan of: 1
although i do: 1
such a thing: 1
on moral considerations: 1
the most people: 1
mind i must: 1
probably respect him: 1
fine harry whispered: 1
what i wanted: 1
sharper i am: 1
death would certainly: 1
all the time: 1
if i could: 1
do but how: 1
the marble floor: 1
harry off that: 1
what i'm about: 1
quirrell you wanted: 1
away my ball: 1
against the stars: 1
can i consider: 1
i cannot help: 1
learned then the: 1
waiting to talk: 1
grown stronger and: 1
obvious to a: 1
and powerful spell: 1
were times never: 1
study and learn: 1
had earned he: 1
which is too: 1
what was wrong: 1
i couldn't act: 1
but then again: 1
hufflepuff harry said: 1
about something i: 1
either way i'll: 1
current question said: 1
win that day: 1
exist even though: 1
my goal it: 1
because i would: 1
the strangest expressions: 1
want to know: 1
i can raise: 1
trying to convince: 1
muggles seem to: 1
to keep the: 1
no matter how: 1
i cannot seem: 1
the newspapers about: 1
brilliance from some: 1
is your ambition: 1

dumbledore sighed and: 1
nonetheless i shall: 1
been implying i: 1

quirrell it was: 1
eyes he hadn't: 1
all distances incalculable: 1
scientist said professor: 1

by the thought: 1
step one is: 1
open there are: 1
having their star-gazing: 1
to say said: 1
and harry as: 1
long time to: 1
a feeling this: 1
said his voice: 1
me to study: 1
me professor quirrell: 1
my sense of: 1
cannot picture you: 1
we might be: 1
incandescent rage upon: 1
now that was: 1
silence professor quirrell: 1
that hadn't occurred: 1
well yes very: 1
we make our: 1
- and tell: 1

of them the: 1
be the old: 1
have come to: 1
hat would play: 1
cat a scientist: 1
come to me: 1
harry said preference: 1
song but harry: 1
eager little fools: 1
steps um people: 1
which holds those: 1
to science than: 1
imagine it then: 1
of it maybe: 1
word your promise: 1
say 'you win': 1
every possible observation: 1
his desk mr: 1
an existing part: 1
harry's facets were: 1
though i wonder: 1
blurt it out: 1
that doesn't mean: 1
that not that: 1
own desires well: 1
harry imagined himself: 1
and humiliated for: 1
wizard said he: 1
believe this you: 1
and become stronger: 1
then professor mcgonagall: 1
i confess i: 1
time for me: 1
that it's an: 1
forgiveness or was: 1
learned to protect: 1
didn't understand but: 1
had you abused: 1
will do just: 1
before floating in: 1
thought was intriguing: 1
everything important there: 1
stop you from: 1
universe - fool: 1
any super magical: 1
one mr potter: 1
the surface mr: 1
you've wanted to: 1
over a heap: 1
was sorted into: 1
win' seems appropriate: 1
potter will ask: 1
door and found: 1
which was simply: 1
utilitarianism pardon me: 1
parental issues to: 1
get him fired: 1
of harry's facets: 1
possible this time: 1
one which had: 1
wanting to hurt: 1
professor quirrell's snacks: 1
your friend your: 1
the scariest thing: 1
books i read: 1
thing you do: 1
by his desk: 1
straightened up never: 1
you to defend: 1
while i looked: 1
think about anything: 1
quirrell's footsteps moving: 1
blankly but i: 1
much point in: 1
as the part: 1
but harry understood: 1
and graciously forgive: 1
were trying to: 1
it got it: 1
was a weak: 1
me i'm sorry: 1
things i would: 1
the whole list: 1
a particular focus: 1
- intricate confections: 1
moment dumbledore was: 1
that ambition from: 1
his other cheek: 1
quirrell - i: 1
end it end: 1
at harry's face: 1
head no mr: 1
a point of: 1
be discreet about: 1
to understand what: 1
in space the: 1
controlling the universe: 1
quirrell was almost: 1
that day his: 1
harry had learned: 1
said it was: 1
i won't repeat: 1
respect headmaster dumbledore: 1
days do you: 1
- understand that: 1
there's anything wrong: 1
well you're welcome: 1
list of thirty-seven: 1
have company it's: 1
of my child: 1
decided he was: 1
say that would: 1
possibly act on: 1
even the most: 1
for themselves every: 1
it more difficult: 1
by older slytherins: 1
doing pointless things: 1
tried to take: 1
because i have: 1
defend yourself harry: 1
you or your: 1
about it is: 1
blinked he'd just: 1
to describe the: 1
dichotomy between the: 1
be trained harry: 1
fear me for: 1
glare neither of: 1
hurt someone doesn't: 1
it maybe you: 1
be even more: 1
rubbed his nose: 1
in this school: 1
was now waiting: 1
something i have: 1
slowly if there's: 1
absolutely not dumbledore: 1
times but still: 1
you lose him: 1
had secret passwords: 1
preferences of the: 1
professor quirrell's footsteps: 1
sprinkles and jeweled: 1
to learn potions: 1
talking about i: 1
what have all: 1
one time in: 1
travel i didn't: 1
otherwise i will: 1
would vaporize steel: 1
a fool harry: 1
mental privacy on: 1
is safe at: 1
work on that: 1
harry um he: 1
a copy of: 1
first prank in: 1
the unimportant things: 1
laughed oh now: 1
utter such a: 1
well professor quirrell: 1
a look of: 1
theorem in his: 1
bayesian definition of: 1
the same what: 1
dumbledore was frowning: 1
brain just seemed: 1
to kindness which: 1
once he became: 1
well obviously harry: 1
moon no sun: 1
own wish also: 1
probes would end: 1
quirrell in some: 1
was feeling a: 1
a friendly sense: 1
that's how it: 1
calmer or more: 1
when it happens: 1
professor quirrell wouldn't: 1
of all just: 1
now very serious: 1
you are held: 1
for common sense: 1
instead i will: 1
harry knew there: 1
potter's mind i: 1
is less improbable: 1
fine professor quirrell: 1
were in the: 1
to be dragging: 1
to stop you: 1
pardon me said: 1
man as your: 1
quirrell blinked again: 1
ever seen are: 1
a great wash: 1
me anything it's: 1
a licensed occlumency: 1
face let alone: 1
if i slept: 1
when you would: 1
professor quirrell rubbed: 1
to wanting to: 1
i cast it: 1
fall over harry: 1
for decades probably: 1
impulse to forgiveness: 1
sense of superiority: 1
blow it up: 1
no one else: 1
we're about to: 1
i would never: 1
not on you: 1
illness snuck them: 1
make it last: 1
much in common: 1
been cast you: 1
you from -: 1
the thought was: 1
science you do: 1
wouldn't have been: 1
would be nothing: 1
or more likely: 1
harry said blankly: 1
quirrell there was: 1
you decided that: 1
themselves and the: 1
the bayesian definition: 1
issues to my: 1
switch off but: 1
i could turn: 1
of today's events: 1
visible as a: 1
couldn't have added: 1
whole matter mr: 1
to help as: 1
all of it: 1
no said professor: 1
harry waited in: 1
potter but good: 1
less for trying: 1
blinked not to: 1
talk about it: 1
say it out: 1
headmaster said formally: 1
professor quirrell what: 1
mind wobbling in: 1
obliviated of each: 1
then lay back: 1
parents and that: 1
abashed what's wrong: 1
other well enough: 1
just an anger: 1
sacrilege harry managed: 1
a lot longer: 1
of my attentions: 1
they were probes: 1
with time professor: 1
have they done: 1
i only ever: 1
tell you about: 1
try to become: 1
i keep quiet: 1
that and those: 1
those fool muggles: 1
cause of -: 1
it out the: 1
people done for: 1
professor quirrell did: 1
saying i need: 1
mind when i: 1
you to the: 1
by far the: 1
about i was: 1
what i would: 1
wand and said: 1
work just as: 1
it out loud: 1
the mind of: 1
woman and showing: 1
project which might: 1
to harry and: 1
the spell once: 1
i went to: 1
quirrell was staring: 1
have thought of: 1
money that's the: 1
powerful wizard blew: 1
trying to look: 1
said in exactly: 1
what mr potter: 1
quirrell coughed loudly: 1
their impulse to: 1
the implications so: 1
to tell him: 1
his mental privacy: 1
nodded have you: 1
obtain books on: 1
he closed his: 1
indeed said professor: 1
expression as he: 1
less than a: 1
would end up: 1
we have that: 1
closely at harry's: 1
who discovered the: 1
sorting hat did: 1
concerns and had: 1
to maintain it: 1
stay in control: 1
mean it's right: 1
for lunch today: 1
nodded but he: 1
professor quirrell we: 1
above no surrounding: 1
heard talking about: 1
ceiling of the: 1
he had expected: 1
of hogwarts and: 1
might react mr: 1
usually prefer to: 1
as before stopped: 1
an accident there: 1
shriek quirinus how: 1
and found himself: 1
with the obvious: 1
him either way: 1
than moral considerations: 1
was a friendly: 1
mental privacy mr: 1
it on impulse: 1
side harry sat: 1
a math teacher: 1
man and a: 1
was implacable there: 1
harry's brain just: 1
the magic which: 1
little fools who: 1
space the stars: 1
wrong in such: 1
wild the world: 1
not i -: 1
sky of earth: 1
upon your head: 1
the pioneer program: 1
which sheltered me: 1
potter didn't tell: 1
but i think: 1
quiet it almost: 1
lay back on: 1
you and then: 1
him professor quirrell: 1
do you really: 1
you could be: 1
he organized his: 1
gringotts to recommend: 1
awesome stuff have: 1
convince everyone you're: 1
the professor and: 1
he stood unsupported: 1
all my students: 1
since as the: 1
recently that i've: 1
unable to say: 1
both sighed even: 1
few moments of: 1
professor quirrell chuckled: 1
on becoming the: 1
before stopped short: 1
said who now: 1
come out of: 1
your own body: 1
can you guess: 1
will inform madam: 1
enough for your: 1
then closed it: 1
a time i: 1
have not answered: 1
act sometimes we: 1
dumbledore still didn't: 1
it that you: 1
tell you to: 1
on the one: 1
harry's feet stayed: 1
people who have: 1
what was it: 1
different planets and: 1
harry kept on: 1
keep me down: 1
to hufflepuff harry: 1
not to mention: 1
a brief look: 1
was now harry's: 1
quirrell blinked not: 1
means that people: 1
the same to: 1
the stars looked: 1
headmaster but it: 1
point and the: 1
your own suggestion: 1
dragging their feet: 1
blood runs cold: 1
color looks a: 1
i'm a big: 1
said the headmaster: 1
that would vaporize: 1
blackness an infinite: 1
instructor have taken: 1
not dumbledore said: 1
the other marble: 1
may indeed so: 1
in the entire: 1
been unable to: 1
disconcertment crossed dumbledore's: 1
quirrell said he: 1
a golden plaque: 1
it's the ethical: 1
objections to the: 1
sighed even if: 1
the same place: 1
wizards know that: 1
lose him may: 1
was a feeling: 1
his desk the: 1
ah-hem professor quirrell: 1
trouble you would: 1
he peered closely: 1
just happened you: 1
been made and: 1
advice there is: 1
pattern and needs: 1
was a wrench: 1
more likely you: 1
pause your dark: 1
the plaque did: 1
is allowed to: 1
said that was: 1
ethical theory that: 1
a spell to: 1
stars are so: 1
import of an: 1
the knowledge could: 1
said just no: 1
long as it: 1
there was something: 1
own body and: 1
self the self: 1
rather stupid indeed: 1
times never predictable: 1
parents took me: 1
i am rather: 1
own suggestion though: 1
is now quite: 1
love of crap: 1
of such incandescent: 1
happy with the: 1
problem harry spoke: 1
and into interstellar: 1
i was offended: 1
you for everything: 1
unspeakable or minister: 1
help me well: 1
so of course: 1
a halt before: 1
the stars were: 1
the gray ceiling: 1
forever professor quirrell: 1
unsupported against the: 1
over sometimes professor: 1
by the lesser: 1
fifty feet taller: 1
headmaster had some: 1
harry had grown: 1
would imagine this: 1
it's easy to: 1
sense about him: 1
bodylengths away does: 1
jeweled with tiny: 1
that he agree: 1
wizard knows that: 1
secrets which physicists: 1
it otherwise would: 1
place far away: 1
void with countless: 1
heart like nothing: 1
into a portrait: 1
read it anyway: 1
and the bayesian: 1
so they put: 1
dark lord that's: 1
the preferences of: 1
said preference utilitarianism: 1
said again dumbledore: 1
you're seeing is: 1
harry a stern: 1
satisfaction believe it: 1
that there's anything: 1
section which holds: 1
of the pioneer: 1
control his face: 1
the room a: 1
from where he: 1
that helpless feeling: 1
indignation what on: 1
no ambitions of: 1
the constant threat: 1
must realize that: 1
again with a: 1
existing part into: 1
suppressed laughter in: 1
anger management problem: 1
not be worth: 1
only if you: 1
the darkness the: 1
add any extra: 1
that mean that: 1
harry couldn't just: 1
harry had that: 1
of all my: 1
that you do: 1
'right' to things: 1
and those idiot: 1
already surmised your: 1
dark lord was: 1
said what have: 1
asked you an: 1
need to make: 1
quirrell finally what: 1
over him somehow: 1
had happened earlier: 1
gray ceiling of: 1
stern glare neither: 1
them out of: 1
said i couldn't: 1
thought it would: 1
of this present: 1
very good mr: 1
with anyone else: 1
possible that perfectly: 1
things that had: 1
a weak point: 1
ever see it: 1
that power to: 1
of the ceiling: 1
you were sorted: 1
for which you: 1
of - the: 1
evil explained harry: 1
picture of a: 1
it's been with: 1
is a stupid: 1
headmaster harry said: 1
it almost wasn't: 1
vanished into oblivion: 1
is nonetheless improbable: 1
a whisper please: 1
slight grin a: 1
not because of: 1
out of me: 1
to give up: 1
seem to imagine: 1
far the most: 1
constant all the: 1
was your age: 1
take this the: 1
forgive me if: 1
about in fact: 1
all someday professor: 1
as subtle as: 1
subtle as atlas: 1
surmised your intent: 1
gone not today: 1
he passed a: 1
give names like: 1
here awhile professor: 1
your intention i: 1
nothing left to: 1
portable yet soft: 1
his tutor absolutely: 1
opened the door: 1
him and the: 1
professor quirrell and: 1
snapped your fingers: 1
part of today's: 1
and one of: 1
but are you: 1
a mysterious dark: 1
potter went through: 1
for the boy-who-lived: 1
of no time: 1
potter i have: 1
lead that is: 1
be much point: 1
ideas down the: 1
was around as: 1
learn martial arts: 1
fired eventually harry: 1
white marble in: 1
suspicious considering that: 1
does that matter: 1
being grateful to: 1
of this morning: 1
the likelihood that: 1
quirrell what have: 1
found your true: 1
repeat what i'm: 1
not object if: 1
difficult than he: 1
am about to: 1
to never become: 1
that was around: 1
showed me how: 1
still or might: 1
the professor you: 1
and guess harry: 1
harry's eyes he: 1
your power for: 1
decided to simply: 1
flickered in the: 1
of white marble: 1
my attentions professor: 1
darkness the sight: 1
that is the: 1
harry potter he: 1
some unknown fashion: 1
was upon your: 1
the power of: 1
and jeweled with: 1
laughed a further: 1
quirrell don't take: 1
usual-looking dry smile: 1
to abandon the: 1
if we are: 1
should have seen: 1
your mental privacy: 1
and then decided: 1
must do on: 1
talk to me: 1
vow to reveal: 1
anticipatory professor quirrell: 1
not - i: 1
potter i must: 1
of course but: 1
of you-know-who there: 1
dark lord harry: 1
a muggle bulletin: 1
making him a: 1
like in star: 1
was hard however: 1
finger on his: 1
without hurting himself: 1
harry hadn't felt: 1
come to collapsing: 1
i didn't hear: 1
wizard said slowly: 1
heard of the: 1
an irrelevant question: 1
quirrell's voice had: 1
or hm a: 1
mistaken for common: 1
accused harry of: 1
a thousand sometimes: 1
this man as: 1
floor with a: 1
him may or: 1
i usually prefer: 1
stars looked terribly: 1
said slowly why: 1
think i was: 1
single lesson and: 1
licensed occlumency instructor: 1
quirrell quietly when: 1
become omnipotent and: 1
a much more: 1
tasty harry hadn't: 1
be wrong anyway: 1
tell me mr: 1
at the door: 1
the hat's choice: 1
quirrell and departed: 1
you done that: 1
go on making: 1
system and into: 1
the ethical theory: 1
mistake me for: 1
not fear me: 1
keep it to: 1
probable harry blinked: 1
if they lacked: 1
it dumbledore sighed: 1
to do to: 1
kept on wiping: 1
it was as: 1
that harry said: 1
changed from something: 1
go about it: 1
nodded to both: 1
a picture of: 1
it then how: 1
harry it is: 1
quirrell's desk which: 1
serious and very: 1
is that about: 1
no wonder professor: 1
surprise although i: 1
since you have: 1
defense position one: 1
came down hard: 1
do not open: 1
that harry had: 1
to discuss such: 1
impulse is not: 1
make my traps: 1
his mouth then: 1
beaten and humiliated: 1
you like a: 1
terribly terribly far: 1
for someone who: 1
the world would: 1
as your teacher: 1
here harry said: 1
ambitions of becoming: 1
focus of my: 1
not harry had: 1
to harry you: 1
harry's mind as: 1
will ask his: 1
came into harry's: 1
from anyone not: 1
dying of a: 1
again the sorting: 1
me so of: 1
gently mr potter: 1
terribly terribly terribly: 1
not that there's: 1
- i can't: 1
tones wham professor: 1
but still sometimes: 1
- imagine yourself: 1
matter to you: 1
our desires wherever: 1
but in the: 1
appropriately harry looked: 1
matter mr potter: 1
i must also: 1
a cat a: 1
smart enough to: 1
can't have every: 1
the wrong way: 1
sometimes people give: 1
he had ever: 1
end the spell: 1
can want to: 1
there really and: 1
they died in: 1
for as long: 1
part of me: 1
repeated professor quirrell: 1
purpose except to: 1
good is what: 1
which keeps me: 1
account manager at: 1
discovered that pioneer: 1
said harry absolutely: 1
wrong with experimenting: 1
said the professor: 1
if i go: 1
is to know: 1
of them i'm: 1
anything i can: 1
a feeling that: 1
impulse is what: 1
hat did seem: 1
great fighting wizard: 1
did not win: 1
become a great: 1
dumbledore sighed i: 1
unknown fashion harry: 1
myself and become: 1
the walls and: 1
it is a: 1
gems looking highly: 1
on that they: 1
read he wouldn't: 1
sort of science: 1
to recommend a: 1
was the ambition: 1
but harry didn't: 1
are her work: 1
it was upon: 1
of the classroom: 1
so just how: 1
frightening precision and: 1
is how to: 1
clear that professor: 1
that perfectly good: 1
tell there was: 1
so that you: 1
and would probably: 1
will have your: 1
sometimes professor quirrell: 1
which you were: 1
so then since: 1
me how to: 1
accepting it i'm: 1
if it's money: 1
all words that: 1
wonder professor quirrell: 1
the full use: 1
away from the: 1
and become a: 1
evident to anyone: 1
wrong way i: 1
which you lose: 1
two - which: 1
it might exist: 1
if it was: 1
am sorry for: 1
quirrell but the: 1
me in when: 1
that had been: 1
very perspicacious of: 1
both of them: 1
future occasions dumbledore: 1
milky way was: 1
improbable that a: 1
quirrell but are: 1
no it is: 1
quirrell nodded have: 1
let me read: 1
could take the: 1
not be graded: 1
you couldn't have: 1
bridge of his: 1
shall have your: 1
arches of the: 1
going to be: 1
intricate confections of: 1
quirrell's expression was: 1
me mr potter: 1
to the probe: 1
this present time: 1
expensive and proving: 1
too perfect real: 1
intelligence and the: 1
be destroyed by: 1
the dark lord: 1
blah blah appeal: 1
miss this for: 1
it works now: 1
of me and: 1
golden plaque which: 1
intriguing if nothing: 1
having discovered your: 1
are secrets you: 1
would certainly be: 1
here nuclear weapons: 1
starting to think: 1
some unimaginable realm: 1
on it harry: 1
there's any threat: 1
in the newspapers: 1
feeling rather stupid: 1
at dumbledore ah-hem: 1
feel it too: 1
sad but harry: 1
raise your right: 1
resist meddling are: 1
be trained yes: 1
i've seen this: 1
just another part: 1
dumbledore's face followed: 1
marble in the: 1
hand over both: 1
giving harry a: 1
earth do i: 1
a slight pause: 1
as well to: 1
i snuck into: 1
to defeat the: 1
said there was: 1
blasted off their: 1
- fool said: 1
the intent to: 1
and thank you: 1
way to defeat: 1
long enough to: 1
that was what: 1
large amounts of: 1
it's a new: 1
not answered my: 1
you really think: 1
now professor quirrell: 1
ambition oh said: 1
your age that: 1
potter in the: 1
quirrell his face: 1
with the tiniest: 1
he tapped a: 1
quirrell had accused: 1
- you lunatic: 1
to convince everyone: 1
concern for harry: 1
time i confess: 1
would know that: 1
lord i see: 1
old wizard straightened: 1
what follows you: 1
against perfect blackness: 1
star wars said: 1
place might be: 1
to do sometimes: 1
wizard straightened up: 1
potter is allowed: 1
really and truly: 1
today being a: 1
the states of: 1
discreet about the: 1
through to earn: 1
the professor's eyes: 1
couldn't act on: 1
brain's worth of: 1
to themselves and: 1
harry sat up: 1
detect that was: 1
one project which: 1
not your wanting: 1
consider me asked: 1
upon harry seemed: 1
about that harry: 1
worse with time: 1
so you are: 1
intent to kill: 1
and i've seen: 1
the other hand: 1
all know that: 1
on wiping his: 1
think so then: 1
he is not: 1
want to be: 1
good people and: 1
realized what dumbledore: 1
i'm about to: 1
very still dumbledore: 1
anyway can i: 1
for wanting to: 1
was it that: 1
the small room: 1
and take pictures: 1
on the other: 1
harry said to: 1
i did not: 1
seemed to keep: 1
explained harry if: 1
said again it's: 1
smiled with satisfaction: 1
was simply 'don't: 1
predictable times but: 1
allowed to obtain: 1
i have already: 1
things and thought: 1
cold everything gets: 1
not in what: 1
down from a: 1
he used that: 1
was what i: 1
rewrite reality because: 1
more usual-looking dry: 1
thought students should: 1
important there is: 1
you found a: 1
have a mysterious: 1
and the discipline: 1
in common professor: 1
placed there he'd: 1
is what satisfies: 1
my place -: 1
believe it or: 1
lovely golden plaque: 1
and reached out: 1
go through my: 1
most people -: 1
does professor quirrell: 1
did you extra: 1
list all the: 1
a time of: 1
i insist that: 1
system forever professor: 1
tell professor mcgonagall: 1
something right if: 1
on a small: 1
me isn't that: 1
asked harry wasn't: 1
little off harry: 1
me and he: 1
had expected well: 1
to work hard: 1
now seemed to: 1
that nuclear physicists: 1
didn't know whether: 1
sad and reverent: 1
was such an: 1
to think about: 1
to pass between: 1
looking highly expensive: 1
on the classroom: 1
i go on: 1
just because i: 1
a spell requiring: 1
of what mr: 1
first part a: 1
thought and realized: 1
voice of quiet: 1
stars burning terribly: 1
plaque did you: 1
dumbledore said looking: 1
were all sorts: 1
that i keep: 1
expecting them but: 1
was the last: 1
then said dumbledore: 1
guess harry imagined: 1
asked first professor: 1
all sorts of: 1
with the intent: 1
at things than: 1
path to becoming: 1
away does professor: 1
myself can think: 1
public service you: 1
harry what are: 1
anyone's face let: 1
me that you: 1
when my parents: 1
i must say: 1
idea to me: 1
and that impulse: 1
disputing it your: 1
at the professor: 1
otherwise would yes: 1
what the confusion: 1
will not be: 1
and anticipatory professor: 1
quirrell raised his: 1
said completing the: 1
assembling the thirty-seven: 1
in my shoes: 1
fool but please: 1
human death would: 1
realize that if: 1
i don't think: 1
happens that was: 1
be some other: 1
rare teachers to: 1
holds those same: 1
him appropriately harry: 1
and i strongly: 1
you will find: 1
knows about -: 1
tell him professor: 1
for trying to: 1
professor quirrell sounding: 1
you use the: 1
quirrell was wrong: 1
by the rowling: 1
the fifty-one points: 1
shock at both: 1
way professor quirrell: 1
do suggest that: 1
you extra information: 1
theory that the: 1
and it grew: 1
spell on that: 1
forbade any vengeance: 1
his vision the: 1
circumstances students should: 1
i don't want: 1
exactly what was: 1
regardless of circumstances: 1
was not happy: 1
space program too: 1
wonder whether there: 1
i will never: 1
raise my right: 1
question mr potter: 1
and the other: 1
nuclear weapons professor: 1
was to learn: 1
longer than it: 1
you can do: 1
answered my original: 1
because he didn't: 1
willing to discuss: 1
feet on the: 1
was offended they: 1
sorted into slytherin: 1
your days in: 1
oh some said: 1
cannot help but: 1
too they walked: 1
physicists should have: 1
dark lord doesn't: 1
make that act: 1
threat the defense: 1
role to play: 1
child self the: 1
professor quirrell's quiet: 1
so without it: 1
could put it: 1
not the next: 1
know you are: 1
implying i will: 1
end up on: 1
marble of the: 1
economical at least: 1
fingers rubbed the: 1
quirinus how dare: 1
thought of exactly: 1
one of them: 1
know your own: 1
i'm afraid it: 1
you other people: 1
the first things: 1
true impulse to: 1
firmly no mr: 1
the door classes: 1
what did you: 1
that spell if: 1
and i do: 1
dark lord said: 1
a little off: 1
to understand everything: 1
i am feeling: 1
recess and i: 1
tears came into: 1
on and harry: 1
brag' - and: 1
just as easily: 1
do not stand: 1
appeal to my: 1
have deprived him: 1
would probably respect: 1
quirrell sounding as: 1
hurt surely you've: 1
my right hand: 1
merely angry i: 1
how you go: 1
and over sometimes: 1
away where i: 1
and it will: 1
plaque which will: 1
stay with the: 1
could turn back: 1
feeling this was: 1
looking at things: 1
achieve my objectives: 1
was sad and: 1
somehow remove that: 1
it what's going: 1
quietly and not: 1
classroom around us: 1
have been made: 1
transparent lie after: 1
in space no: 1
spell if it: 1
would corrupt me: 1
now we must: 1
legilimens in this: 1
store a whole: 1
from a few: 1
that took them: 1
no sun that: 1
someone who wasn't: 1
it would still: 1
prevent you from: 1
own phoenix song: 1
right hand what: 1
use your power: 1
lord did not: 1
me while i: 1
rather suspicious considering: 1
that you keep: 1
head no wonder: 1
harry as if: 1
early on and: 1
those things you: 1
grew brighter as: 1
all just because: 1
quirrell said dryly: 1
potter while the: 1
i'll have to: 1
of admission mr: 1
i would dream: 1
probable explanation is: 1
his mind got: 1
harry i apologize: 1
not today said: 1
a finger on: 1
10 until they: 1
space travel said: 1
don't like professor: 1
your secret is: 1
it your concern: 1
learn to stay: 1
floor vanished the: 1
themselves they told: 1
want to rule: 1
am i off: 1
enough for today: 1
earth no moon: 1
there are seals: 1
in exactly the: 1
and he was: 1
sorry for disputing: 1
you like get: 1
of what i: 1
wouldn't accept my: 1
ever learned then: 1
far away it: 1
ministry as dark: 1
still didn't understand: 1
have that much: 1
of the strangest: 1
laughter in the: 1
it harry had: 1
politicians and now: 1
full use of: 1
dark lord the: 1
people you want: 1
you - gently: 1
quirrell we can: 1
hand whether or: 1
let wizardkind escape: 1
were sorted into: 1
to my sense: 1
much awesome stuff: 1
he wiped them: 1
safe at hogwarts: 1
said yes very: 1
might be some: 1
professor you're already: 1
could've turned an: 1
had no purpose: 1
have some objections: 1
i don't see: 1
that was just: 1
with all distances: 1
that time to: 1
their fool politicians: 1
it took harry: 1
the path of: 1
are so very: 1
ravenclaw professor quirrell: 1
the uptake he: 1
is so small: 1
any case mr: 1
hey said harry: 1
wizard or head: 1
the love of: 1
understand that the: 1
lord the import: 1
dumbledore said at: 1
turned into a: 1
slowly why not: 1
seriousness what was: 1
you deem them: 1
very wide and: 1
the galaxy professor: 1
anyone who lacks: 1
this he said: 1
believe it exists: 1
kept to themselves: 1
a book that: 1
are held back: 1
tomorrow either i'm: 1
sat down on: 1
professor has offered: 1
of the unimportant: 1
more to science: 1
harry quickly took: 1
method but by: 1
have added any: 1
do as a: 1
kill us all: 1
agree to be: 1
dark lord unless: 1
parallel right away: 1
the plaque -: 1
knew there were: 1
decades probably said: 1
is a true: 1
harry wasn't looking: 1
the small circle: 1
more than moral: 1
evidence available to: 1
try not to: 1
magic or -: 1
not going to: 1
passed his face: 1
grasp at all: 1
say mr potter: 1
with the current: 1
that's quite enough: 1
harm and i: 1
too why does: 1
what makes something: 1
it's a book: 1
sometimes when you: 1
hinges and skittered: 1
wondered what the: 1
a holographic message: 1
face what did: 1
solemnly with only: 1
i know what's: 1
silence for a: 1
attracting public notice: 1
what dumbledore had: 1
would yes professor: 1
people have done: 1
expression changed from: 1
behind my back: 1
walls and ceilings: 1
going to violate: 1
of common sense: 1
that seemed a: 1
closed his eyes: 1
would dumbledore be: 1
he tapped his: 1
at dumbledore legilimency: 1
today of all: 1
my blood runs: 1
he would learn: 1
sun in the: 1
i won't talk: 1
no time and: 1
small as to: 1
science a scientist: 1
get improbable evidence: 1
must protest you: 1
names like 'right': 1
while harry nodded: 1
available to professor: 1
again it's a: 1
having access to: 1
face still kept: 1
moving away from: 1
it's money that's: 1
keeps me informed: 1
vision adjusted to: 1
you didn't add: 1
thing slowly dumbledore's: 1
it harry wondered: 1
professor quirrell's desk: 1
golden plaque on: 1
super magical powers: 1
dark lord you: 1
crap harry said: 1
though i have: 1
have been still: 1
- gently mr: 1
and very still: 1
you have deprived: 1
reveal nothing and: 1
a voice of: 1
anything important while: 1
friendly sense about: 1
let alone anyone: 1
just been beaten: 1
i will do: 1
dryly it's an: 1
which you must: 1
smidgin of common: 1
thought i would: 1
to stay in: 1
object if i: 1
from them harry: 1
me honestly what: 1
last a lot: 1
be asking about: 1
rational judgment given: 1
should steer away: 1
when i finished: 1
screaming from the: 1
quirrell was just: 1
that act resembles: 1
in becoming a: 1
universe apply that: 1
whether professor quirrell: 1
here what are: 1
you well know: 1
slept for a: 1
angry harry explained: 1
entire world they: 1
martial arts and: 1
defense professor you're: 1
are you sure: 1
blew into the: 1
side is really: 1
quirrell i think: 1
with respect headmaster: 1
had i thought: 1
and proving in: 1
that dumbledore still: 1
only one that: 1
which i'd read: 1
to get there: 1
professor and saw: 1
would be betrayed: 1
being any kind: 1
your first day: 1
mr potter didn't: 1
trained harry said: 1
hadn't occurred to: 1
harry medicine maybe: 1
insist that the: 1
killed by the: 1
a lot out: 1
harry stared up: 1
for permission you: 1
of you mr: 1
repeat what you're: 1
goal it drove: 1
oath or you: 1
made it more: 1
and yet he: 1
said looking at: 1
too many legilimens: 1
probe but maybe: 1
you're not dark: 1
my objectives through: 1
worthy of salazar: 1
it again with: 1
had a medical: 1
there are gates: 1
best knowable guess: 1
in shock at: 1
the power for: 1
it will only: 1
much indignation what: 1
the floor vanished: 1
of the floor: 1
deem them necessary: 1
headmaster thank you: 1
was quite intrigued: 1
harry said trying: 1
years while it: 1
had just happened: 1
passed across his: 1
mind couldn't grasp: 1
harry laughed oh: 1
face harry you: 1
hogwarts that seemed: 1
was leaning harder: 1
you're a light: 1
for me harry: 1
that's quite what: 1
abandon the ambition: 1
mind of my: 1
understand and thank: 1
sorts of incredibly: 1
any extra mass: 1
it was hard: 1
when he closed: 1
simply go with: 1
thundercloud an ancient: 1
look the same: 1
still so that: 1
something merely angry: 1
who have just: 1
of me to: 1
person to help: 1
as a matter: 1
understand what had: 1
items on the: 1
their star-gazing interrupted: 1
angry but to: 1
with perfect regularity: 1
i read as: 1
toilet the instant: 1
trying to do: 1
the rowling should: 1
grinning so i: 1
mere student you: 1
lord unless i: 1
cast it on: 1
his thoughts to: 1
and i cannot: 1
thoughts to understand: 1
broccoli when that: 1
than a minute: 1
holes through which: 1
but our own: 1
an important life: 1
had learned to: 1
none of harry's: 1
took them out: 1
remove that ambition: 1
no purpose except: 1
portrait seems to: 1
survivors all know: 1
even more precise: 1
field of stars: 1
the ministry as: 1
own said professor: 1
as a thirteen-year-old: 1
do you propose: 1
wasting your days: 1
them for themselves: 1
you're about to: 1
into nasa and: 1
breach the fools: 1
face was it: 1
the dais so: 1
said but i: 1
confusing you here: 1
frowning such services: 1
have gotten into: 1
people said professor: 1
lot out of: 1
perfectly it maintained: 1
on you but: 1
protest you or: 1
out anyway once: 1
the sight wrenched: 1
for it dumbledore: 1
yes professor quirrell: 1
moral considerations if: 1
hateful i wonder: 1
other people have: 1
harry said and: 1
it either way: 1
say said harry: 1
he realized what: 1
imagine this as: 1
said then i: 1
quietly but he: 1
can't seem to: 1
your intent to: 1
quirinus your wisdom: 1
but please do: 1
i know that: 1
credit as well: 1
concerned headmaster that: 1
your friends having: 1
a rather different: 1
the brilliance from: 1
uptake he should: 1
allow you to: 1
- harry started: 1
didn't keep it: 1
it's an important: 1
to tell there: 1
respect him less: 1
information said professor: 1
the classroom around: 1
much more usual-looking: 1
spell again harry: 1
in five decades: 1
him to see: 1
worth considering i: 1
professor quirrell with: 1
have for lunch: 1
had actually been: 1
instructor with respect: 1
facets were happy: 1
my wanting to: 1
with a much: 1
it was long: 1
wanting to be: 1
which as you: 1
couldn't grasp at: 1
headmaster did you: 1
not come cheaply: 1
other people are: 1
water blurring his: 1
it is step: 1
yet he left: 1
to end up: 1
that would fly: 1
atlas shrugged pardon: 1
in some unknown: 1
he'd eaten quite: 1
- what makes: 1
for a moment: 1
is really just: 1
laughed then harry: 1
feet stayed constant: 1
the evidence available: 1
but he could: 1
yet found your: 1
angry i heard: 1
quirrell nodded he: 1
that side of: 1
into slytherin i: 1
or was it: 1
harry recognized professor: 1
time and somehow: 1
deliberately harry looked: 1
of science you: 1
tiny jewels set: 1
giant velvet dome: 1
the instructor have: 1
like nothing there: 1
harry said slowly: 1
around us stand: 1
your concern for: 1
i'm not dumb: 1
was standing up: 1
forget the small: 1
that which can: 1
harry opened his: 1
annihilation this was: 1
as he realized: 1
of time and: 1
to me about: 1
happy about having: 1
least we have: 1
science harry said: 1
have already surmised: 1
my mind when: 1
he was grinning: 1
justification for his: 1
mr potter is: 1
no earth no: 1
seen the parallel: 1
expression was implacable: 1
like professor quirrell: 1
mr potter in: 1
i promise you: 1
mr potter if: 1
tapped his other: 1
an anger management: 1
i did and: 1
in harry's mind: 1
harry said am: 1
albus percival -: 1
from complaining -: 1
were no longer: 1
disapproval does that: 1
up harry nodded: 1
learn and refine: 1
things to rats: 1
way i'll have: 1
of stars burning: 1
dumbledore there is: 1
for invading your: 1
or another you: 1
tried to read: 1
what we are: 1
leaves traces which: 1
address him appropriately: 1
galaxy professor quirrell: 1
promise you will: 1
added any extra: 1
skill it was: 1
tutor absolutely not: 1
seem to think: 1
the marble in: 1
through my mind: 1
mr potter receive: 1
cast the spell: 1
into place a: 1
place a part: 1
i think that's: 1
with tiny sugar: 1
that the instructor: 1
and that was: 1
obvious blah blah: 1
story enough times: 1
if you fire: 1
time there wouldn't: 1
is my mysterious: 1
important while i: 1
stern look he: 1
of crap harry: 1
and turned back: 1
running and running: 1
will never stop: 1
could say that: 1
potter tell me: 1
i'll take my: 1
a matter of: 1
great surge of: 1
money quickly -: 1
after that and: 1
but he will: 1
would see the: 1
beaten for fifteen: 1
mass to the: 1
- i understand: 1
order to convince: 1
as if the: 1
which had apparently: 1
trying to say: 1
impulse to kindness: 1
just seemed to: 1
for mr potter's: 1
hadn't felt the: 1
his teacher and: 1
around fifty feet: 1
enough nonetheless i: 1
to take away: 1
about pioneer 10: 1
i held it: 1
about having their: 1
hurt harry floundered: 1
sort of thing: 1
that your intention: 1
a stern glare: 1
quirrell said i: 1
precise then while: 1
confections of chocolate: 1
to do but: 1
end people all: 1
and the survivors: 1
life skill it: 1
convincing way that: 1
objectives through the: 1
to a muggle: 1
but by far: 1
immediately afterward dumbledore: 1
was grinning so: 1
me read because: 1
of the most: 1
strides had come: 1
you harbor no: 1
my parents and: 1
my original question: 1
do when you're: 1
proving in fact: 1
face was calmer: 1
suppose you could: 1
as atlas shrugged: 1
is their impulse: 1
have seen the: 1
way was already: 1
up professor quirrell: 1
again said professor: 1
i am not: 1
ash they never: 1
seemed to be: 1
and realized we: 1
graciously forgive their: 1
can i ask: 1
closed it again: 1
harry's ears and: 1
copy of you-know-who: 1
lost points will: 1
are we in: 1
himself how exactly: 1
confess i am: 1
harry mr potter: 1
as the defense: 1
met one it: 1
quirrell now looking: 1
i believe it: 1
perhaps because he: 1
harry didn't say: 1
seen on anyone's: 1
tell you have: 1
dumbledore decided he: 1
do once he: 1
you will lose: 1
you must not: 1
dark lord instead: 1
more difficult than: 1
wizard but then: 1
harry whispered it: 1
who now seemed: 1
it out anyway: 1
i suppose there: 1
defense at hogwarts: 1
i have done: 1
do it either: 1
professor quirrell raised: 1
a giant velvet: 1
knew each other: 1
good mr potter: 1
pointless things to: 1
move me but: 1
potions class with: 1
i can't even: 1
sense so your: 1
i wonder professor: 1
on the hard: 1
trying to keep: 1
wisdom is now: 1
are over said: 1
you to convince: 1
secrets of science: 1
who can't resist: 1
back that hadn't: 1
a medical test: 1
will you permit: 1
you from complaining: 1
the survivors all: 1
up with it: 1
him in the: 1
such incandescent rage: 1
can only imagine: 1
that and i: 1
need to tell: 1
ah harry said: 1
his eyes over: 1
to earn back: 1
never forget this: 1
possible observation confirm: 1
rotating into place: 1
dark side but: 1
see professor quirrell: 1
jinx on the: 1
avoid flushing new: 1
sheltered me that: 1
of you is: 1
mind got it: 1
your wisdom is: 1
a fool but: 1
harry you must: 1
constant threat of: 1
too slow on: 1
to talk about: 1
subscribe to a: 1
was something you: 1
or might have: 1
knows that even: 1
nuclear weapons didn't: 1
less probable harry: 1
awhile professor quirrell: 1
his account manager: 1
would get hurt: 1
the widest that: 1
people you like: 1
his wand and: 1
same place as: 1
that there are: 1
dumbledore he nodded: 1
professor quirrell smiled: 1
then again said: 1
never to repeat: 1
will make it: 1
strange passed across: 1
you propose to: 1
not wish to: 1
to reveal nothing: 1
the self of: 1
mind then i: 1
to forget the: 1
into harry's eyes: 1
help but wonder: 1
earth here there: 1
thought of your: 1
irrelevant question to: 1
wasn't a fool: 1
it harry nodded: 1
loud it was: 1
fashion harry had: 1
off harry the: 1
i - harry: 1
dumbledore be asking: 1
lord put yourself: 1
by accepting it: 1
of all days: 1
rats hey said: 1
you're already doomed: 1
away from them: 1
realized we might: 1
asked for permission: 1
realm beyond in: 1
to say professor: 1
walked across the: 1
our own desires: 1
became a dark: 1
professor quirrell anyone: 1
was that thought: 1
someone tried to: 1
a list of: 1
hard to describe: 1
a scientist repeated: 1
the last probable: 1
the hard marble: 1
into if you: 1
the suppressed laughter: 1
you must realize: 1
would fall for: 1
of looking at: 1
when i was: 1
know mysterious dark: 1
knew exactly what: 1
the portable yet: 1
your parents' disapproval: 1
shouting now even: 1
made harry rather: 1
secret passwords would: 1
friends having access: 1
of the hidden: 1
turned back to: 1
the shock none: 1
of science a: 1
first things i: 1
wasn't there when: 1
harry or hm: 1
surely you've wanted: 1
me if this: 1
it leaves traces: 1
never become angry: 1
guess what thought: 1
live under the: 1
your ambition oh: 1
had earlier turned: 1
to ever get: 1
it grew brighter: 1
anyone else about: 1
was the only: 1
grin a word: 1
learn how to: 1
of annihilation this: 1
what i was: 1
pioneer 10 until: 1
and kicked him: 1
were probes that: 1
something strange passed: 1
a light lord: 1
convince me i: 1
to impress their: 1
it's fine harry: 1
have let wizardkind: 1
burning terribly bright: 1
me more than: 1
i can't believe: 1
which will make: 1
once it has: 1
suddenly nervous then: 1
welcome said professor: 1
hand over his: 1
quirrell's quiet voice: 1
my dominance but: 1
the way it: 1
actually been implying: 1
cast a rare: 1
hand over him: 1
exactly do you: 1
don't think that's: 1
couldn't just blurt: 1
and a woman: 1
the entire world: 1
implacable there are: 1
was regarding him: 1
lacked the power: 1
i finished assembling: 1
as easily do: 1
explained my blood: 1
had the dichotomy: 1
what are we: 1
choose this man: 1
that had happened: 1
secrets you do: 1
harry said don't: 1
dark side and: 1
and i resolved: 1
hurt too why: 1
said i shall: 1
can do to: 1
felt the least: 1
my shoes -: 1
in a thousand: 1
and cast a: 1
you heard the: 1
indignation observed professor: 1
on the list: 1
tired it got: 1
do i have: 1
to forgiveness or: 1
not yet found: 1
it simply was: 1
is to become: 1
hurt it means: 1
earlier he would: 1
ambition is worthy: 1
desires wherever they: 1
thought occurred to: 1
but wonder why: 1
harry had seen: 1
a trifle too: 1
cheaply dumbledore said: 1
i thought and: 1
you do approve: 1
where i should: 1
headmaster dumbledore after: 1
resolved my parental: 1
with the hat's: 1
was it an: 1
believe him and: 1
which the sorting: 1
a whole human: 1
be standing around: 1
his face harry: 1
away - understand: 1
it i'm not: 1
you to have: 1
you storm out: 1
decided that if: 1
wizardkind escape this: 1
said i won't: 1
headmaster stared in: 1
like what happened: 1
your theory and: 1
of science passed: 1
suggestion though i: 1
said harry um: 1
act on moral: 1
harry he said: 1
other marble of: 1
have asked first: 1
extra information to: 1
anyone as dignified: 1
locked eyes and: 1
you're trying to: 1
understood then harry: 1
to see which: 1
can't believe this: 1
ambition for which: 1
harry floundered for: 1
sometimes mistaken for: 1
plaque - mr: 1
got hurt too: 1
stopped short of: 1
saw no need: 1
seen this story: 1
should not be: 1
clear in retrospect: 1
finished assembling the: 1
then since you: 1
wizard to come: 1
you try to: 1
to hurt get: 1
preliminary training which: 1
and i wonder: 1
had masks actually: 1
the space program: 1
his face still: 1
than that not: 1
harry said precisely: 1
how your classmates: 1
the stars it: 1
as you well: 1
for me to: 1
at harry something: 1
my leave of: 1
mind at the: 1
results said professor: 1
course i read: 1
ran away rotating: 1
the most terrible: 1
consider professor quirrell: 1
to stay with: 1
there were all: 1
enough stress to: 1
them smiled dumbledore's: 1
absolutely said professor: 1
image tears came: 1
it ah harry: 1
how can i: 1
in such a: 1
would have figured: 1
management problem like: 1
to protect his: 1
if you choose: 1
just blurt it: 1
steel into something: 1
voice then harry: 1
that i've been: 1
when you forbade: 1
have to do: 1
to stand up: 1
what you were: 1
they lead that: 1
guessed that my: 1
medical test that: 1
neither of them: 1
have some ideas: 1
magic which i: 1
he nodded to: 1
quickly took his: 1
who wasn't willing: 1
little sad but: 1
actually for all: 1
passed a hand: 1
said in meekly: 1
maybe you could've: 1
give up on: 1
quirrell was giving: 1
you know mysterious: 1
sugar gems looking: 1
you should have: 1
your word your: 1
well enough nonetheless: 1
the path that: 1
as soon as: 1
earth is that: 1
knowledge to become: 1
dark lord now: 1
you wasting your: 1
was just about: 1
have been moving: 1
at all words: 1
or anything and: 1
was time for: 1
a rare and: 1
after harry had: 1
more difficult to: 1
him and would: 1
of innocent bystanders: 1
at once i: 1
but he was: 1
you go about: 1
same books i: 1
wanted to run: 1
quietly when i: 1
they thought it: 1
coughed loudly and: 1
may not allow: 1
performance which is: 1
ambition from the: 1
i must protest: 1
had seen on: 1
so professor quirrell: 1
why does that: 1
his face that: 1
is evident to: 1
mr potter went: 1
and other substances: 1
your ambition is: 1
dumb or anything: 1
unbreakable vow to: 1
back to harry: 1
begin to cover: 1
said the moment: 1
mr potter can: 1
that what you're: 1
from something that: 1
people give names: 1
parents' disapproval does: 1
extremely expensive as: 1
book that my: 1
have had secret: 1
quirrell's snacks -: 1
how perfectly it: 1
company it's fine: 1
last thing he: 1
sharply at dumbledore: 1
do not come: 1
back by the: 1
another skillful legilimens: 1
and i held: 1
compromise was your: 1
rowling should be: 1
lay on the: 1
quite enough for: 1
have taken an: 1
attentions professor quirrell's: 1
was trying to: 1
considering that it'd: 1
win harry said: 1
hurry up on: 1
as professor quirrell: 1
quirrell stood in: 1
seen from him: 1
on his cheek: 1
see to it: 1
wouldn't believe him: 1
back and kicked: 1
the universe -: 1
plausible deniability it: 1
never met one: 1
stood unsupported against: 1
wars said harry: 1
yourself or you: 1
the lost points: 1
vaporize steel into: 1
get hurt surely: 1
phoenix song but: 1
lamb and thin-sliced: 1
if nothing else: 1
so your secret: 1
word of advice: 1
headmaster of hogwarts: 1
bright and unwavering: 1
went through to: 1
keep on running: 1
shoes - imagine: 1
regarding him with: 1
of quiet bitter: 1
nothing there was: 1
anyway but the: 1
a knock at: 1
have all these: 1
find our sun: 1
but professor quirrell: 1
now with a: 1
of an endless: 1
work with that: 1
this is a: 1
quirrell you can: 1
to be his: 1
quite intrigued which: 1
and use that: 1
harry's vision adjusted: 1
for the love: 1
quirrell paused and: 1
thirteen-year-old and i: 1
truly was a: 1
a true image: 1
of marble on: 1
thing as a: 1
there was that: 1
trajectories that took: 1
the spell again: 1
with satisfaction believe: 1
magical powers when: 1
down blah blah: 1
know that and: 1
was just waiting: 1
you may indeed: 1
of heading down: 1
in a white: 1
make our own: 1
to harry scrutinizing: 1
leaving the solar: 1
chocolate and other: 1
there was there: 1
your classmates would: 1
think of anything: 1
almost shouting now: 1
and classmates that: 1
all do what: 1
you lunatic after: 1
power to rewrite: 1
head unspeakable or: 1
um he organized: 1
about the universe: 1
harry something flickered: 1
even though i: 1
is my own: 1
to have already: 1
mr potter's tutoring: 1
can work on: 1
on making him: 1
harry there's more: 1
first year of: 1
i was trying: 1
to fix it: 1
where he lay: 1
and the manner: 1
up which was: 1
put a golden: 1
shalt not become: 1
man had you: 1
the milky way: 1
my students the: 1
minutes do not: 1
not to do: 1
infinite and empty: 1
not mistake me: 1
quirrell feel it: 1
said trying to: 1
yet the universe: 1
heading down the: 1
with me isn't: 1
guess would be: 1
quirrell with a: 1
something that would: 1
i have a: 1
he would not: 1
i am about: 1
some objections to: 1
point of awareness: 1
them necessary if: 1
confusion why would: 1
i read it: 1
quirrell it's a: 1
was the rational: 1
graded on the: 1
but it's hard: 1
quirrell said smiling: 1
indignation on his: 1
i am sorry: 1
the hands of: 1
door and saw: 1
be worth considering: 1
fifteen minutes do: 1
little spell on: 1
i asked you: 1
you saw no: 1
you credit as: 1
talk to you: 1
up never mind: 1
please do not: 1
as i know: 1
unless i went: 1
and thin-sliced broccoli: 1
triumph anti-dark-lord-harry program: 1
was staring sharply: 1
you will pay: 1
an awareness of: 1
you have now: 1
his head firmly: 1
year of muggle: 1
need not fear: 1
stared at dumbledore: 1
while the scope: 1
those bullies today: 1
a lovely little: 1
that wanted to: 1
its first prank: 1
potions he'd left: 1
his fingers rubbed: 1
you are accustomed: 1
not just confess: 1
i'm sorry said: 1
it refused to: 1
do sometimes people: 1
been said in: 1
stronger and sharper: 1
hogwarts in five: 1
looking at professor: 1
was how you: 1
lord said professor: 1
it as long: 1
any harm and: 1
do anything i: 1
not share with: 1
just about the: 1
was no earth: 1
lab coat doing: 1
and the best: 1
harry said being: 1
down on the: 1
should have formed: 1
distant arches of: 1
for evil explained: 1
if this is: 1
meant to be: 1
you stay long: 1
for a long: 1
worth of information: 1
weapons didn't keep: 1
my mysterious dark: 1
true image tears: 1
harry was starting: 1
me for a: 1
mean that people: 1
dumbledore looked at: 1
their hinges and: 1
more or less: 1
potter i confess: 1
him somehow harry: 1
out as soon: 1
me because i: 1
able to focus: 1
that he forbade: 1
would also be: 1
maintaining look only: 1
honest reply why: 1
there's more to: 1
i prefer to: 1
the classroom returned: 1
in the same: 1
thin-sliced broccoli when: 1
that obvious blah: 1
he could come: 1
in my first: 1
dark lord would: 1
become a point: 1
i know you: 1
stop being grateful: 1
of thirty-seven things: 1
then while i: 1
that thought a: 1
they will end: 1
to not be: 1
lord is to: 1
have said yes: 1
lasted just exactly: 1
hurt people said: 1
my dark side: 1
professor quirrell -: 1
him which could: 1
with frightening precision: 1
becoming the next: 1
seem like the: 1
it was how: 1
escape this planet: 1
nasa and cast: 1
its launch but: 1
with a high-pitched: 1
lesson and professor: 1
quirrell locked eyes: 1
each session immediately: 1
are seals you: 1
teaching him how: 1
far away harry: 1
important life skill: 1
stupid question mr: 1
me think about: 1
slytherin i was: 1
it is to: 1
i resolved my: 1
came closer to: 1
convince me that: 1
once harry said: 1
say professor quirrell: 1
out like that: 1
found himself suddenly: 1
days in a: 1
part of him: 1
of the spell: 1
potter was able: 1
i think i: 1
that it'd taken: 1
shock none of: 1
anyway once we: 1
to get him: 1
secret is safe: 1
volunteer dying of: 1
arts regardless of: 1
about mr potter: 1
your own said: 1
that path the: 1
long time though: 1
sometimes it would: 1
follow the whole: 1
for any traps: 1
fool muggles will: 1
that had escaped: 1
quirrell's face was: 1
over said professor: 1
their grad students: 1
it was the: 1
program too at: 1
the door what: 1
and so i: 1
smiling they both: 1
spell not on: 1
stronger we become: 1
think of it: 1
lord was such: 1
quirinus quirrell until: 1
weapons from anyone: 1
long ago and: 1
not interact with: 1
now made it: 1
ever have come: 1
way of looking: 1
an endless field: 1
no moon no: 1
improbable that someone: 1
had been placed: 1
it takes a: 1
though it felt: 1
you but on: 1
you-know-who there was: 1
was as close: 1
morning i must: 1
a short radius: 1
in his moral: 1
play in order: 1
walking a bit: 1
our sun in: 1
is too perfect: 1
deniability it had: 1
harry said in: 1
common professor quirrell: 1
on professor quirrell's: 1
accept my dominance: 1
someone would be: 1
professor mcgonagall was: 1
invented some simple: 1
harry wasn't a: 1
around you being: 1
had apparently worked: 1
harry to understand: 1
imagine yourself in: 1
time i cast: 1
service you don't: 1
seems unusually hateful: 1
and truly was: 1
an unbreakable vow: 1
mcgonagall was able: 1
it's an actual: 1
about this he: 1
keep the secret: 1
would get improbable: 1
exists and yet: 1
professor quirrell yes: 1
fall for any: 1
it's only just: 1
to anyone with: 1
incalculable there was: 1
know where it's: 1
and thought students: 1
feeling again thou: 1
and then professor: 1
mean that if: 1
the fools who: 1
hope you will: 1
we are to: 1
mr potter tell: 1
evidence explained to: 1
i knew the: 1
terrible dark wizards: 1
confess said professor: 1
me asked harry: 1
appropriate said professor: 1
the lesser perils: 1
perfectly clear in: 1
end up as: 1
that if they: 1
i decided it: 1
went through my: 1
think i -: 1
classmates that he: 1
corrupt me so: 1
of it harry: 1
only want to: 1
at gringotts to: 1
adjusted to the: 1
dry smile i: 1
point no headmaster: 1
had grown up: 1
quiet bitter intensity: 1
when she wouldn't: 1
quirrell it's the: 1
on which you: 1
not think so: 1
it had never: 1
hat's choice for: 1
over both snape: 1
that someone would: 1
the path to: 1
him that nuclear: 1
did not just: 1
considerations if they: 1
however as he: 1
either way there: 1
potter he passed: 1
are accustomed to: 1
see it once: 1
got it got: 1
don't like science: 1
i hope you: 1
possible that you: 1
look of such: 1
be the next: 1
to him before: 1
not happy with: 1
desires well obviously: 1
things i checked: 1
way it works: 1
there were times: 1
what had just: 1
said he peered: 1
friend your first: 1
of your ambition: 1
harry opened the: 1
register harry he: 1
few rare teachers: 1
pass between them: 1
i am maintaining: 1
you to abandon: 1
to suppress his: 1
didn't say it: 1
disorientation in harry's: 1
like science harry: 1
which you stood: 1
under the constant: 1
to be obliviated: 1
a while -: 1
the time there: 1
quirrell wouldn't believe: 1
i have to: 1
back on the: 1
had passed his: 1
been i cannot: 1
some said professor: 1
be a nuclear: 1
that would convince: 1
occasions dumbledore said: 1
their enemies it: 1
of circumstances students: 1
for words and: 1
this was going: 1
keep quiet about: 1
see how the: 1
potter does you: 1
trifle too much: 1
into the wild: 1
time in a: 1
slight pause forgive: 1
privacy on future: 1
before they blow: 1
cast that spell: 1
and clever way: 1
from the mind: 1
imagine what that: 1
or you found: 1
works now there: 1
i will end: 1
me to show: 1
to him either: 1
professor quirrell's hand: 1
conspiracy of silence: 1
quirrell had heard: 1
fan of the: 1
have your oath: 1
as they were: 1
him back that: 1
you being a: 1
shutting down no: 1
school someone tried: 1
soft bed that: 1
nodded he knew: 1
pause forgive me: 1
shrugged pardon me: 1
to control his: 1
a scientist said: 1
that's only if: 1
act more or: 1
smiled dumbledore's long: 1
the moment dumbledore: 1
them away frantically: 1
a young child: 1
of leaning on: 1
was still on: 1
in my place: 1
know that the: 1
the wild the: 1
peered closely at: 1
they blow it: 1
in the end: 1
escaped into the: 1
your wanting it: 1
made and it: 1
moral system that: 1
amounts for me: 1
happened earlier he: 1
fly by different: 1
at the moment: 1
have you done: 1
you harry laughed: 1
seems perfectly clear: 1
will find nothing: 1
on rats of: 1
through my life: 1
benefit from the: 1
had accused harry: 1
stay here awhile: 1
up on becoming: 1
grad students is: 1
long as i: 1
wham professor quirrell's: 1
dark wizards know: 1
to be quite: 1
powerful spell not: 1
it up harry: 1
only a slight: 1
a mere student: 1
afterward you have: 1
what's wrong with: 1
it's hard and: 1
the intelligence and: 1
to hurt people: 1
rule over a: 1
the scope of: 1
when i discovered: 1
if professor quirrell: 1
did you stay: 1
any traps that: 1
today what harry: 1
the last thing: 1
really think i: 1
insight of salazar: 1
lot longer than: 1
one way or: 1
tried to sleep: 1
tell me honestly: 1
probably said professor: 1
it out like: 1
what they want: 1
you're a fool: 1
stars were no: 1
scientist repeated professor: 1
looked terribly terribly: 1
them if you: 1
nothing and that: 1
the eager little: 1
looking but he: 1
same what the: 1
and then stand: 1
the discipline to: 1
to determine if: 1
them the likelihood: 1
has the power: 1
fool harry potter: 1
enough times to: 1
some surprise although: 1
do just as: 1
actual proof steps: 1
enemies it is: 1
snuck into nasa: 1
of incredibly destructive: 1
already visible as: 1
you hear one: 1
wasn't willing to: 1
i subscribe to: 1
between the representativeness: 1
into a cat: 1
would fly by: 1
i will even: 1
lovely little spell: 1
still sometimes when: 1
heap of trouble: 1
focus funny how: 1
radius around harry's: 1
marble in a: 1
'don't brag' -: 1
that was one: 1
me for one: 1
helpless feeling again: 1
indeed so consider: 1
several bodylengths away: 1
he could hear: 1
unimaginable realm beyond: 1
sure their ghost: 1
day headmaster did: 1
was now very: 1
nothing in the: 1
so i am: 1
each other well: 1
had heard and: 1
you stood and: 1
must not interact: 1
slytherins that he: 1
quirrell did the: 1
harry was feeling: 1
very very far: 1
do and if: 1
to rewrite reality: 1
you snapped your: 1
muggle bulletin which: 1
end all of: 1
to confirm his: 1
what that place: 1
won't talk with: 1
do any harm: 1
me that impulse: 1
terribly bright and: 1
that jinx on: 1
be really good: 1
was all i: 1
away harry kept: 1
said so that's: 1
all the other: 1
i shall achieve: 1
once i did: 1
quirrell i hope: 1
more concerned headmaster: 1
services are extremely: 1
was no sky: 1
long as possible: 1
sometimes we make: 1
for disputing it: 1
ceilings vanished harry: 1
had to work: 1
nodded a scientist: 1
heap of ash: 1
would be beaten: 1
be one mr: 1
just how much: 1
have been i: 1
to convince his: 1
not touch the: 1
harry had been: 1
eight hundred years: 1
turned an existing: 1
how harry's brain: 1
me to teach: 1
i confess said: 1
interact with the: 1
understand but his: 1
system that it: 1
fifteen minutes and: 1
defense professor has: 1
to be one: 1
not those fool: 1
am going to: 1
and the amazing: 1
running never shutting: 1
with that but: 1
his eyes he: 1
touch the boundaries: 1
turned upon harry: 1
you win harry: 1
admission mr potter: 1
good people exist: 1
to themselves they: 1
until after harry: 1
that act more: 1
the school psychologist: 1
holographic message like: 1
i slept for: 1
potter but in: 1
quirrell's face mr: 1
is to be: 1
of the first: 1
either can i: 1
seem to be: 1
one that had: 1
offered you to: 1
quite a lot: 1
again harry said: 1
looked at professor: 1
of anything to: 1
somehow harry managed: 1
inform madam pince: 1
harry's heart like: 1
not become a: 1
- the old: 1
only in my: 1
harry seemed like: 1
will even if: 1
side and not: 1
now there was: 1
oh said harry: 1
this the wrong: 1
certain connections -: 1
11 would also: 1
would be wrong: 1
manager at gringotts: 1
wish also harry: 1
discovered your secret: 1
the library section: 1
perils early on: 1
vision the stars: 1
genuine indignation on: 1
he could put: 1
hogwarts and you: 1
awareness of how: 1
knowable guess would: 1
they done for: 1
this as the: 1
harry started to: 1
of disconcertment crossed: 1
mr potter was: 1
down the path: 1
space so they: 1
such services do: 1
who lacks the: 1
to rats hey: 1
tapped a finger: 1
harry nodded he: 1
your dark side: 1
their friends that: 1
idiot muggles can't: 1
scrutinizing your color: 1
seem to have: 1
your color looks: 1
the ambition which: 1
harry said my: 1
seals you do: 1
ears and mind: 1
i last dumbledore: 1
would not benefit: 1
- professor quirrell: 1
both laughed but: 1
ravenclaw mr potter: 1
happened when he: 1
wouldn't like what: 1
other place far: 1
both laughed then: 1
sense said the: 1
in the plaque: 1
right away -: 1
alone anyone as: 1
wrong if you: 1
of the probes: 1
- harry stopped: 1
her point no: 1
of mind which: 1
is there any: 1
will end it: 1
sudden confusion why: 1
professor quirrell coughed: 1
least bit guilty: 1
- headmaster harry: 1
this for some: 1
you cast the: 1
he ever learned: 1
you guess what: 1
they told their: 1
recommend a neutral: 1
what satisfies the: 1
someone doesn't mean: 1
you an irrelevant: 1
had he asked: 1
tutoring by a: 1
observed professor quirrell: 1
isn't that i: 1
wasn't expecting them: 1
bitter intensity you're: 1
harry stood on: 1
and if i: 1
still dumbledore looked: 1
other substances dusted: 1
mr potter while: 1
use the power: 1
no harry said: 1
was enough he: 1
ago and i: 1
to a halt: 1
from the door: 1
that matter to: 1
five decades i: 1
in control by: 1
least since as: 1
decided it was: 1
be the best: 1
those idiot muggles: 1
to defend yourself: 1
was no way: 1
lot of innocent: 1
afraid it takes: 1
said his grin: 1
your first mentor: 1
was my goal: 1
was a rather: 1
cast you must: 1
that harry's ears: 1
said he favored: 1
and you are: 1
mr potter's mind: 1
there any sort: 1
that the answer: 1
he forbade you: 1
would not miss: 1
ensure you wouldn't: 1
anyway and i: 1
get there even: 1
occlumency said dumbledore: 1
know that was: 1
path of a: 1
wish him to: 1
considerations professor quirrell: 1
place as before: 1
about deep-fried lamb: 1
soon as you: 1
there he'd eaten: 1
new ideas down: 1
after the events: 1
rather different way: 1
with it had: 1
yes harry said: 1
might be and: 1
well know and: 1
my parents wouldn't: 1
point in becoming: 1
about such things: 1
show you to: 1
am maintaining look: 1
there was genuine: 1
kill which as: 1
and to become: 1
not be dark: 1
sorted into ravenclaw: 1
he'd just turned: 1
pardon me professor: 1
and unwavering there: 1
less to keep: 1
he wouldn't have: 1
dark side is: 1
if there's any: 1
problem like the: 1
very serious and: 1
with countless tiny: 1
by a wizard: 1
you truly do: 1
and had he: 1
around harry's feet: 1
harry honestly didn't: 1
professor quirrell locked: 1
amounts of money: 1
not benefit from: 1
was gone not: 1
wrong anyway can: 1
quirrell said who: 1
get hurt harry: 1
turned serious again: 1
of salazar himself: 1
am rather more: 1
ask his account: 1
perhaps it might: 1
insist that mr: 1
of money quickly: 1
eventually harry opened: 1
my parents took: 1
case mr potter: 1
of kindly forgiveness: 1
snuck them into: 1
occlumency will you: 1
true ambition may: 1
stage to professor: 1
only imagine what: 1
can just as: 1
looked you should: 1
approve of said: 1
ask you never: 1
and yet the: 1
me to cast: 1
whether or not: 1
anyone not smart: 1
his goal was: 1
stared up at: 1
as it took: 1
recognized professor quirrell: 1
to know about: 1
points of perfect: 1
does you credit: 1
their feet on: 1
circle of white: 1
sighed i suppose: 1
she wouldn't accept: 1
hundred years while: 1
closer to harry: 1
the amazing thing: 1
make sure their: 1
him how to: 1
the ceiling it: 1
just recently that: 1
on running and: 1
notice that it's: 1
knew the way: 1
my parents died: 1
some ideas for: 1
an actual you: 1
requiring a human: 1
i will happily: 1
weak point and: 1
will lose him: 1
slytherins has the: 1
led to his: 1
when this flawed: 1
then the stars: 1
you for wanting: 1
for ravenclaw or: 1
blah appeal to: 1
honestly didn't know: 1
stood and your: 1
time though it: 1
that's the problem: 1
of perfect light: 1
we become what: 1
you to give: 1
by surprise fifty-one: 1
muggles will kill: 1
is to betray: 1
but to learn: 1
students saying that: 1
had entered the: 1
that idea please: 1
was a trifle: 1
minute for harry: 1
room from where: 1
do on your: 1
is economical at: 1
me stay here: 1
feeling of complete: 1
way that harry: 1
power of science: 1
powerful wizard knows: 1
at least we: 1
wonder why you: 1
professor quirrell to: 1
but when i: 1
of you and: 1
quirrell but we're: 1
your own honest: 1
really good i: 1
to repeat what: 1
hidden secrets of: 1
must also insist: 1
today's events are: 1
do not mistake: 1
the import of: 1
what you're about: 1
you had been: 1
new idea to: 1
outright amused i: 1
unimportant things that: 1
waiting several bodylengths: 1
science passed down: 1
tones headmaster thank: 1
was one of: 1
earn back the: 1
said something that: 1
stand up which: 1
message like in: 1
leave of you: 1
to learn martial: 1
him less for: 1
the manner in: 1
me harry said: 1
a moment then: 1
have had masks: 1
no longer tiny: 1
whisper please let: 1
for you harry: 1
describe the actual: 1
if not your: 1
traces which another: 1
connections - professor: 1
matter of public: 1
amazing thing about: 1
light against perfect: 1
entered the potions: 1
nothing else would: 1
our own phoenix: 1
can't even imagine: 1
which shone the: 1
leaning harder on: 1
a woman and: 1
rule two -: 1
everyone around you: 1
lunch today what: 1
and your oath: 1
last dumbledore sighed: 1
that dumbledore decided: 1
run away screaming: 1
of your parents': 1
cheek looking thoughtful: 1
you heard of: 1
ambition may i: 1
taken less than: 1
in star wars: 1
could be the: 1
will address him: 1
to look abashed: 1
hurt get hurt: 1
and running never: 1
of my free: 1
standing around fifty: 1
hard upon his: 1
day his goal: 1
in some surprise: 1
look he had: 1
take pictures two: 1
moments of silence: 1
in your mind: 1
not perfect mr: 1
everything gets cold: 1
to go through: 1
progress on space: 1
because i want: 1
paused and try: 1
diminished as he: 1
thought went through: 1
the headmaster of: 1
have any super: 1
lunatic after today: 1
way for the: 1
this morning i: 1
of professor quirrell's: 1
figure it out: 1
arts and yet: 1
that my dark: 1
public notice you: 1
a thirteen-year-old and: 1
had grown stronger: 1
the appropriate tone: 1
to hear about: 1
down hard upon: 1
quirrell said in: 1
strange expression was: 1
you included a: 1
quirrell said it: 1
quite evident and: 1
seemed like nothing: 1
blinked again is: 1
tension diminished as: 1
of yourself or: 1
convince his teacher: 1
have formed a: 1
have now made: 1
satisfaction so you: 1
dark lord put: 1
or not i: 1
he heard professor: 1
it is the: 1
dumbledore said he: 1
to show you: 1
at least since: 1
up in the: 1
of earth here: 1
how tired it: 1
perspicacious of you: 1
fix it harry: 1
else would they: 1
person in the: 1
receive instruction in: 1
lord would mean: 1
exactly as long: 1
just raise your: 1
free services you: 1
you had to: 1
power for good: 1
classmates would see: 1
thank you quirinus: 1
and i was: 1
the floor staring: 1
stupider but it: 1
everything seems perfectly: 1
loudly and deliberately: 1
the headmaster stared: 1
even though his: 1
lies not in: 1
universe is so: 1
him a particular: 1
saying that this: 1
satisfies the preferences: 1
what i am: 1
older slytherins that: 1
be and if: 1
but that doesn't: 1
blah blah so: 1
i wonder what: 1
checked professor quirrell: 1
quirrell said there: 1
i only want: 1
the universe apply: 1
the now-deserted stage: 1
across the marble: 1
that you saw: 1
the final compromise: 1
threat of annihilation: 1
think that it: 1
didn't hear about: 1
be dragging their: 1
off that path: 1
a volunteer dying: 1
be a dark: 1
and ceilings vanished: 1
destructive secrets which: 1
the list of: 1
my traps less: 1
representativeness heuristic and: 1
feet taller i: 1
everyone you're not: 1
no surrounding sphere: 1
upon his face: 1
minutes and then: 1
so small as: 1
a man and: 1
there is preliminary: 1
a fool either: 1
your promise and: 1
hear about pioneer: 1
way or another: 1
in register harry: 1
spell to make: 1
simply 'don't brag': 1
never do as: 1
vanished harry stood: 1
instead of leaning: 1
except to determine: 1
for harry potter: 1
you have for: 1
quirrell now with: 1
it had been: 1
side there was: 1
only get worse: 1
wouldn't let me: 1
had yet seen: 1
stay long enough: 1
that it was: 1
said to professor: 1
quirrell he was: 1
hard however as: 1
told their fool: 1
enough to be: 1
students is how: 1
taller i thought: 1
for good you're: 1
his nose i: 1
your secret i: 1
no way to: 1
on the portable: 1
that even the: 1
them harry honestly: 1
see the act: 1
certainly be classified: 1
to come out: 1
surge of kindly: 1
complete helplessness professor: 1
use that power: 1
and not because: 1
how could we: 1
professor quirrell professor: 1
professor quirrell consider: 1
are we talking: 1
just confess to: 1
science than that: 1
it you wanted: 1
anything and i've: 1
privacy mr potter: 1
of triumph anti-dark-lord-harry: 1
that was my: 1
the voice then: 1
and you and: 1
to my own: 1
to cover it: 1
hat would say: 1
to harry i: 1
before where harry: 1
harry had to: 1
lesson harry had: 1
his voice was: 1
the toilet the: 1
on earth mr: 1
wiped them away: 1
quirrell to harry: 1
straight instead of: 1
slowly dumbledore's expression: 1
grin the widest: 1
the best of: 1
desk which professor: 1
to be by: 1
that obvious to: 1
barked professor quirrell: 1
but on the: 1
and departed walking: 1
words and then: 1
harry had entered: 1
i have never: 1
i was going: 1
lord if i: 1
the good is: 1
lose him and: 1
dusted with sparkling: 1
in the solar: 1
a stupid question: 1
kindness which sheltered: 1
on that lovely: 1
marble floor with: 1
of you then: 1
mentor then one: 1
would mean that: 1
said slowly something: 1
they were in: 1
voice harry approached: 1
you talking about: 1
flushing new ideas: 1
my free services: 1
events are her: 1
quirrell it happens: 1
manner in which: 1
that a young: 1
back the hands: 1
a bit slowly: 1
you are a: 1
you never to: 1
amused i suppose: 1
at harry it: 1
trained yes that: 1
got stupider but: 1
- mr potter: 1
did seem to: 1
professor quirrell feel: 1
world seems unusually: 1
looked for mr: 1
space travel i: 1
likely you have: 1
what happened when: 1
weapons was the: 1
one to become: 1
is not the: 1
a pause your: 1
complaining - you: 1
want to impress: 1
then the heavy: 1
and the classroom: 1
did the right: 1
lost here what: 1
eaten quite a: 1
the greatest fighting: 1
through the power: 1
at the gray: 1
he said slowly: 1
proof steps um: 1
eyes and something: 1
died in an: 1
me but professor: 1
and perhaps it: 1
said they were: 1
travel said professor: 1
child would imagine: 1
any kind of: 1
salazar himself how: 1
desk mr potter: 1
floor and then: 1
doesn't mean that: 1
again thou shalt: 1
said am i: 1
and i asked: 1
then i will: 1
far away where: 1
a great fighting: 1
rats of course: 1
floundered for words: 1
awareness and vanished: 1
to him by: 1
bit slowly can: 1
their ghost ended: 1
tiny holes through: 1
grew sharper i: 1
chuckled not perfect: 1
you might react: 1
nodded puzzled and: 1
both harry and: 1
which was more: 1
harry of heading: 1
reverent but it: 1
- dumbledore was: 1
that bypassed awareness: 1
the other kids: 1
he will have: 1
me about mr: 1
i wonder whether: 1
tiniest smidgin of: 1
lot of professor: 1
can detect that: 1
quite tasty harry: 1
substances dusted with: 1
step one to: 1
have never met: 1
truly do not: 1
they thought i: 1
control by accepting: 1
it got stupider: 1
how to fix: 1
to figure it: 1
students should steer: 1
harry said so: 1
else knows about: 1
a neutral instructor: 1
stars vanished and: 1
least favorite person: 1
me and that: 1
again is there: 1
his nose let: 1
path the path: 1
a vast thundercloud: 1
quirrell's voice grew: 1
on the floor: 1
quirrell was regarding: 1
that was a: 1
look abashed what's: 1
it was easy: 1
you could just: 1
moment when you: 1
had been said: 1
they lacked the: 1
frantically he would: 1
necessary if it's: 1
snape and you: 1
be dark so: 1
knowledge could do: 1
tell me anything: 1
like the results: 1
why not those: 1
let me think: 1
class with the: 1
to fall over: 1
tone for someone: 1
close as he: 1
rather more concerned: 1
classified by the: 1
sorry said professor: 1
time and then: 1
that place might: 1
of a terminal: 1
be beaten for: 1
madam pince that: 1
can think of: 1
i think that: 1
real slytherin dumbledore: 1
need not be: 1
said professor quirrell's: 1
door classes are: 1
to be really: 1
to say in: 1
student you will: 1
sphere only points: 1
the ambition for: 1
serious again the: 1
an ancient and: 1
puzzled and anticipatory: 1
he asked for: 1
story of what: 1
come to a: 1
to imagine what: 1
harry potter does: 1
not only in: 1
said formally i: 1
are to be: 1
do not wish: 1
had been too: 1
fool said professor: 1
once we knew: 1
either this he: 1
as harry's vision: 1
know what's confusing: 1
went to hufflepuff: 1
he wasn't expecting: 1
full minute he: 1
i was sorted: 1
that the final: 1
some stupid water: 1
evidence and the: 1
the problem harry: 1
looks a little: 1
wrong one time: 1
fingers and invented: 1
professor you need: 1
to run away: 1
teach defense at: 1
though his face: 1
plaque on the: 1
words that bypassed: 1
it too they: 1
harry stood in: 1
helplessness professor quirrell: 1
for his concerns: 1
him with one: 1
managed to control: 1
other hand it: 1
when that hand: 1
the current question: 1
will kill us: 1
potter can you: 1
be nothing left: 1
i cast a: 1
explained to him: 1
expressions harry had: 1
weapons professor quirrell: 1
share with anyone: 1
the pattern and: 1
meddling are killed: 1
can't resist meddling: 1
face and his: 1
omnipotent and use: 1
of his nose: 1
best of all: 1
but it seemed: 1
dark lord then: 1
dumbledore ah-hem professor: 1
that you harbor: 1
wish to be: 1
clever way to: 1
ball during recess: 1
resembles on the: 1
marble floor and: 1
in front of: 1
following our desires: 1
world would look: 1
is the headmaster: 1
in silence for: 1
be betrayed in: 1
the headmaster said: 1
interrupted headmaster albus: 1
lord now professor: 1
hands of time: 1
and powerful wizard: 1
bystanders got hurt: 1
where to find: 1
that he is: 1
there would be: 1
seemed appropriate tell: 1
strongly suspect you: 1
it being any: 1
with me for: 1
while it was: 1
as he heard: 1
cover it harry: 1
someday professor quirrell's: 1
to think that: 1
quirrell smiled with: 1
harry and i: 1
minute he used: 1
you seem like: 1
said at once: 1
feel a great: 1
to him that: 1
while i last: 1
ever seen ran: 1
surrounding sphere only: 1
perfect real people: 1
flawed world seems: 1
hand came down: 1
science is how: 1
the headmaster had: 1
why you deem: 1
it'd taken less: 1
precisely said professor: 1
away frantically he: 1
i get angry: 1
in the voice: 1
the actual proof: 1
something you could: 1
first mentor then: 1
idea please be: 1
of what follows: 1
for making large: 1
be by following: 1
just as well: 1
to kill which: 1
which another skillful: 1
wouldn't think about: 1
stupid water blurring: 1
look was that: 1
as he could: 1
cold everything seems: 1
in order to: 1
said my parents: 1
where it's going: 1
as he stared: 1
he showed me: 1
the act sometimes: 1
was that your: 1
all days do: 1
destroyed by the: 1
of thing you: 1
now waiting several: 1
and said something: 1
that but mr: 1
wasn't looking but: 1
the dais and: 1
and try not: 1
quirrell there were: 1
i can't think: 1
said and i: 1
think that what: 1
anything but our: 1
before and he: 1
of chocolate and: 1
harry nodded i'm: 1
suppose i can: 1
he would never: 1
to read he: 1
up on trajectories: 1
voice grew sharper: 1
parents wouldn't let: 1
i should have: 1
or may not: 1
he agree to: 1
the classroom blasted: 1
out of the: 1
you choose this: 1
cast though less: 1
professor mcgonagall that: 1
might have let: 1
done huge amounts: 1
'you win' seems: 1
i suppose i: 1
runs cold everything: 1
in the galaxy: 1
you to ever: 1
by following our: 1
quirrell harry wasn't: 1
seems to store: 1
quirrell his voice: 1
with only a: 1
widest that harry: 1
nuclear physicist the: 1
or did you: 1
at harry's heart: 1
and controlling the: 1
than he had: 1
and that the: 1
will now cast: 1
me for having: 1
that he wouldn't: 1
and now we: 1
a wrench of: 1
about here nuclear: 1
get hurt it: 1
might be interrupted: 1
yes very good: 1
was apparent that: 1
i apologize for: 1
his grin the: 1
said harry medicine: 1
and i am: 1
how the knowledge: 1
wonder what i: 1
teacher when she: 1
hand what harry: 1
kindly forgiveness for: 1
about him somehow: 1
ancient and powerful: 1
just exactly as: 1
we knew each: 1
regularity for decades: 1
violate rule two: 1
invading your mental: 1
voice suddenly sharp: 1
up and graciously: 1
about it until: 1
innocent bystanders got: 1
such services are: 1
wanting it ah: 1
legilimens can detect: 1
with one of: 1
i will inform: 1
keep going and: 1
math teacher when: 1
superiority other people: 1
on earth do: 1
happens when i: 1
strongly recommend that: 1
going to end: 1
from some unimaginable: 1
quirrell in a: 1
you use your: 1
anyone can want: 1
less improbable that: 1
the hat though: 1
a while harry: 1
apply that knowledge: 1
common sense so: 1
in retrospect it's: 1
the insight of: 1
is as you: 1
him by a: 1
or head unspeakable: 1
right hand whether: 1
to prevent you: 1
i consider you: 1
how dare you: 1
doesn't mean my: 1
easy to forget: 1
of magic or: 1
on earth is: 1
and vanished into: 1
would have gotten: 1
exactly what you: 1
but how could: 1
harry said just: 1
dumbledore came closer: 1
salazar ask me: 1
your head is: 1
secret i am: 1
you will address: 1
him of my: 1
of silence professor: 1
to his becoming: 1
for some stupid: 1
do not breach: 1
fire me for: 1
was exactly what: 1
hat tried to: 1
on his head: 1
didn't tell me: 1
to teach defense: 1
me and one: 1
mind as the: 1
of progress on: 1
empty void with: 1
a convincing way: 1
small room from: 1
with the magic: 1
quiet voice harry: 1
it either this: 1
traps less obvious: 1
idea had never: 1
body and become: 1
on the uptake: 1
now-deserted stage to: 1
seemed to pass: 1
find nothing in: 1
get worse with: 1
bit lost here: 1
the headmaster but: 1
i wanted to: 1
can be destroyed: 1
to hurt someone: 1
his moral system: 1
at the distant: 1
hm a portrait: 1
dumbledore after the: 1
likelihood that the: 1
the tension diminished: 1
at harry mr: 1
polite tones headmaster: 1
and mind couldn't: 1
thousand sometimes it: 1
about - oh: 1
never should have: 1
look of disconcertment: 1
boy-who-lived this is: 1
used those perhaps: 1
and feel a: 1
slow on the: 1
white lab coat: 1
good enough for: 1
was a pause: 1
lesser perils early: 1
quirrell quietly and: 1
whole list all: 1
he had earned: 1
a few rare: 1
i do have: 1
but the stars: 1
to everyone around: 1
said his fingers: 1
also be leaving: 1
mouth then closed: 1
maybe you included: 1
so that's how: 1
the results said: 1
first of all: 1
snacks - intricate: 1
extra mass to: 1
the story of: 1
anti-dark-lord-harry program 1: 1
to avoid flushing: 1
to see professor: 1
no professor quirrell: 1
of the small: 1
nothing you can: 1
with experimenting on: 1
unwavering there was: 1
it or not: 1
wrenched at harry's: 1
was intriguing if: 1
have been able: 1
on trajectories that: 1
dignified as professor: 1
heard the first: 1
professor quirrell finally: 1

of trouble you: 1

the alteration for: 1
for a while: 1
harry realized the: 1
i will now: 1
it maintained plausible: 1
which professor quirrell: 1
his desk there: 1
would convince me: 1
about anything important: 1
know that there: 1
yes very perspicacious: 1
down no matter: 1
refine myself and: 1
ghost ended up: 1
floor staring up: 1
by the ministry: 1
rare and powerful: 1
the anti-tampering spells: 1
quirrell professor quirrell: 1
everything professor quirrell: 1
earlier turned upon: 1
is such a: 1
them i'm sorry: 1
us all someday: 1
a wizard but: 1
than it otherwise: 1
program 1 point: 1
abusive professors professor: 1

abused by older: 1
observation confirm your: 1
longer tiny jewels: 1
to say mr: 1
off their hinges: 1
the thirty-seven items: 1

included a holographic: 1
whole human brain's: 1
this time i: 1
hat though i: 1
lord instead i: 1
happily lead the: 1
died because they: 1
have every possible: 1
he said harry: 1
harry stopped feeling: 1
perfect regularity for: 1
a further thought: 1
for mr potter: 1
stand still so: 1
about to have: 1
two of the: 1
did not think: 1
afterward dumbledore was: 1
but the muggles: 1
one you don't: 1
you can't have: 1
high-pitched shriek quirinus: 1
about understanding and: 1
held back by: 1
like the school: 1
teachers to their: 1
on anyone's face: 1
skittered across the: 1
been too slow: 1
the obvious first: 1
was more difficult: 1
my first year: 1
that the stern: 1
this flawed world: 1
my own satisfaction: 1
to the plaque: 1
eyes he wiped: 1
from the scariest: 1
take a long: 1
earned he hadn't: 1
kids didn't bother: 1
this is the: 1
rage upon his: 1
had grown louder: 1
over a list: 1
see which part: 1
he said solemnly: 1
dark arts regardless: 1
in the states: 1
did you storm: 1
would have thought: 1
thing about the: 1
use of me: 1
into nasa i: 1
test that was: 1
age that thought: 1
still be wrong: 1
was easy to: 1
lord then what: 1
plexus which i'd: 1
another you will: 1
no sky above: 1
think you're fine: 1
that you snapped: 1
that the dark: 1
taken an unbreakable: 1
they walked across: 1
simple and clever: 1
harry spoke up: 1
deprived him of: 1
over and over: 1
even imagine it: 1
school i insist: 1
in an accident: 1
how to avoid: 1
seen ran away: 1
part a brief: 1
it's going but: 1
something that harry's: 1
harry said his: 1
appropriate tone for: 1
the dichotomy between: 1
know whether professor: 1
forbade you to: 1
huge amounts for: 1
act lies not: 1
took harry to: 1
still on professor: 1
being a fool: 1
of hogwarts in: 1
wrench of disorientation: 1
it last a: 1
world they both: 1
off but there: 1
be harry stared: 1
slytherin dumbledore came: 1
to think of: 1
thought a true: 1
prank in eight: 1
psychologist said and: 1
how exactly do: 1
has been cast: 1
is nothing you: 1
across his face: 1
dumbledore's long strides: 1
me informed of: 1
refused to switch: 1
as you heard: 1
was hard to: 1
harry said they: 1
now harry's least: 1
follows you have: 1
i need to: 1
as possible this: 1
took me in: 1
was a knock: 1
extra information said: 1
friends that need: 1
and tell you: 1
hogwarts harry opened: 1
of a man: 1
all harry knew: 1
simply was the: 1
never mind then: 1
was it you: 1
had lowered in: 1
said being a: 1
night sky of: 1
would still be: 1
the best knowable: 1
quirrell this is: 1
think about that: 1
your fingers and: 1
him fired eventually: 1
permission you would: 1
was genuine indignation: 1
and learn and: 1
was there really: 1
stood on a: 1
people all do: 1
professor quirrell don't: 1
going to tell: 1
for ravenclaw professor: 1
my back and: 1
was a time: 1
potter i can't: 1
say now if: 1
it an awareness: 1
i will have: 1
looked at the: 1
lie after a: 1
is a part: 1
was starting to: 1
followed by surprise: 1
intention i wonder: 1
reached out and: 1
harry understood then: 1
permit me to: 1
harry had yet: 1
he lay on: 1
a true impulse: 1
things not to: 1
solar plexus which: 1
harry absolutely said: 1
put it on: 1
common sense said: 1
been moving with: 1
don't take this: 1
notice you will: 1
i checked professor: 1
as the role: 1
so consider professor: 1
the thought of: 1
easy to see: 1
is what would: 1
don't see how: 1
his cheek looking: 1
we in space: 1
how much awesome: 1
was calmer or: 1
- and guess: 1
ask me to: 1
was how perfectly: 1
dais and professor: 1
now cast a: 1
not open there: 1
just as i: 1
and that he: 1
sat up professor: 1
have figured it: 1
nodded i'll take: 1
and you seem: 1
kept its usual: 1
said harry there's: 1
finger i suppose: 1
these other people: 1
they both sighed: 1
i can to: 1
be graded on: 1
might exist anyway: 1
vast thundercloud an: 1
i'd read was: 1
ravenclaw or did: 1
to make sure: 1
understand everything important: 1
the universe is: 1
part into a: 1
will only get: 1
there are too: 1
you then said: 1
as a performance: 1
he-who-must-not-be-named never used: 1
hand it is: 1
day and not: 1
potter's tutoring by: 1
so you're saying: 1
i - headmaster: 1
vanished and the: 1
to make my: 1
a small circle: 1
from the alteration: 1
on the answer: 1
did you have: 1
started to say: 1
are a mere: 1
and your friend: 1
i do suggest: 1
terribly far away: 1
thou shalt not: 1
pioneer 11 would: 1
it is their: 1
newspapers about quirinus: 1
to mention harry: 1
have done huge: 1
just waiting to: 1
to keep on: 1
solar system forever: 1
isn't to never: 1
face followed by: 1
the way for: 1
of no such: 1
a heap of: 1
space no said: 1
i think you're: 1
dream about if: 1
formally i had: 1
neutral instructor with: 1
head is so: 1
a big fan: 1
classes are over: 1
used that time: 1
deep-fried lamb and: 1
people would get: 1
discipline to discover: 1
desk there are: 1
and i will: 1
harry realized actually: 1
i shall have: 1
quirrell rubbed his: 1
stopped feeling rather: 1
harry said completing: 1
in which you: 1
percival - harry: 1
let me stay: 1
experimenting on rats: 1
- no harry: 1
upon the hat: 1
wide and perhaps: 1
be obliviated of: 1
cannot seem to: 1
but i don't: 1
heard students saying: 1
smiled tell me: 1
would learn how: 1
at hogwarts that: 1
- thank you: 1
footsteps moving away: 1
launch but when: 1
somehow even though: 1
have the full: 1
spell requiring a: 1
us stand still: 1
you fire me: 1
wherever they lead: 1
the muggles seem: 1
improbable evidence and: 1
hurt those slytherins: 1
immediately see said: 1
we are meant: 1
confirm his mental: 1
that harry recognized: 1
doesn't mean it's: 1
a little sad: 1
then smiled tell: 1
pioneer program harry: 1
nasa i did: 1
bit tired -: 1
have already guessed: 1
and if we: 1
countless tiny holes: 1
to you about: 1
there is nothing: 1
keep your oath: 1
evident and i: 1
to mr potter's: 1
said his mind: 1
waited in silence: 1
harry blinked he'd: 1
wizard blew into: 1
wouldn't be much: 1
and then lay: 1
in sudden confusion: 1
can't think of: 1
from him i: 1
to protect me: 1
to cast though: 1
right - what: 1
then decided to: 1
through which shone: 1
i looked you: 1
now quite evident: 1
easily do it: 1
you don't tell: 1
propose to go: 1
thirty-seven things not: 1
become stronger we: 1
in eight hundred: 1
harry you didn't: 1
for harry to: 1
looking over a: 1
understood with frightening: 1
he was not: 1
not mr potter: 1
departed walking a: 1
also harry said: 1
of silence to: 1
meekly polite tones: 1
we talking about: 1
and yanked harry: 1
didn't add any: 1
books on occlumency: 1
probes with a: 1
of disorientation in: 1
of complete helplessness: 1
all these other: 1
classroom blasted off: 1
such a convincing: 1
the spell professor: 1
as you say: 1
to a real: 1
instruction in occlumency: 1
but mr potter: 1
at harry as: 1
tiny sugar gems: 1
- oh some: 1
i wonder how: 1
quirrell said what: 1
and the secret: 1
enough to hear: 1
did and i: 1
that you hurry: 1
training which you: 1
time to stand: 1
take the shock: 1
done that no: 1
school psychologist said: 1
of course i: 1
know about the: 1
me for it: 1
professor quirrell leaned: 1
moment then smiled: 1
in occlumency will: 1
i see professor: 1
have you heard: 1
it drove me: 1
talking about here: 1
between them if: 1
of information you: 1
your right hand: 1
staring up at: 1
young child would: 1
formed a conspiracy: 1
an obvious theorem: 1
as you seem: 1
sleep harry had: 1
on and the: 1
and somehow remove: 1
can i believe: 1
been beaten and: 1
kicked him in: 1
his mind wobbling: 1
classroom returned i'm: 1
can you cast: 1
anti-tampering spells upon: 1
to utter such: 1
accident there would: 1
not breach the: 1
a cold look: 1
it is less: 1
doors of the: 1
harry rather suspicious: 1
stupid indeed said: 1
circle of marble: 1
short of the: 1
sparkling sprinkles and: 1
midst of an: 1
the stern look: 1
i would know: 1
brighter as harry's: 1
it on his: 1
of exactly those: 1
shone the brilliance: 1
they were good: 1
incredibly destructive secrets: 1
happened you -: 1
and he showed: 1
be heard talking: 1
could hear the: 1
wonder professor quirrell's: 1
the end people: 1
of ash they: 1
understanding and controlling: 1
during recess and: 1
act resembles on: 1
the answer isn't: 1
harry managed a: 1
quirrell but i: 1
that was all: 1
cast a lovely: 1
information to the: 1
and i cast: 1
with me and: 1
be leaving the: 1
stayed constant all: 1
some other place: 1
asking about deep-fried: 1
a nuclear physicist: 1
part of you: 1
of advice there: 1
to becoming a: 1
recommend that you: 1
he favored professor: 1
or not mr: 1
quirrell until i: 1
any sort of: 1
hurt those bullies: 1
quirrell nodded but: 1
quirrell he tapped: 1
should have asked: 1
will not like: 1
it would corrupt: 1
of muggle school: 1
to keep me: 1
only points of: 1
it seemed appropriate: 1
to the library: 1
becoming a copy: 1
teacher and classmates: 1
i would fall: 1
quirrell you win: 1
his becoming a: 1
quirrell anyone can: 1
it has been: 1
you could say: 1
to study and: 1
about the whole: 1
looking outright amused: 1
dumbledore was now: 1
the probes with: 1
it exists and: 1
do approve of: 1
you permit me: 1
had that helpless: 1
nuclear weapons yes: 1
and i bit: 1
collapsing in despair: 1
place - and: 1
the most probable: 1
professor's eyes i: 1
nervous then the: 1
said don't be: 1
quirrell had done: 1
harry explained my: 1
over his face: 1
it is my: 1
i suppose you: 1
people are trying: 1
medicine maybe space: 1
great wash of: 1
away screaming from: 1
louder they will: 1
him afterward you: 1
making large amounts: 1
you would get: 1
going and so: 1
thought was in: 1
people and to: 1
with anyone who: 1
dome as they: 1
own satisfaction so: 1
under enough stress: 1
mcgonagall that i: 1
side but harry: 1
what was the: 1
vengeance was that: 1
become angry but: 1
to follow the: 1
yourself harry nodded: 1
there is such: 1
the tiniest smidgin: 1
beyond in space: 1
it anyway and: 1
to me i'm: 1
in fact professor: 1
lead the way: 1
quiet about abusive: 1
it happens when: 1
to things they: 1
of an act: 1
for you other: 1
the only one: 1
like get hurt: 1
surprise fifty-one points: 1
to store a: 1
would never do: 1
move me more: 1
me to be: 1
spells upon the: 1
not wish him: 1
to their grad: 1
dumbledore had actually: 1
if you truly: 1
you keep your: 1
harry said that: 1
retrospect it's been: 1
of becoming a: 1
accustomed to everyone: 1
with a picture: 1
thirty-seven items on: 1
realized actually i: 1
for your first: 1
quirrell yes harry: 1
a performance which: 1
got it harry: 1
been with me: 1
fighting wizard or: 1
floating in the: 1
services do not: 1
talking about such: 1
put yourself in: 1
now even he-who-must-not-be-named: 1
attackers on the: 1
reported its launch: 1
please let me: 1
- i won't: 1
a bit lost: 1
had come to: 1
- which was: 1
up i have: 1
trying to utter: 1
if he could: 1
on the defense: 1
quirrell was now: 1
scope of your: 1
moral considerations professor: 1
harry the old: 1
apologize for invading: 1
you're fine professor: 1
dark lord did: 1
like a vast: 1
hear one you: 1
will not object: 1
as close as: 1
on occlumency said: 1
can raise my: 1
every powerful wizard: 1
to think i: 1
here there was: 1
traps that obvious: 1
harry but there: 1
but his voice: 1
bother me after: 1
a slight grin: 1
good i subscribe: 1
to harry but: 1
despair without hurting: 1
professors professor quirrell: 1
highly expensive and: 1
place harry said: 1
but good enough: 1
because they were: 1
even if you: 1
this planet before: 1
steer away from: 1
anything to say: 1
he became a: 1
get angry harry: 1
ended up in: 1
you to prevent: 1
a portrait seems: 1
that the good: 1
if they died: 1
to keep going: 1
hear the suppressed: 1
bullies today being: 1
the rational judgment: 1
have to think: 1
actually i think: 1
as well you're: 1
where harry stood: 1
lose professor quirrell: 1
would dream about: 1
out of hogwarts: 1
takes a lot: 1
he'd just had: 1
scariest thing it: 1
that strange expression: 1
is so very: 1
quirrell's hand came: 1
is it what's: 1
icy tones wham: 1
either i'm afraid: 1
confusion lasted just: 1
quirrell stood by: 1
upon his desk: 1
perfectly good people: 1
very far away: 1
nuclear weapons was: 1
yet soft bed: 1
different way of: 1
talk with anyone: 1
lord that's only: 1
may or may: 1
stuff have you: 1
the whole matter: 1
the sort of: 1
how it is: 1
for having discovered: 1
time professor quirrell: 1
mean my wanting: 1
states of mind: 1
head firmly no: 1
he knew exactly: 1
implications so just: 1
know and i: 1
is preliminary training: 1
i understand and: 1
though i myself: 1
not win that: 1
standing up straight: 1
which made harry: 1
obvious theorem in: 1
the parallel right: 1
no headmaster mr: 1
seems appropriate said: 1
never stop being: 1
nodded i'm a: 1
of how your: 1
and his voice: 1
than harry had: 1
to professor quirrell's: 1
awareness which might: 1
up as a: 1
nuclear weapons from: 1
to discover them: 1
a terminal illness: 1
all i looked: 1
was wrong with: 1
right if not: 1
in the first: 1
and your own: 1
after today of: 1
said i will: 1
without it being: 1
about if i: 1
and something seemed: 1
leaned on and: 1
way and i: 1
is the sort: 1
done the same: 1
organized his thoughts: 1
the heavy oaken: 1
were happy about: 1
down the toilet: 1
in a short: 1
time would not: 1
i off the: 1
um people would: 1
apparently worked with: 1
honestly what thought: 1
one is to: 1
to the darkness: 1
convince me because: 1
he was leaning: 1
slowly can you: 1
own honest reply: 1
didn't begin to: 1
mr potter he: 1
i strongly suspect: 1
in a giant: 1
himself suddenly nervous: 1
appropriate tell professor: 1
portrait of yourself: 1
like that professor: 1
we possibly act: 1
maintain it as: 1
prefer to go: 1
such an obvious: 1
said dumbledore there: 1
muggle school someone: 1
in icy tones: 1
my ball during: 1
because of the: 1
not like the: 1
at hogwarts harry: 1
time to get: 1
fool politicians and: 1
sure you did: 1
harry said but: 1
on your own: 1
are meant to: 1
of light and: 1
heuristic and the: 1
forgive their enemies: 1
other people done: 1
betray that professor: 1
i was teaching: 1
is not only: 1
very very wide: 1
on his face: 1
like the person: 1
anything it's easy: 1
potter said the: 1
obvious said professor: 1
there might be: 1
are you talking: 1
bit guilty about: 1
go about understanding: 1
less obvious said: 1
strangest expressions harry: 1
answer i only: 1
bed that had: 1
over harry nodded: 1
already guessed that: 1
lord you decided: 1
now if he: 1
around as subtle: 1
of public service: 1
only ever see: 1
to have company: 1
about the last: 1
door what on: 1
left to stop: 1
star-gazing interrupted headmaster: 1
and showing where: 1
while - in: 1
quirrell i will: 1
go with the: 1
obvious first of: 1
to obtain books: 1
have done i: 1
the role to: 1
realized the implications: 1
what thought went: 1
and not tomorrow: 1
and not just: 1
he had earlier: 1
her work just: 1
and empty void: 1
said slowly if: 1
if i knew: 1
life without attracting: 1
harry's least favorite: 1
suggest that you: 1
grown louder they: 1
in any case: 1
and refine myself: 1
to collapsing in: 1
smile i know: 1
first professor quirrell: 1
themselves every powerful: 1
if he'd just: 1
stood in the: 1
returned i'm sorry: 1
that was how: 1
think the story: 1
oh now that: 1
to say 'you: 1
harry scrutinizing your: 1
worked with perfect: 1
human brain's worth: 1
sounding as if: 1
precision and reached: 1
does that mean: 1
you're welcome said: 1
back the lost: 1
that need not: 1
such a transparent: 1
to the way: 1
be quite tasty: 1
- no professor: 1
professor quirrell paused: 1
hard and you: 1
become what we: 1
it happens that: 1
was wrong but: 1
it would take: 1
those perhaps because: 1
guilty about it: 1
he was quite: 1
so i usually: 1
if i only: 1
face was now: 1
moving with all: 1
how on earth: 1
you need not: 1
what you're seeing: 1
not stand up: 1
to lose professor: 1
and understood with: 1
was long ago: 1
said i prefer: 1
ever get him: 1
could we possibly: 1
to play in: 1
for all harry: 1
without attracting public: 1
away rotating into: 1
completing the pattern: 1
both laughed a: 1
a full minute: 1
they never should: 1
enough he would: 1
your true ambition: 1
nose let me: 1
i want to: 1
dark not -: 1
and reverent but: 1
to sleep harry: 1
feeling of triumph: 1
learn potions he'd: 1
come cheaply dumbledore: 1
and invented some: 1
perfect light against: 1
mr potter and: 1
voice was sad: 1
harry managed to: 1
light and it: 1
quickly - thank: 1
then one way: 1
kind of admission: 1
just turned into: 1
won't repeat what: 1
his concerns and: 1
take away my: 1
until i decided: 1
i don't have: 1
not just an: 1
mr potter will: 1
it once harry: 1
dumbledore legilimency is: 1
protect his mind: 1
other kids didn't: 1
solar system and: 1
a few moments: 1
exactly the appropriate: 1
- in my: 1
of a dark: 1
intrigued which made: 1
this day and: 1

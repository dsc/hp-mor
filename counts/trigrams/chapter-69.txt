the challenger lies: 1
away daphne greengrass: 1
she'd ended up: 1
than any hex: 1
distant call if: 1
oof said the: 1
of sunshine and: 1
collapsed into her: 1
people who think: 1
she hadn't even: 1
wondering if harry: 1
that bad things: 1
- yes harry: 1
tin which flipped: 1
very simple actually: 1
truly wish to: 1
think of themselves: 1
hands glowing golden-yellowish: 1
and then it: 1
go along and: 1
insult the honor: 1
permission from someone: 1
you had tried: 1
boyish as the: 1
'gryffindor ' she: 1
thing meant you'd: 1
she almost walked: 1
was probably not: 1
and she remembered: 1
a deep breath: 1
knife nervously sawed: 1
door shouted an: 1
i can write: 1
fair if mysterious: 1
hermione had to: 1
like neville of: 1
and another huge: 1
sitting in a: 1
the hex you: 1
over i'm going: 1
exact bundle of: 1
that if he: 1
she approached the: 1
fight to realize: 1
there isn't any: 1
no said harry: 1
as they swam: 1
needed a phoenix: 1
it must have: 1
like that are: 1
even tighter if: 1
her brain as: 1
twelve ' hermione: 1
code-signal - i: 1
heap of unconscious: 1
might know who: 1
if he needed: 1
house of sparklypoo: 1
the question then: 1
was still sitting: 1
that right oh: 1
a tin which: 1
loud silence uh: 1
to think well: 1
to become themselves: 1
too blatant or: 1
sitting up and: 1
the headmaster saying: 1
appear for someone: 1
as being told: 1
keeled over -: 1
of sunshine like: 1
charms class then: 1
a private thing: 1
daily prophet did: 1
of a sudden: 1
the silver-bearded old: 1
fired at unfortunately: 1
stopped she remembered: 1
hogwarts students who'd: 1
door let's see: 1
she said can: 1
you've got to: 1
further into her: 1
although with a: 1
there aren't any: 1

harry i read: 1
before - the: 1
it into tinier: 1
him go on: 1
been expecting to: 1
and adult and: 1
her into this: 1
sparkling head sank: 1
thinking of all: 1
call hermione started: 1
up by being: 1
cast on harry: 1
about it that: 1
go to madam: 1
detect the magic: 1
certain said hermione: 1
threatened the caster: 1
some of the: 1
the evening gloom: 1
the sense of: 1
word i'm sorry: 1
she'd ever felt: 1
fruits or vegetables: 1
lying unconscious as: 1
believe it they: 1
feet turned the: 1
hero or so: 1
then saving someone: 1
middle of a: 1
being referred to: 1
unfortunately casting two: 1
so you will: 1
is meant to: 1
thought it would: 1
to fit into: 1
was probably going: 1
the subject than: 1
frown had been: 1
your thirtieth hero: 1
she heard a: 1
a real girl: 1
by the bright: 1
ate another bite: 1
fit into the: 1
uh said daphne: 1
is hurt i: 1
like i'm an: 1
realize that they: 1
me that question: 1
was only just: 1
fifteen years old: 1
extremely nervous probably: 1
brighter blaze of: 1
- jellyfy yelled: 1
like an image: 1
my dear said: 1
me dumbledore refused: 1
now she -: 1
flipped open to: 1
couch her head: 1
have pushed her: 1
you aimed at: 1
aren't any other: 1
hands and mike: 1
army training she: 1
probably already being: 1
able to figure: 1
and then hermione: 1
a lawful challenge: 1
afterward that a: 1
quite certain said: 1
you should tell: 1
strange smile on: 1
that she was: 1
determination seems unshakeable: 1
of the daily: 1
sunshine general didn't: 1
flooed into the: 1
fun and games: 1
she - stupefy: 1
to her still: 1
be settled by: 1
to dinner the: 1
for her army: 1
then there's no: 1
of hermione standing: 1
what you got': 1
been grim and: 1
robes for his: 1
were her friends: 1
you wanted to: 1
things such as: 1
by being put: 1
to her own: 1
second before calling: 1
up derrick and: 1
that people don't: 1
hear that distant: 1
granger does not: 1
thought the fiery: 1
she heard no: 1
into darkness as: 1
glowing golden-yellowish as: 1
father and nonetheless: 1
until today being: 1
dark lady hey: 1
hadn't actually thought: 1
aren't nearly enough: 1
things professor quirrell: 1
and it occurred: 1
world almost any: 1
hero it was: 1
aren't comfortable with: 1
shouted tracey davis: 1
real shielding charm: 1
said the distant: 1
for someone else: 1
brain as she: 1
and she couldn't: 1
seemed like a: 1
transfer to durmstrang: 1
the windows barely: 1
hermione's face she: 1
boy dropped out: 1
was all right: 1
take this the: 1
guess what now: 1
i thought i'd: 1
is going to: 1
and they were: 1
to be too: 1
flitwick threatened to: 1
that seemed like: 1
the cry the: 1
of a color: 1
it had gone: 1
gasp me she: 1
ron or anything: 1
daphne like sunny: 1
the boy nodded: 1
it was out: 1
attack suddenly made: 1
over to where: 1
princess shouted tracey: 1
say something slytherin: 1
books too no: 1
millicent caught sight: 1
everything was all: 1
give them quests: 1
left and the: 1
dumbledore was just: 1
hight someone knocking: 1
was a good: 1
political mayhem wreaked: 1
and he actually: 1
real heroing the: 1
what you got: 1
games said harry: 1
and hermione wondered: 1
wreaked by her: 1
a difference had: 1
beating the pants: 1
dodged that one: 1
twist and her: 1
because that seemed: 1
was hard even: 1
brighter than any: 1
suddenly made a: 1
blatant or your: 1
his skull where: 1
just how large: 1
but are you: 1
bully-boy as his: 1
from the environment: 1
expecting to hear: 1
statue at the: 1
sane person in: 1
greengrass said the: 1
this any harder: 1
of whispers broke: 1
are and not: 1
she looked at: 1
or anything except: 1
surprised thinking about: 1
for the extra: 1
the one who'd: 1
- hermione stopped: 1
had to come: 1
you don't understand: 1
was very simple: 1
you never even: 1
darkness as they: 1
was of a: 1
was right then: 1
dare you insult: 1
when she heard: 1
terrible brilliance blazing: 1
brain uh what're: 1
a game like: 1
a strange smile: 1
being told that: 1
remembered that if: 1
of crimson stupefy: 1
as his feet: 1
all three although: 1
it turned out: 1
very good ambushes: 1
that they react: 1
news the wizengamot: 1
going on she: 1
potter's love interest: 1
that until she'd: 1
able to detect: 1
cry the call: 1
in gasps as: 1
fight would be: 1
okay said hermione: 1
by the worst: 1
lawful challenge to: 1
way you can: 1
and she'd never: 1
mouth oh i: 1
little faint all: 1
read those books: 1
the bright shine: 1
looked she thought: 1
that was hard: 1
windows barely visible: 1
of that so: 1
said hermione i'm: 1
when professor flitwick: 1
father owled him: 1
off and she: 1
stuff going on: 1
students who'd had: 1
that was -: 1
maybe it didn't: 1
snoring loudly daphne's: 1
granger didn't even: 1
- you just: 1
winked in and: 1
somehow said harry: 1
black waters illuminated: 1
'you are twelve: 1
he didn't and: 1
up surprised that: 1
shine of the: 1
in grownup situations: 1
bright sparks of: 1
as they go: 1
directing her remark: 1
while whenever she: 1
left out the: 1
neck she hadn't: 1
euphoria that hit: 1
uh - she: 1
steak cutting it: 1
until she'd finished: 1
i doubt you: 1
that was a: 1
hand or just: 1
in particular you're: 1
too scared of: 1
got door shouted: 1
still breathing in: 1
it and if: 1
good thing he: 1
suddenly felt almost: 1
she turned to: 1
of chaos or: 1
professor flitwick says: 1
thunk-thunk thunk-thunk-thunk thunk: 1
do what was: 1
a comfortable black: 1
you hear the: 1
and reached inside: 1
if they didn't: 1
go professing being: 1
miss greengrass said: 1
as labour or: 1
thought around fifteen: 1
a shimmering blue: 1
air with a: 1
run with the: 1
she'd finished pouring: 1
boy in yellow: 1
isn't any good: 1
twice and three: 1
miss granger didn't: 1
would be obvious: 1
it ever took: 1
to die wow: 1
in the evening: 1
and started snoring: 1
of the noble: 1
with a terrible: 1
have to do: 1
prophet did you: 1
it or it: 1
yellow lumps she'd: 1
was who she'd: 1
fourth year or: 1
do you ask: 1
snow-topped mountains and: 1
the only sane: 1
as bright and: 1
out where he: 1
over the hufflepuff: 1
for it while: 1
headmistress might catch: 1
a word with: 1
nobody had worked: 1
sparkling jinx and: 1
tears on his: 1
sunny daphne like: 1
harry potter who: 1
that literally felt: 1
in the air: 1
bully-boy cast spells: 1
right i'm michael: 1
issue of the: 1
the door and: 1
you're all okay: 1
wand was in: 1
silence this said: 1
do it or: 1
she sipped from: 1
hero and she's: 1
her face as: 1
head collapsed into: 1
of thing meant: 1
ought to innervate: 1
confused and worried: 1
dear said the: 1
then hermione granger: 1
liking neville being: 1
she was they: 1
had broken something: 1
her mind took: 1
your deputy headmistress: 1
harry potter had: 1
fork and knife: 1
a sick sad: 1
looked extremely nervous: 1
of toast that: 1
hero a hero: 1
all put under: 1
they'd seen her: 1
where the three: 1
wizengamot just ruled: 1
hopkins said the: 1
black leather couch: 1
running like that: 1
is a twelve-year-old: 1
about that brief: 1
from there to: 1
- millicent caught: 1
taught by the: 1
produced as though: 1
thump and the: 1
your fallen allies: 1
if she'd imagined: 1
you know that: 1
many people who: 1
angry roar producing: 1
bit selfish when: 1
predictably to certain: 1
everything up as: 1
shielding charm would: 1
at for example: 1
yeah said hermione: 1
his eyes an: 1
noticed daphne sparkling: 1
bright shine of: 1
and professor flitwick: 1
first day of: 1
reminds me dumbledore: 1
figure out where: 1
so i thought: 1
circle of fear: 1
his mouth oh: 1
would see a: 1
robes already turning: 1
fading into darkness: 1
anti-apparition jinxes and: 1
for her and: 1
the evil was: 1
said daphne what: 1
bundle of political: 1
times she asked: 1
you got then: 1
'heroes' are rare: 1
to the floor: 1
bullies making sure: 1
him to tell: 1
and there aren't: 1
realizing just how: 1
jinx she hadn't: 1
to aim their: 1
hermione granger has: 1
she was probably: 1
or being able: 1
the other two: 1
old and she: 1
now she'd just: 1
little i bet: 1
it was as: 1
and everything was: 1
at the junction: 1
had tried to: 1
hermione realized or: 1
were trying to: 1
solved you know: 1
i was gasp: 1
who'd had years: 1
bluntly me i'm: 1
reached inside his: 1
that if i'm: 1
me i'm quite: 1
it'll stop me: 1
done talking harry: 1
after my family: 1
the ravenclaw table: 1
michael hopkins said: 1
of five slytherin: 1
his wand the: 1
she is a: 1
the junction of: 1
to catch her: 1
cry out when: 1
world channels them: 1
corridor from which: 1
her fingers did: 1
what you've got: 1
whispers probably weren't: 1
a piece of: 1
it seemed a: 1
the three older: 1
who wanted to: 1
of fire just: 1
that thought hermione: 1
gesture before the: 1
on the first: 1
someone knocking bellowed: 1
got to a: 1
mike inside hufflepuff: 1
stop me there: 1
been a muggle: 1
the environment and: 1
i mean how: 1
his hand or: 1
an undistinguished brown: 1
people we call: 1
would have panicked: 1
for someone who: 1
people aren't comfortable: 1
for minerva's brain: 1
when harry had: 1
knees suddenly felt: 1
casting two sleep: 1
bellowed mr goyle: 1
near the door: 1
there's no need: 1
all of professor: 1
just starting to: 1
anything she'd ever: 1
see if you: 1
said harry he: 1
thought came to: 1
which flipped open: 1
anyway now she'd: 1
himself in the: 1
quests it was: 1
he might have: 1
to think didn't: 1
quirrell had said: 1
harry he looked: 1
wish to be: 1
for this albus: 1
if you had: 1
i'd say that: 1
called herself daphne: 1
voice saying 'you: 1
boy nodded pushed: 1
saw the phoenix: 1
but i guess: 1
another one aftermath: 1
there's an authority: 1
oh i know: 1
he was a: 1
to catch your: 1
was a very: 1
crew and his: 1
finished choking on: 1
this year would: 1
place in due: 1
protected now she: 1
bolt blasted toward: 1
evil was that: 1
girl heroes in: 1
and there was: 1
his eyes if: 1
next dark lady: 1
things when the: 1
that somehow seemed: 1
by a surprise: 1
reams of snappy: 1
she could and: 1
at about fourth: 1
people who stopped: 1
general well said: 1
i try to: 1
waiting for someone: 1
saving someone like: 1
right then you: 1
harry said looking: 1
herself freshly toasted: 1
an even brighter: 1
the wrong way: 1
of sparklypoo and: 1
like that was: 1
and it's painful: 1
look at the: 1
up on her: 1
yanked the door: 1
three times she: 1
going to get: 1
realized that the: 1
my legs the: 1
hermione had felt: 1
racing feet turned: 1
a statue at: 1
when she thought: 1
the look on: 1
she served herself: 1
that she liked: 1
would appear for: 1
how hard we: 1
the part about: 1
scared of getting: 1
but he looked: 1
eye that hermione: 1
simple actually you: 1
to realize that: 1
life she turned: 1
even if the: 1
went and beat: 1
that hit her: 1
put in grownup: 1
confident could someone: 1
read history books: 1
had been grim: 1
was out of: 1
then she'd threatened: 1
how to become: 1
and nonetheless daphne: 1
saying that you: 1
he actually dropped: 1
steak and lifted: 1
it occurred to: 1
be playing a: 1
willing to help: 1
said his fork: 1
that doesn't stop: 1
then they will: 1
quite predictably to: 1
before christmas but: 1
her eye that: 1
looked too-adult now: 1
the extra 'm': 1
ravenclaws in hearing: 1
came down to: 1
who was responsible: 1
story it began: 1
brief glow -: 1
to as the: 1
sort of pale: 1
across the table: 1
do your part: 1
far brighter than: 1
hermione standing in: 1
playing quidditch would: 1
have been all: 1
corner of her: 1
them so i: 1
the door let's: 1
this said daphne: 1
the story it: 1
bully shouted protego: 1
ruled that 'let's: 1
can't believe you: 1
headmaster's list and: 1
swayed slightly to: 1
as she crawled: 1
does not do: 1
regurgitate it i: 1
older boys were: 1
were lying unconscious: 1
now granger went: 1
blazing far brighter: 1
grownups have to: 1
don't understand even: 1
some people a: 1
authority watching to: 1
you have dealt: 1
lit harry's face: 1
what hermione told: 1
being harry potter's: 1
that you ought: 1
sawed at a: 1
some cursed sixth-year: 1
hero she should've: 1
most people aren't: 1
you said hermione: 1
then she'd recovered: 1
back at where: 1
okay with that: 1
saw it a: 1
as a sparkling: 1
he was protected: 1
why are you: 1
into the floor: 1
a chance to: 1
a hero then: 1
hermione i'm going: 1
to get hurt: 1
was done talking: 1
didn't mix stupefy: 1
had stood looked: 1
and three helpings: 1
and flooed into: 1
them this is: 1
sunshine yeah she: 1
out the part: 1
daphne was probably: 1
then regurgitate it: 1
someone had added: 1
it hadn't been: 1
by deliberately falling: 1
this she'd been: 1
no nobody else: 1
away from the: 1
she hadn't actually: 1
i'm michael hopkins: 1
make everything up: 1
was another silence: 1
run she ran: 1
flat on her: 1
time i'll -: 1
you there's no: 1
been nearly as: 1
even as she: 1
it was after: 1
hear the news: 1
bad things sometimes: 1
brownies uh -: 1
was they might: 1
open there was: 1
if he was: 1
two bullies were: 1
that moment it: 1
him pretend there: 1
would have come: 1
known how to: 1
the news the: 1
this it isn't: 1
people when she: 1
professors ever to: 1
are ourselves it's: 1
spoke though she: 1
hands sparkling brightly: 1
was in her: 1
euphoria of saving: 1
there had been: 1
and take her: 1
because of that: 1
to gryffindor just: 1
shimmering blue glow: 1
seconds for minerva's: 1
davis leaping off: 1
heroes in them: 1
tell them all: 1
private thing between: 1
and they could: 1
whispers broke out: 1
to ask me: 1
into her glowing: 1
big and they: 1
sure you should: 1
best time to: 1
currently she was: 1
not like i'm: 1
no fire and: 1
'let's see what: 1
albus afteraftermath within: 1
she said i've: 1
had put himself: 1
have her transferred: 1
then it's okay: 1
gasp believe said: 1
madam pomfrey's office: 1
subject than just: 1
as it turned: 1
wand she remembered: 1
boys in green-trimmed: 1
he didn't -: 1
like that if: 1
then someone had: 1
sense of the: 1
miss granger does: 1
- the last: 1
like that in: 1
so long as: 1
about that sort: 1
she needed permission: 1
he looked sort: 1
no fruits or: 1
you even a: 1
sort of thing: 1
was a sunshine: 1
fallen over in: 1
lady hey everyone: 1
looked at the: 1
her that maybe: 1
her general sunshine: 1
thought hermione granger: 1
all of a: 1
just ruled that: 1
thought i'd just: 1
way said harry: 1
a thump and: 1
glisseo said hermione: 1
inside a constraining: 1
he kept it: 1
and the largest: 1
hero then they: 1
of someone else: 1
out how to: 1
no cry and: 1
albus said the: 1
for the promotion: 1
hufflepuff this year: 1
come up with: 1
gasp unjellyfy my: 1
does not fall: 1
phoenix to tell: 1
there was nothing: 1
why do you: 1
bullies were trying: 1
extra 'm' i: 1
illuminated by the: 1
look in his: 1
something like an: 1
as that and: 1
or there's an: 1
and tinier pieces: 1
will not listen: 1
reflected from one: 1
thank you hermione: 1
most ancient duel: 1
probably not the: 1
the first day: 1
surrounded by a: 1
sunshine like neville: 1
with a sick: 1
please - from: 1
if it hadn't: 1
at unfortunately casting: 1
spent a whole: 1
was gone she: 1
caught sight of: 1
like that until: 1
bullies on the: 1
she never saw: 1
thought about it: 1
already being solved: 1
familiar about that: 1
the corner her: 1
hand the sunshine: 1
heroic equality for: 1
sort grownups have: 1
and she said: 1
decided it's not: 1
lips said somnium: 1
actually you just: 1
almost walked away: 1
my name practically: 1
signed up for: 1
shouted protego and: 1
case and then: 1
was - glisseo: 1
harry yeah said: 1
it a reflection: 1
with a sparkling: 1
than anything she'd: 1
not fair if: 1
of sunshine greengrass: 1

barely visible in: 1
tinier pieces i: 1

to get another: 1
dumbledore refused to: 1
under anti-apparition jinxes: 1
along and most: 1
once twice and: 1
someone still hadn't: 1

evening gloom fishes: 1
nonetheless daphne greengrass: 1
he was going: 1
watching to catch: 1
mistakes and make: 1
at that moment: 1
such a thing: 1
dramatically waving an: 1
slytherin boys just: 1
faintly as though: 1
drop she is: 1
was dangling in: 1
or so you: 1
a gasp hero: 1
she'd recovered enough: 1

inside hufflepuff there: 1
year would you: 1
well said hermione: 1

sunshine code-signal -: 1
stuck out his: 1
meant that she: 1
professor mcgonagall's voice: 1

to be my: 1
friends she had: 1
statue had stood: 1
hexes in a: 1
person in hogwarts: 1
students who'd signed: 1
themselves as labour: 1
about that she: 1
grew up by: 1
would've fallen over: 1
feet went out: 1
the black waters: 1
before the counter-jinx: 1
and said that: 1
think well enough: 1
a smile on: 1
able to hit: 1
an answer i: 1
she sat down: 1
playing a game: 1
ended up as: 1
question what makes: 1
a question for: 1
imperfect copy of: 1
absorb all this: 1
they might sneak: 1
five slytherin bullies: 1
the world channels: 1
a four-way branch: 1
with grievous political: 1
the whole scene: 1
began rippling out: 1
as the only: 1
who was dangling: 1
there's no way: 1
in charms class: 1
she realized that: 1
knocking bellowed mr: 1
said tightly staring: 1
to a junction: 1
you were willing: 1
literally felt better: 1
it and she'd: 1
too young or: 1
caster with grievous: 1
twenty-four hours ago: 1
around waiting for: 1
face but he: 1
when she came: 1
said what hermione: 1
wow i can't: 1
about the phoenix: 1
just right for: 1
was protected now: 1
ask harry's fork: 1
she said and: 1
books and there: 1
had rolled back: 1
considered this she'd: 1
five full seconds: 1
whole life she: 1
was such a: 1
had just noticed: 1
catch you albus: 1
had hit her: 1
sank further into: 1
with your thirtieth: 1
it's not like: 1

difference had sprung: 1
lemon drop she: 1
doorway there was: 1
it i mean: 1
hero when harry: 1
mr goyle knocking: 1
all that running: 1
helpings of chocolate: 1
at her across: 1
said anything yet: 1
large a difference: 1
of the question: 1
turned out nobody: 1
she had apparently: 1
harry if miss: 1
still in his: 1
put under anti-apparition: 1
looked at him: 1
wands at her: 1
then she would: 1
crimson stupefy she: 1
same place in: 1
her challenging neville: 1
pieces i think: 1
was suddenly realizing: 1
wonder with a: 1
and didn't say: 1
a junction she: 1
a good thing: 1
direction or another: 1
the phoenix and: 1
door open there: 1
worked right i'm: 1
his robes for: 1
with no visible: 1
the bullies they: 1
nearly as good: 1
again between them: 1
with a thump: 1
lower dorms and: 1
except for the: 1
if mysterious old: 1
feeling a little: 1
many people playing: 1
only just starting: 1
the books warn: 1
someone a hero: 1
to have you: 1
that heroes sat: 1
the noble and: 1
been something familiar: 1
they react quite: 1
forward to where: 1
the whispers probably: 1
too-adult now and: 1
her brain uh: 1
of the sparkly: 1
still smiling hugely: 1
' hermione took: 1
a little faint: 1
smaller boy in: 1
um harry said: 1
a thing as: 1
crimson bolt blasted: 1
old wizards give: 1

the boy once: 1
while she was: 1

muggle hermione realized: 1
said the carrow: 1
he hadn't even: 1
this stuff going: 1
weren't about that: 1
aiming his wand: 1
going to have: 1
it people who: 1

where he'd been: 1
who'd signed up: 1
at the corridor: 1
her whole life: 1
hex that had: 1

time to ask: 1
has decided she's: 1
that in the: 1
harry had finished: 1
how i acted: 1
- from the: 1
that a phoenix: 1
who was feeling: 1
she should've remembered: 1
harry still smiling: 1
hermione granger strolled: 1
fear and she: 1
be sure you: 1
and just say: 1
in the doorway: 1
mikes in all: 1
maybe even gryffindor: 1
to his feet: 1
metal of a: 1
blink when professor: 1
the counter-jinx worked: 1
them into it: 1
quirrell's extra-curricular activities: 1
well enough in: 1
the caster with: 1

two corridors a: 1
with that why: 1
his food some: 1
slytherin bullies and: 1
the statue had: 1
room with her: 1
freshly toasted bread: 1

herself daphne of: 1
how to use: 1
an authority watching: 1
sunshine and blue: 1
even known there: 1
that maybe bullies: 1
training she would've: 1
she heard the: 1
it is better: 1
green-trimmed robes already: 1
of that apparently: 1
simple as that: 1
believe i just: 1
and then regurgitate: 1
you can understand: 1
or liberal democrat: 1
her remark to: 1
constraining circle of: 1
duel meant that: 1
and groaning and: 1
if they had: 1
political beliefs if: 1
heard no cry: 1
they go along: 1
bolt missed because: 1
fought until the: 1
on harry and: 1
that if they'd: 1

of fear and: 1
on hermione's face: 1
weren't any tears: 1
there someplace i: 1
and listening to: 1
take it shouted: 1
general sunshine yeah: 1
trying to catch: 1

that her challenging: 1
that question -: 1
twelve-year-old girl albus: 1
hugely you know: 1

in her brain: 1
into the headmaster's: 1

dropped out of: 1
she shouldn't have: 1
to make everything: 1
you were too: 1
and her lips: 1
by an invisible: 1
no sign she: 1
granger has decided: 1
with that right: 1
and lifted them: 1
- it took: 1
activities and students: 1
mcgonagall's voice saying: 1
his wand she: 1
for long seconds: 1
' she was: 1
huge smile lit: 1
albus dumbledore was: 1

didn't seem to: 1
given that it: 1
that reminds me: 1
said hermione it: 1
only sane person: 1
too far behind: 1
almost any fight: 1
and - and: 1
gold a flash: 1
harry potter's love: 1
that it had: 1
bullies they were: 1
enough for her: 1
the headmaster's list: 1

of hufflepuff this: 1
i think the: 1
frolicking woodland creatures: 1

to correct his: 1
from harry potter: 1
there weren't any: 1
to have her: 1
an angry roar: 1
from a faraway: 1
they came closer: 1

hit you she: 1
eyes if someone: 1
she was trying: 1
though from nowhere: 1
kept it and: 1
to being teased: 1
neville longbottom she'd: 1
she'd been wondering: 1
didn't even blink: 1
that way but: 1
she paused puzzled: 1
on the screens: 1

liberal democrat would: 1
she saw it: 1
and rescued a: 1
pegged him at: 1
very big and: 1
she dodged that: 1
like that she: 1
of unconscious bullies: 1
a glance three: 1
to hermione that: 1
earlier hermione said: 1
to his mouth: 1
ever to go: 1

and not to: 1
one who'd been: 1
rush of euphoria: 1
her breath she: 1
even a little: 1
faster that was: 1
magic involved lemon: 1
on like that: 1
at it and: 1
hermione swayed slightly: 1
stunned three older: 1
looking very confused: 1
or sunny daphne: 1

cutting it into: 1
in muggle britain: 1

sparkling brightly and: 1
in a comfortable: 1
hard we try: 1

visible bolt to: 1
snide remarks about: 1

something slytherin or: 1
a brief sigh: 1
was on the: 1
harry as she: 1
granger strolled away: 1
told the story: 1
the door open: 1
from under him: 1
yet before she: 1
he'd been dropped: 1

as boyish as: 1

that running excuse: 1
sat around waiting: 1
up as the: 1
a phoenix to: 1

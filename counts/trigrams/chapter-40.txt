at all people: 1
professor quirrell still: 1
obligingly across the: 1
a certain useful: 1
something colder more: 1
buying ridiculously expensive: 1
and was deliberately: 1
deathly chill seemed: 1
much like an: 1
the same time: 1
a comed-tea first: 1

a quiet nagging: 1
the tea cup: 1
more natural and: 1
had dropped his: 1

inside his head: 1
cynical yet mr: 1

with that symbol: 1

when harry felt: 1
known to the: 1

taking that into: 1
finished his own: 1
on his coat: 1
cloak and before: 1
away your life: 1
he'd learned by: 1
in a very: 1
defense professor laughed: 1
he frowned dumbledore: 1
mess with him: 1
and something colder: 1
pattern to match: 1
in an afterlife: 1
dumbledore of that: 1
well i take: 1
professor laughed harry: 1
indistinguishable from memory: 1
to a similar: 1
be becoming visible: 1
said as professor: 1
convinced you to: 1
across the long: 1
obvious idea about: 1
in a certain: 1
face then harry: 1
around in atlantis: 1
defense professor lifted: 1
try it there: 1
wanted them then: 1
ordinary professor quirrell: 1
that dumbledore does: 1
exactly correct way: 1
game to take: 1

about the resurrection: 1
great adventure i: 1
like well tea: 1
let it stand: 1
searches for immortality: 1
the world said: 1
his teacup a: 1
professor quirrell's presence: 1
shocked out of: 1
of elaborate snowflakes: 1
it he'd felt: 1
appreciate just to: 1
the wielder -: 1
a cold cold: 1
afterlife what people: 1
of the world: 1
dumbledore's opponent said: 1
of what was: 1
went floating back: 1
it there were: 1
a second i: 1
the existence of: 1
symbol he'd drawn: 1
of his skin: 1
temperature of the: 1
suspect only project: 1
in their searches: 1
unappreciative in fact: 1
nodded and finished: 1
that is the: 1
to him like: 1
voice i find: 1
bill last time: 1
said suddenly is: 1
didn't say 'i: 1
took more long: 1
really believed didn't: 1
take it that: 1
that very calm: 1
tea and the: 1
face that is: 1
the sort which: 1
repeat the chinese: 1
lord malfoy threatened: 1
gave me the: 1
harry put his: 1
his cup to: 1
else i must: 1
wide table that: 1
had made harry: 1
harry nodded the: 1
a faintly blue: 1
to communicate with: 1
said he sipped: 1
up harry had: 1
voice like ice: 1
harry didn't fool: 1
and thoughtful no: 1
like i did: 1
of flowers glimmering: 1
had given up: 1
cold smile on: 1
maneuvered himself into: 1
would - but: 1
was far above: 1
tracery of flowers: 1
and they put: 1
harry's tea-saucer for: 1
those reports whose: 1
should not have: 1
awful it was: 1
- but never: 1
second i should: 1
said harry to: 1
beginning are you: 1
as he shrugged: 1
itself off the: 1
how awful it: 1
to do that: 1
after a while: 1
the alleged spirits: 1
own best guess: 1
hoping it would: 1
in the exactly: 1
still tasted to: 1
the exactly correct: 1
the headmaster believed: 1
in fact maybe: 1
their chessboard all: 1
later the saucer: 1
the problem harry: 1
as well i: 1
no longer trust: 1
quirrell still in: 1
heck no said: 1
the mind the: 1
frustrating as well: 1
could not be: 1
visit to diagon: 1
you perceive said: 1
had tried to: 1
this afternoon harry: 1
blue' your true: 1
death is the: 1
he did so: 1
taking on a: 1
had convinced you: 1
is something else: 1
and lucius sacrifices: 1
his face that: 1
professor quirrell's expression: 1
face was thoughtful: 1
back to harry: 1
lips and something: 1
thinking do you: 1
on the bill: 1
it stand that: 1
it is not: 1
lord malfoy please: 1
professor quirrell though: 1
you heck no: 1
the matter myself: 1
stone harry set: 1
does talk to: 1
wouldn't say no: 1
is blue' your: 1
the ordinary professor: 1
him like well: 1
pronounce or at: 1
couldn't appreciate just: 1
certain useful spell: 1
to cast the: 1
maybe nobody actually: 1
it was clear: 1
toward the defense: 1
problem harry looked: 1
quiet nagging suspicion: 1
chance to try: 1
stuff but that: 1
in front of: 1
you spoke to: 1
i still be: 1
i mean besides: 1
project an image: 1
the table was: 1
inside a circle: 1
harry had chosen: 1
dumbledore have you: 1
the room seemed: 1
game against dumbledore: 1
and it does: 1
curriculum professor quirrell: 1
to them like: 1
down his teacup: 1
faintly blue pattern: 1
finally made the: 1
spell which solves: 1
like an impostor: 1
the headmaster's style: 1
silent breeze professor: 1
but it was: 1
me a whole: 1
he didn't seem: 1
a triangle the: 1
on it the: 1
absently as he: 1
with a small: 1
to be becoming: 1
to notice that: 1
that the headmaster: 1
professor quirrell studied: 1
the headmaster had: 1
precisely said professor: 1
own tea again: 1
looked into the: 1
to draw back: 1
current curriculum professor: 1
to the wielder: 1
account harry had: 1
never mind let: 1
had them from: 1
off the coatrack: 1
out to discover: 1
malfoy was hurt: 1
doubt there is: 1
a voice like: 1
would i still: 1
across the table: 1
stared at it: 1
and before harry: 1
certainly becoming a: 1
icy voice i: 1
believed it himself: 1
the next great: 1
potter harry had: 1
stone is not: 1
been shocked out: 1
clear that professor: 1
to take vengeance: 1
table was in: 1
all the way: 1
of his cloak: 1
and a moment: 1
mr malfoy was: 1
artifact in the: 1
teacup with a: 1
not persuaded you: 1
have told the: 1
malfoy is albus: 1
notice that sort: 1
say no to: 1
for merlin or: 1
indeed a certain: 1
took a small: 1
his face was: 1
curtains were taking: 1
claim to have: 1
his seat at: 1
a line inside: 1
well tea there: 1
the table that: 1
still don't see: 1
still in that: 1
you that death: 1
harry's mind flashed: 1
longer trust my: 1
professor quirrell took: 1
was a dry: 1
and a dim: 1
harry say the: 1
the other end: 1
himself continuing forever: 1
any way to: 1
at least every: 1
the long wide: 1
a moment later: 1
he'd felt an: 1
went floating toward: 1
stand that there: 1
to his possibly-ultra-high-quality: 1
what was there: 1
fake gigantic price: 1
potter so you: 1
atlantis quite said: 1
not to do: 1
wasted a great: 1
quirrell's expression was: 1
so in your: 1
a glimpse at: 1
a faint tracery: 1
this present time: 1
on some fool: 1
which solves the: 1
i did it: 1
quirrell set down: 1
you happen to: 1
a fake gigantic: 1
changed their pattern: 1
tea cup in: 1
toward professor quirrell: 1
returned not that: 1
saucer noting absently: 1
mr potter so: 1
careful sip all: 1
an impostor pretending: 1
death which are: 1
tea itself was: 1
asked for it: 1
hurt in which: 1
in professor quirrell's: 1
i hope he: 1
alleged spirits tell: 1
was to be: 1
felt to you: 1
me that doesn't: 1
time mr potter: 1
from the beginning: 1
his teacup with: 1
to shimmer as: 1
from his own: 1
comed-tea first even: 1
last of what: 1
blue pattern and: 1
visible on the: 1
mere wizardry there: 1
professor quirrell was: 1
make the victim: 1
he has compromised: 1
headmaster about your: 1
of an afterlife: 1
and the only: 1
can recall professor: 1
an afterlife is: 1
himself might not: 1
malfoy please try: 1
you believe there's: 1
started to see: 1
back to a: 1
silent long enough: 1
a while a: 1
wasn't going to: 1
possibly-ultra-high-quality perhaps-ridiculously-expensive chinese: 1
questions for merlin: 1
he had seen: 1
the coatrack and: 1
was the defense: 1
the temperature of: 1
defense professor raised: 1
of effort in: 1
think fast enough: 1
guess and without: 1
tell no secrets: 1
had maneuvered himself: 1
immortal soul i: 1
seem to them: 1
with a line: 1
that the existence: 1
quirrell as he: 1
this professor quirrell: 1
to see any: 1
all wizards their: 1
i take it: 1
believe as he: 1
in life nor: 1
by the way: 1
diagon alley i: 1
would be expected: 1
fold into itself: 1
if you happen: 1
not do you: 1
matter myself there: 1
do this afternoon: 1
really just ordinary: 1
veracity is not: 1
to match and: 1
that sort of: 1
to get at: 1
only you asked: 1
still been shocked: 1
to get people: 1
to give any: 1
going on inside: 1
at it long: 1
smile on his: 1
symbol said harry: 1
principles it is: 1
i was hoping: 1
quirrell though i: 1
breeze professor quirrell: 1
you asked for: 1
point of it: 1
very persuasive mr: 1
at that and: 1
circle inside a: 1
idea about the: 1
the same thing: 1
as though to: 1
me for a: 1
a small high-pitched: 1
just to mess: 1
a similar warning: 1
to think faster: 1
way mr potter: 1
think faster next: 1
it is memory: 1
and make the: 1
of it was: 1
they put a: 1
some fool plot: 1
lifted itself off: 1
harry said to: 1
lucius sacrifices his: 1
just ordinary tea: 1
said harry didn't: 1
sky is blue': 1
did think fast: 1
have you ever: 1
continuing forever in: 1
nor could have: 1
trust my guesses: 1
it long enough: 1
persuasive mr potter: 1
tracery of elaborate: 1
them from the: 1
was there by: 1
guesses so much: 1
even taking that: 1
does not truly: 1
certain code and: 1
quirrell returned not: 1
some of those: 1
seem like the: 1
little harry said: 1
find it frustrating: 1
believed didn't seem: 1
those wizards were: 1
professor quirrell at: 1
drink a comed-tea: 1
professor quirrell as: 1
a chance to: 1
wizards were reasonably: 1
the world and: 1
defense professor's face: 1
because it is: 1
being boring and: 1
sort which hope: 1
wrong in people's: 1
made the connection: 1
same thing professor: 1
frowned dumbledore kills: 1
and seemed to: 1
didn't fool me: 1
he speaks it: 1
that death is: 1
to mess with: 1
that the symbol: 1
of dumbledore have: 1
were taking on: 1
let me know: 1
were times when: 1
hope he has: 1
quite a few: 1
not in doubt: 1
nodded the curtains: 1
mary's room professor: 1
once did so: 1
room professor quirrell: 1
drew on his: 1
that and saw: 1
no professor quirrell: 1
gave me a: 1
communicate with the: 1
like beliefs at: 1
now seemed to: 1
afterlife but simply: 1
his saucer the: 1
not to suggest: 1
whose veracity is: 1
without any wishful: 1
in atlantis quite: 1
pieces consider lord: 1
seem to see: 1
which is why: 1
all britain is: 1
want immortality before: 1
true inner map: 1
headmaster had convinced: 1
possibly do with: 1
that harry wanted: 1
among those reports: 1
end of the: 1
at least for: 1
headmaster can be: 1
hover charm the: 1
be dropping you: 1
adventure i don't: 1
alley i was: 1
pretending to be: 1
expected to produce: 1
not that harry: 1
himself actually harry: 1
fool me for: 1
the connection and: 1
to be ridiculously: 1
mood that saturday: 1
the tea itself: 1
be ridiculously expensive: 1
that wandless stuff: 1
by telling you: 1
felt very much: 1
the dead but: 1
quirrell professor quirrell: 1
afterlife is not: 1
mind let it: 1
the bill professor: 1
of that as: 1
all that much: 1
then harry got: 1
harry didn't anyway: 1
the deathly chill: 1
i could possibly: 1
going to give: 1
curtains of the: 1
makes it look: 1
harry to get: 1
in fact he: 1
is why the: 1
mary's room it: 1
calm the headmaster: 1
just said 'the: 1
corrected him until: 1
is mr potter: 1
i can recall: 1
in people's heads: 1
harry sipped his: 1
saucer some of: 1
be the result: 1
had changed their: 1
dead but these: 1
when talking to: 1
you if mr: 1
and elegant the: 1
me the usual: 1
rose from his: 1
and so was: 1
fast enough not: 1
harry really wanted: 1
if there is: 1
harry could take: 1
it look far: 1
itself was something: 1
me know i: 1
the afterlife do: 1
the symbol he: 1
perceive said a: 1
there were times: 1
certain devices said: 1
which case mr: 1
to learn that: 1
line inside a: 1
secrets they knew: 1
to harry harry: 1
tea then rose: 1
world and i: 1
actually an answer: 1
teacup again and: 1
heads yes said: 1
table toward professor: 1
to be cunning: 1
to finish the: 1
set aside his: 1
actually had a: 1
he actually had: 1
front of dumbledore: 1
to his lips: 1
harry couldn't appreciate: 1
the sky being: 1
valuable magical artifact: 1
who was around: 1
afterlife if i: 1
which could not: 1
be cunning in: 1
is indeed a: 1
something else i: 1
shrugged and sipped: 1
coatrack and went: 1
his head but: 1
quirrell then quite: 1
few questions for: 1
there by the: 1
way across the: 1
room seemed to: 1
that apparently was: 1
for a second: 1
professor quirrell's coat: 1
him professor quirrell: 1
afterlife harry had: 1
then drew on: 1
been going on: 1
frown on his: 1
price on the: 1
a little harry: 1
that symbol said: 1
immortality before he: 1
to cut short: 1
his own cup: 1
name harry couldn't: 1
other end of: 1
seemed to shimmer: 1
that harry couldn't: 1
centerpiece of mary's: 1
truly believe as: 1
glimpse at the: 1
perhaps-ridiculously-expensive chinese tea: 1
times took a: 1
strongly believe in: 1
of the table: 1
natural and elegant: 1
quirrell wasn't going: 1
he never had: 1
glimmering on it: 1
dumbledore does not: 1
draco makes it: 1
useful spell which: 1
nagging suspicion in: 1
a dry thin: 1
was drawn and: 1
yes said that: 1
coat lifted itself: 1
his saucer some: 1
harry's mind that: 1
your conversation with: 1
for it in: 1
quirrell shrugged and: 1
deal of effort: 1
head but i: 1
question harry said: 1
to repeat the: 1
took a sip: 1
seen on the: 1
afternoon harry nodded: 1
mental model of: 1
like it all: 1
with the dead: 1
given up harry: 1
persuaded you heck: 1
the way across: 1
actually liked this: 1
lifted up his: 1
fact he gave: 1
snowflakes now seemed: 1
usual line about: 1
sky being blue: 1
triangle the deathly: 1
moment then shook: 1
back on the: 1
besides avada kedavra: 1
extremely put out: 1
head and a: 1
there have been: 1
lecture about how: 1
did mr potter: 1
harry said he: 1
that and his: 1
that was the: 1
yet mr potter: 1
said harry precisely: 1
and his own: 1
hints not that: 1
professor quirrell himself: 1
a certain code: 1
the only point: 1
whose name harry: 1
he claimed to: 1
a thoughtful frown: 1
an impulse to: 1
and tipped it: 1
his lips again: 1
on the saucer: 1
soul in fact: 1
from the mind: 1
mean besides avada: 1
the chinese words: 1
going wrong in: 1
not that i: 1
professor quirrell shrugged: 1
tried to repeat: 1
elaborate snowflakes now: 1
compromised his principles: 1
not the most: 1
his head and: 1
the victim feel: 1
knew this and: 1
do that said: 1
dumbledore kills draco: 1
one last question: 1
believe there's an: 1
people's heads yes: 1
inside of his: 1
and professor quirrell: 1
from memory because: 1
impulse to drink: 1
there is mr: 1
to you like: 1
did so in: 1
kills draco makes: 1
skin and it: 1
not truly believe: 1
that doesn't seem: 1
becoming visible on: 1
headmaster believed it: 1
harry precisely said: 1
his cloak and: 1
albus dumbledore's opponent: 1
it that the: 1
correct way that: 1
life nor could: 1
resurrection stone is: 1
resurrection stone in: 1
mind the result: 1
floating toward the: 1
i once did: 1
threatened to throw: 1
to suggest the: 1
never had them: 1
model of himself: 1
quirrell knew this: 1
cast the hover: 1
cup to his: 1
pattern and a: 1
opponent said professor: 1
so was harry: 1
a few questions: 1
quite said professor: 1
into account harry: 1
cup in the: 1
their pattern to: 1
teacup there is: 1
quirrell had corrected: 1
had still been: 1
did it and: 1
code and they: 1
his skin and: 1
solves the problem: 1
believe in an: 1
the table toward: 1
to demonstrate three: 1
as though in: 1
mind flashed back: 1
but these i: 1
studied harry's tea-saucer: 1
i have looked: 1
and saw a: 1
or at least: 1
in which case: 1
long wide table: 1
and sat in: 1
on inside his: 1
telling you that: 1
professor quirrell set: 1
away everything abandon: 1
saw a cold: 1
at me that: 1
quirrell had needed: 1
tacking sound on: 1
don't think the: 1
eyes to his: 1
first even taking: 1
quirrell harry's mind: 1
to produce among: 1
have to cut: 1
i have a: 1
tea harry sipped: 1
way that professor: 1
dry thin smile: 1
myself there have: 1
next time mr: 1
until finally harry: 1
quirrell studied harry's: 1
or kept silent: 1
tablecloth professor quirrell's: 1
the result of: 1
least for this: 1
chinese tea i'm: 1
was harry and: 1
believe in the: 1
don't see it: 1
cold cold smile: 1
a circle inside: 1
do with eternity: 1
was clear that: 1
getting a glimpse: 1
harry set aside: 1
get at me: 1
a silent breeze: 1
very calm the: 1
hope not said: 1
chessboard all wizards: 1
see a stone: 1
it there was: 1
on his lips: 1
your true inner: 1
even pronounce or: 1
that he has: 1
if you stared: 1
doesn't seem like: 1
quirrell's voice sounded: 1
ever seen a: 1
thoughtful frown on: 1
becoming cynical yet: 1
be expected to: 1
pattern seeming at: 1
harry nodded and: 1
thing when talking: 1
neglected to notice: 1
harry holding the: 1
made harry say: 1
seems indistinguishable from: 1
his game against: 1
out of his: 1
shimmer as though: 1
he asked me: 1
the defense professor's: 1
but i don't: 1
wizards have wasted: 1
mind finally made: 1
over the table: 1
to discover that: 1
the tablecloth spread: 1
quirrell at least: 1
for this present: 1
potter it took: 1
image from the: 1
no secrets they: 1
his tea harry: 1
obvious i have: 1
you like the: 1
way to get: 1
answer harry observed: 1
same time as: 1
in your own: 1
and went floating: 1
expensive and make: 1
not neglected to: 1
which are not: 1
just felt to: 1
everything abandon his: 1
there is nothing: 1
for harry to: 1
finally harry had: 1
the world was: 1
went floating obligingly: 1
wielder - which: 1
seemed to draw: 1
that there is: 1
most valuable magical: 1
eternity gave me: 1
of thing when: 1
know i have: 1
as well is: 1
of those wizards: 1
chill seemed to: 1
afterlife the temperature: 1
lord malfoy is: 1
while a thoughtful: 1
the headmaster about: 1
room had changed: 1
the hover charm: 1
carefully not do: 1
is nothing which: 1
are you becoming: 1
why the resurrection: 1
anyone who was: 1
thoughtful if there: 1
style professor quirrell: 1
today's visit to: 1
be extremely put: 1
expensive tea that: 1
with it he'd: 1
wandless stuff but: 1
hastily i did: 1
had a mental: 1
a very peaceful: 1
blue ' they: 1
don't think he: 1
to notice this: 1
tasted to him: 1
and he frowned: 1
if i did: 1
there is something: 1
last question harry: 1
these i suspect: 1
wand to cast: 1
and without any: 1
ordinary tea only: 1
meekly i still: 1
it look like: 1
an afterlife if: 1
and mary's room: 1
hopefully at that: 1
flowers glimmering on: 1
people not to: 1
has not persuaded: 1
which hope and: 1
couldn't even pronounce: 1
talking to professor: 1
not said professor: 1
had not neglected: 1
was around in: 1
simply is there: 1
afterlife do let: 1
liked this tea: 1
been many claims: 1
reasonably intelligent mr: 1
the curtains of: 1
see it there: 1
his teacup again: 1
avada kedavra the: 1
his eyes to: 1
sound on his: 1
laughed harry didn't: 1
harry had dropped: 1
and it still: 1
on you if: 1
please try to: 1
any wishful thinking: 1
i fear we: 1
for immortality that's: 1
an afterlife what: 1
this tea and: 1
you becoming cynical: 1
quirrell's presence lord: 1
told the headmaster: 1
time as professor: 1
the way the: 1
way the world: 1
it being boring: 1
like the headmaster's: 1
that i can: 1
next great adventure: 1
faint tracery of: 1
chosen the question: 1
the symbol he'd: 1
think he actually: 1
thing professor quirrell: 1
enough or kept: 1
fear would be: 1
as he speaks: 1
times when harry: 1
think the headmaster: 1
a mental model: 1
though in a: 1
malfoy threatened to: 1
seeming at first: 1
again before answering: 1
so that the: 1
the centerpiece of: 1
harry said suddenly: 1
said after a: 1
put his teacup: 1
quirrell said after: 1
frustrated with whatever's: 1
only project an: 1
is there any: 1
sipped his tea: 1
it back as: 1
quirrell took a: 1
bit frustrated with: 1
professor quirrell knew: 1
them like beliefs: 1
take vengeance on: 1
learned by now: 1
had seen on: 1
conversation with lord: 1
every time harry: 1
quirrell then the: 1
quirrell harry really: 1
as professor quirrell: 1
harry and it: 1
finish the last: 1
professor quirrell harry's: 1
seemed had not: 1
about your conversation: 1
devices said to: 1
quirrell had let: 1
tea i'm certainly: 1
harry had maneuvered: 1
what people really: 1
vanished if you: 1
is loose in: 1
so you may: 1
quirrell said you: 1
to want immortality: 1
to a chance: 1
a dim tracery: 1
quirrell one last: 1
- which is: 1
is memory the: 1
apparently was far: 1
much as i: 1
distant in his: 1
the afterlife the: 1
take out his: 1
ice from the: 1
world was the: 1
a bit frustrated: 1
saturday and so: 1
colder more distant: 1
the result seems: 1
harry's mind finally: 1
this and was: 1
very peaceful pattern: 1
long seconds for: 1
it and lucius: 1
not that he: 1
harry said meekly: 1
in his eyes: 1
quirrell himself might: 1
three times took: 1
'i strongly believe: 1
asked me what: 1
like the way: 1
it was really: 1
was a quiet: 1
drawn had vanished: 1
claimed to have: 1
in the sky: 1
shall have to: 1
his possibly-ultra-high-quality perhaps-ridiculously-expensive: 1
or anyone who: 1
people really believed: 1
a whole long: 1
spread over the: 1
in the afterlife: 1
resurrection stone harry: 1
bill professor quirrell's: 1
of mary's room: 1
sat in silence: 1
for a moment: 1
shook his head: 1
to dumbledore of: 1
now to notice: 1
an answer harry: 1
must have been: 1
to drink a: 1
long lecture about: 1
table that dumbledore: 1
tablecloth spread over: 1
it does talk: 1
faster next time: 1
said harry and: 1
it took more: 1
to get it: 1
put out to: 1
professor magic is: 1
result of mere: 1
more distant in: 1
is their chessboard: 1
ridiculously expensive tea: 1
professor quirrell's voice: 1
not known to: 1
before he claimed: 1
seen a stone: 1
see a faint: 1
room it seemed: 1
professor quirrell one: 1
his lips and: 1
their pieces consider: 1
felt an impulse: 1
britain is their: 1
but simply is: 1
it still tasted: 1
far above his: 1
as professor quirrell's: 1
in a silent: 1
life on some: 1
his principles it: 1
conflict between that: 1
something whose name: 1
was something whose: 1
similar warning from: 1
maybe it was: 1
which had made: 1
cup making it: 1
harry to his: 1
his teacup there: 1
kept silent long: 1
line about it: 1
can't quite visualize: 1
we shall have: 1
they knew in: 1
case mr potter: 1
have a few: 1
said a voice: 1
teacup back on: 1
quite visualize what: 1
though i wouldn't: 1
more hints not: 1
then shook his: 1
a great deal: 1
with eternity gave: 1
he gave me: 1
short today's visit: 1
is not that: 1
there's an afterlife: 1
dropped his eyes: 1
the bill last: 1
quirrell was in: 1
eyes you spoke: 1
lips again before: 1
you should not: 1
look far more: 1
on the defense: 1
more long seconds: 1
up his teacup: 1
so much as: 1
own claim to: 1
suddenly is there: 1
actually harry said: 1
calm tone i: 1
then quite a: 1
spirits tell no: 1
but if you: 1
seconds for harry: 1
produce among those: 1
have looked into: 1
take it harry: 1
his eyes you: 1
time all britain: 1
magical artifact in: 1
your life on: 1
speaks it is: 1
was thoughtful if: 1
in doubt there: 1
very calm tone: 1
say the same: 1
magic is loose: 1
at first like: 1
them then harry's: 1
sip from his: 1
into the matter: 1
say 'i strongly: 1
as the ordinary: 1
and he didn't: 1
as he did: 1
teacup a little: 1
drawn and thoughtful: 1
i did think: 1
world said harry: 1
harry had still: 1
far more natural: 1
with whatever's going: 1
enough not to: 1
visualize what must: 1
and sipped his: 1
my guesses so: 1
silence the tablecloth: 1
into getting a: 1
potter i hope: 1
have learned after: 1
nobody actually liked: 1
learn that wandless: 1
you ever seen: 1
i must do: 1
harry felt very: 1
beliefs at all: 1
mr potter it: 1
much maybe nobody: 1
you believe in: 1
very much like: 1
looked up hopefully: 1
that he never: 1
into itself as: 1
what must have: 1
can be very: 1
throw away everything: 1
had let him: 1
his game to: 1
i no longer: 1
i wouldn't say: 1
harry said as: 1
get people not: 1
a small careful: 1
said 'the sky: 1
only point of: 1
is not in: 1
it i mean: 1
harry couldn't even: 1
up hopefully at: 1
an afterlife but: 1
it in a: 1
first like plain: 1
is that he: 1
the obvious idea: 1
the usual line: 1
a moment then: 1
inner map of: 1
knew in life: 1
symbol he had: 1
really wanted to: 1
he'd drawn had: 1
and fear would: 1
whatever's going wrong: 1
there any way: 1
then harry's mind: 1
of the sort: 1
to be dropping: 1
match and seemed: 1
set down his: 1
back fold into: 1
consider lord malfoy: 1
professor quirrell wasn't: 1
fact maybe it: 1
moment later the: 1
i find it: 1
had corrected him: 1
get away with: 1
has compromised his: 1
had needed to: 1
many claims of: 1
might not like: 1
harry got it: 1
then the defense: 1
immortal soul in: 1
the way mr: 1
like plain cloth: 1
himself into getting: 1
again and tipped: 1
merlin or anyone: 1
but never mind: 1
i'm certainly becoming: 1
warning from draco: 1
quirrell's coat lifted: 1
throw away your: 1
a contemplative mood: 1
on the tablecloth: 1
tone i would: 1
suggest the obvious: 1
that said harry: 1
about how awful: 1
victim feel unappreciative: 1
he has not: 1
that's not actually: 1
impostor pretending to: 1
in that very: 1
saucer the symbol: 1
aside his teacup: 1
boring and he: 1
sort of thing: 1
notice this professor: 1
do let me: 1
sip all the: 1
connection and he: 1
own wand to: 1
said to his: 1
wizardry there are: 1
me what i: 1
plain cloth but: 1
the world just: 1
was really just: 1
discover that the: 1
smile on the: 1
least every time: 1
harry looked up: 1
an afterlife harry: 1
loose in the: 1
that into account: 1
got it i: 1
the saucer noting: 1
cunning in professor: 1
needed to demonstrate: 1
with him professor: 1
seat at the: 1
is albus dumbledore's: 1
deliberately buying ridiculously: 1
gigantic price on: 1
have been many: 1
existence of an: 1
the headmaster can: 1
result seems indistinguishable: 1
though to finish: 1
of himself continuing: 1
would be extremely: 1
you may take: 1
i'm sorry professor: 1
not have told: 1
on his face: 1
sorry professor quirrell: 1
harry wanted them: 1
mind that professor: 1
it seemed had: 1
professor's face then: 1
like ice from: 1
and i no: 1
i can't quite: 1
what i could: 1
table that was: 1
not obvious i: 1
could possibly do: 1
hope and fear: 1
but that apparently: 1
voice sounded very: 1
the curtains were: 1
him get away: 1
from his seat: 1
time and professor: 1
wishful thinking do: 1
his teacup then: 1
tea that harry: 1
presence lord malfoy: 1
whole long lecture: 1
demonstrate three times: 1
small careful sip: 1
must do this: 1
to the afterlife: 1
is the next: 1
last time and: 1
that as well: 1
shrugged on his: 1
tea again he: 1
immortality that's not: 1
potter i fear: 1
him until finally: 1
you to throw: 1
map of the: 1
have been going: 1
claims of the: 1
raised his cup: 1
ridiculously expensive and: 1
floating obligingly across: 1
suspicion in harry's: 1
people didn't say: 1
elegant the tea: 1
there is indeed: 1
i suspect only: 1
said you should: 1
professor raised his: 1
the question carefully: 1
and finished his: 1
are not known: 1
headmaster's style professor: 1
own tea then: 1
being blue ': 1
great deal of: 1
look like i: 1
all people didn't: 1
said to communicate: 1
spoke to dumbledore: 1
it but it: 1
it all that: 1
at the bill: 1
high-pitched tacking sound: 1
tipped it back: 1
it frustrating as: 1
from the other: 1
give any more: 1
was the centerpiece: 1
wizards their pieces: 1
was to want: 1
any conflict between: 1
is the resurrection: 1
in a contemplative: 1
forever in the: 1
harry had tried: 1
was deliberately buying: 1
to try it: 1
of mere wizardry: 1
vengeance on you: 1
wanted to learn: 1
harry harry put: 1
that much maybe: 1
had chosen the: 1
by now to: 1
not actually an: 1
holding the tea: 1
with lord malfoy: 1
harry observed he'd: 1
stone in front: 1
cloth but if: 1
again he asked: 1
plot by telling: 1
memory the alleged: 1
not like it: 1
the most valuable: 1
in silence the: 1
to diagon alley: 1
i should hope: 1
i would be: 1
harry and mary's: 1
soul i can't: 1
an image from: 1
dropping you perceive: 1
observed he'd learned: 1
as i once: 1
i did mr: 1
well is there: 1
back as though: 1
own cup making: 1
said meekly i: 1
it would -: 1
the beginning are: 1
be very persuasive: 1
the last of: 1
could have learned: 1
his teacup back: 1
sacrifices his game: 1
becoming a bit: 1
teacup then drew: 1
it harry nodded: 1
itself as the: 1
defense professor magic: 1
floating back to: 1
their searches for: 1
the inside of: 1
charm the saucer: 1
on the inside: 1
said hastily i: 1
stone with that: 1
i still don't: 1
world just felt: 1
before answering his: 1
in harry's mind: 1
tea there was: 1
his own wand: 1
on a faintly: 1
then rose from: 1
above his current: 1
out his own: 1
inside a triangle: 1
from draco which: 1
anyway harry said: 1
own tea and: 1
at the same: 1
may take it: 1
did so that: 1
recall professor quirrell: 1
flashed back to: 1
fool plot by: 1
his coat would: 1
' they just: 1
between that and: 1
try to think: 1
professor quirrell professor: 1

to look at: 2
one of my: 2
there was the: 2

there was something: 2
proper magical school: 2

as if harry: 2
looking a little: 2
he was angry: 2
the younger students: 2
their fifth year: 2
his voice now: 2
would do doesn't: 2
thing to do: 2
you allowed this: 2
a glimpse of: 2
for a few: 2
sound like the: 2
end up using: 2
but in the: 2
to see if: 2
it is a: 2
will be more: 2
no point in: 2
in the classroom: 2
not the only: 2
entrusted with time-turners: 2
what i did: 2
mr potter the: 2
able to sleep: 2

a proper magical: 2
not to smile: 2
severus you are: 2
across the room: 2

if harry had: 2

a lot of: 2
for the first: 2
raised his hand: 2
and that is: 2
he certainly did: 2
the headmaster's office: 2

his pouch and: 2
this is your: 2
mr potter if: 2
to say she: 2
a quiet voice: 2
fifth year and: 2
sort of thing: 2
drained away and: 2
when it became: 2
seemed to be: 2
he had a: 2
to get out: 2
what he'd just: 2
tried to tell: 2
turned his face: 2
an evil potions: 2
he doesn't like: 2
aside from that: 2
a few moments: 2
turned back to: 2
he just couldn't: 2

to protect himself: 2
students who cannot: 2
it seemed that: 2
his eyes were: 2
harry glanced briefly: 2
dangerous place and: 2
looked at her: 2
their fourth year: 2
does sound like: 2
as you would: 2
he'd just done: 2
if you had: 2
this is a: 2
shot her a: 2
kept his face: 2
i told you: 2
beginning to doubt: 2
be entrusted with: 2
that does sound: 2
it was the: 2
very long time: 2
now he was: 2
would there be: 2

most vulnerable victims: 2

harry's face twisted: 2
the importance of: 2
back to the: 2
this is not: 2

the look on: 2
of students in: 2
that it was: 2
saying it because: 2
ravenclaw for backchat: 2
in professor snape's: 2
not raise it: 2
back to dumbledore: 2
in a fashion: 2
it is not: 2

a very long: 2
harry kept his: 2

a hogwarts professor: 2
since the day: 2
away it was: 2
i am beginning: 2

his padded throne: 2
potter the headmaster: 2

the impression that: 2
it was only: 2

his face expressionless: 2
what she was: 2
now that he: 2
it will be: 2

potions master or: 2
in this castle: 2
the only one: 2
that might have: 2
to share with: 2
harry said but: 2
at the gryffindor: 2

compromise severus will: 1
powdered root of: 1
creatures like the: 1
boy you utter: 1
hope that not: 1
you are making: 1
harry had given: 1
threaten to abandon: 1

there and then: 1
younger parts of: 1
tried to remind: 1

ensnaring the senses: 1
i on the: 1
actual potions classroom: 1
go on for: 1
lax discipline on: 1
speak to dumbledore: 1
face was frozen: 1
coldly superior sneers: 1

carbon atom severus's: 1
needed to use: 1
mcgonagall harry minerva: 1
hand he did: 1
hall and then: 1
to say harry: 1
here severus said: 1

dumbledore boromir was: 1
so you used: 1
gaze was now: 1
he would like: 1

a mass of: 1
a little lower: 1
live with that: 1
candles fred whispered: 1
the youngest students: 1
of her and: 1
the points he: 1
potions master and: 1

an anticipatory sort: 1
strange flickered in: 1

strategy for destroying: 1
to destroy this: 1
to open only: 1
into the room: 1
hand was now: 1
of a fire: 1
wonder if i: 1
his robes were: 1
- oh that's: 1
completely neutral as: 1
knock at the: 1
some carefully measured: 1
sent to hogwarts: 1
quiet voice from: 1

binns i really: 1
head harry did: 1
quite pleased with: 1
right now there: 1
are slytherins threatening: 1
he now seemed: 1
cheered up considerably: 1
as harry processed: 1
silence finally dumbledore: 1
hermione frantically shook: 1
chosen side the: 1
down and don't: 1
you think he's: 1
please i don't: 1
harry's at all: 1

of it yourself: 1
what are you: 1
right now but: 1
i don't expect: 1
his abortive forays: 1

and the answerers: 1
by the necessary: 1
campaign with you: 1
with us harry: 1
tried asking hermione: 1
grows private harry: 1
best magical school: 1

full-throated warm humorous: 1
guess but a: 1
seemed a little: 1
severus snape was: 1
of calories as: 1
for collapsing like: 1
beginning the first: 1
them that he: 1
have gotten angry: 1
if so i'm: 1
is necessary -: 1
padded throne his: 1
expect to be: 1
at dumbledore then: 1
he was following: 1
can't say anything: 1
this morning might: 1
people who aren't: 1
while the classroom: 1
mr potter must: 1
her mind common: 1
points to slytherin: 1
interested in looking: 1
not sufficient then: 1
sound like harry's: 1
desk not the: 1
phoenix soared across: 1
if it's the: 1
contempt aside from: 1

discipline or are: 1
voice now a: 1
them we give: 1

and scrawled a: 1
wings like the: 1
me in the: 1
a cake waited: 1
uncertainty crossed harry's: 1
his face in: 1
at once dungeons: 1
pleased with himself: 1
to remind his: 1
to build his: 1
to come and: 1
a floo call: 1
master to be: 1
harry said the: 1
the door shut: 1
is sacred harry: 1
should bother writing: 1
with eyes and: 1
that and more: 1
rather caressing gloating: 1
widened four he: 1
them personally and: 1

year and under: 1
that the sorting: 1
student of hogwarts: 1
absolutely anything happen: 1

outraged response i: 1
stamped down the: 1
place around the: 1

was like a: 1
that it wanted: 1
someone hypnotized by: 1
only they knew: 1

to say what: 1
class his eyes: 1
great a pack: 1
a formal complaint: 1
to sleep at: 1

to him even: 1
finger motions which: 1
be followed harry's: 1
to terminate his: 1
the sound of: 1
with one smooth: 1
it it was: 1
forced to say: 1
had also reached: 1
feeling a bit: 1
a crazy headmaster: 1
to my attention: 1

dismissively to severus: 1

dumbledore smiling unacceptable: 1
my fellow students: 1

severus seated himself: 1
so we are: 1
chicken excuse me: 1
worried - some: 1
care and if: 1
filled up with: 1

felt a rush: 1
claimed it was: 1
dungeons any faster: 1

one of course: 1
heavily at breakfast: 1
whim of a: 1
frown if you: 1
tonelessly one of: 1

like someone hypnotized: 1
been waiting his: 1
to notice the: 1
voice now choked: 1
that wasn't an: 1
was speaking to: 1
warned me said: 1
it occurred to: 1
minerva thought despairingly: 1
of paper harry: 1
and then she: 1
pouch and gotten: 1
i said i: 1
see at a: 1
behind him saying: 1
been able to: 1
hogwarts from professor: 1

aware of the: 1
the great hall: 1
flash like a: 1
the song of: 1
an older ravenclaw: 1
magical school now: 1
if she didn't: 1
anyway they had: 1
risks either c-l-o-a-k: 1
of harry harry: 1
more wise and: 1
thought otherwise dumbledore: 1
which you are: 1

and have a: 1
dumbledore his face: 1

george harry swallowed: 1
either c-l-o-a-k his: 1
you a cake: 1

not every child: 1
one terrible motion: 1
her office sobbing: 1
are a slytherin: 1
the threat or: 1
narrow bridges torchlit: 1
take my leave: 1
and remembered that: 1

nodded slowly and: 1
won't count it: 1
infuriated all at: 1
while thinking about: 1
binns was a: 1
his veins like: 1
that sometimes but: 1
moments when the: 1
blow up the: 1
face had been: 1
of perfection and: 1
believe he desires: 1

ernie macmillan smartly: 1
his message not: 1

equally icy i: 1
you are the: 1

and fled from: 1
what just happened: 1
to a chicken: 1
course no words: 1
a flame and: 1
others who are: 1
to blow up: 1
in one terrible: 1
long moment this: 1
holding harry's hand: 1
is indistinguishable from: 1
tapped her wand: 1
supposed to transfigure: 1
but right now: 1

i set a: 1
harry going to: 1
vision and was: 1
to five hours: 1
and wolfsbane that: 1
expressionless began to: 1
down harry potter's: 1
agony but he: 1
retain the time-turner: 1
would be enough: 1
the headmaster you: 1
why now the: 1
she would have: 1
certainly not the: 1
the consequences if: 1
me add it: 1
it wanted harry: 1
harry had also: 1
find severus said: 1
and potions he: 1
of rashers he'd: 1

frankly in front: 1
as expressionless as: 1
cupcake his stomach: 1
told me everything: 1

better teacher instead: 1
told you i: 1

phoenix vanished from: 1
too not just: 1
had the house: 1
explain how it: 1
things seemed clearer: 1
or it just: 1
understanding - so: 1
a single one: 1
room and grasped: 1
outside and no: 1
through the great: 1
play by my: 1
one else was: 1
vanished from his: 1
about with the: 1
that me neither: 1
sudden uncertainty crossed: 1
every member of: 1
abortive forays into: 1
from a dream: 1
like him for: 1
a reasonable question: 1
was doing minerva: 1
right said harry: 1
a guess but: 1
were allowed to: 1
came to selecting: 1
any right to: 1
down said dumbledore: 1
pick it up: 1
would have been: 1
long time or: 1
reflected and returning: 1
well that wasn't: 1
laughing full-throated warm: 1
if anyone asks: 1
heart was pounding: 1
of a prejudiced: 1
it is known: 1
his face i: 1
she caught a: 1
figured it out: 1
not possessed a: 1
what do you: 1
for more than: 1
and getting me: 1
down to the: 1
said she didn't: 1
she finished and: 1
that in magical: 1
basement a basement: 1
crossed his mind: 1
far enough along: 1
so said a: 1
antagonized a teacher: 1
rejoinder that had: 1
cheer you up: 1
very much in: 1
part in provoking: 1
he'd already given: 1
doesn't like and: 1
learning speed i: 1
and harry well: 1
enmity if there: 1
fawkes left her: 1
the deputy headmistress: 1
two per day: 1
and then tried: 1
a little that: 1
gaze was also: 1
important when you: 1
extremely grateful you: 1
said cheerfully carry: 1
severus will not: 1
i'm sorry mr: 1
could see very: 1
been trying to: 1
said fred after: 1
said fred completely: 1
fawkes to sing: 1
two of them: 1
food and spit-out: 1
giving her a: 1
continue to be: 1
tears that had: 1
i get that: 1
was empty one: 1
his hair spotted: 1
severus said in: 1
behind her desk: 1
necessary - there: 1
i do expect: 1
treat you with: 1
they survive no: 1
of the headmaster: 1
of severus's and: 1
if there is: 1
a little unsteady: 1
up potter ten: 1
on severus you: 1
and bore it: 1
random facts that: 1
soared across the: 1
as the hero: 1
you didn't need: 1
that you and: 1
with the force: 1
for monkshood and: 1
ravenclaw had and: 1
from that no: 1
that he'd been: 1
sound of many: 1
didn't let himself: 1
face was still: 1
to transfigure some: 1
the phoenix soared: 1
discipline from which: 1
seemed to notice: 1
been worth a: 1
work no matter: 1
let us make: 1
one brief moment: 1
remembered that the: 1
harry's eyes filled: 1
she found it: 1
lowered his hand: 1
empty wooden stool: 1
awful to non-slytherin: 1
punishme- you will: 1
burned which meant: 1
you vanished from: 1
anyone who trifles: 1
been angry the: 1
up to five: 1
seems impolite to: 1
done what he'd: 1
an instant and: 1
chatting about with: 1
the children placed: 1
intention of letting: 1
motions which worked: 1
hard it seemed: 1
wall and with: 1
- so said: 1
i saw the: 1
to say a: 1
professor then there: 1
know the answers: 1
look at his: 1
celebrity is present: 1
quashed i will: 1
the sheer raw: 1
of trouble professor: 1
severus paused looking: 1
history professor binns: 1
into a twisted: 1
do about it: 1
naturally the office: 1
to the headmaster's: 1
you open your: 1
is that i: 1
victim and certainly: 1
along without you: 1
temper the first: 1
under his desk: 1
inexcusable violation of: 1
students not to: 1
not genuine and: 1
only between the: 1
to be the: 1
is thinking that: 1
many electrons are: 1
fifteen minutes into: 1
might see at: 1
safely invisible that: 1
you call school: 1
there must be: 1
a doubles session: 1
safe minerva mcgonagall: 1
sudden horror dawned: 1
in an instant: 1
if i find: 1
it was joking: 1
could both get: 1
are how much: 1
words harry's gaze: 1
any reason to: 1
that'll cheer you: 1
while i'm here: 1
harry said i: 1
on the table: 1
truth is that: 1
to get back: 1
recall how many: 1
eyes and feet: 1
seated himself behind: 1
empty as a: 1
openly so was: 1
even occurred to: 1
'abracadabra' let's try: 1
and panicky and: 1
night sky without: 1
didn't end up: 1
textbook either harry: 1
so it went: 1
into severus's cold: 1
potter said a: 1
had forgotten how: 1
table harry resumed: 1
of discipline because: 1
one minerva leaned: 1
and he certainly: 1
in him and: 1
percent as bad: 1
is a joke: 1
and more importantly: 1
his mind was: 1
their faces such: 1
my deduction of: 1
of utter contempt: 1
zero kelvin how: 1
one month potter: 1
just as it: 1
now you have: 1
back mr potter: 1
sorry he whispered: 1
warned him not: 1
and they walked: 1
words came out: 1
knew which she: 1
they end up: 1
voice laughed what: 1
more importantly she: 1
planned on ending: 1
shoulder and swooped: 1
potter harry minerva: 1
regular hogwarts student: 1
once he was: 1
thinly sudden horror: 1
was the muffled: 1
rats would there: 1
room that was: 1
of psychic energy: 1
by the ever-changing: 1
and harry sat: 1
spit-out drinks from: 1
time-turner to go: 1
you the sorting: 1
this man to: 1
so we must: 1
not the one: 1
the protective shell: 1
been taken severus: 1
side had done: 1
slowly harry lowered: 1
he would come: 1
his face away: 1
was still there: 1
about whom you're: 1
all others harry: 1
stone corridors looking: 1
brief and memorized: 1
is the other: 1
detention thank you: 1
and harry still: 1
of the pattern: 1
showed in his: 1
universe was broken: 1
now a little: 1
appropriate - declined: 1
he needed fawkes: 1
had been taken: 1
he crossed the: 1
them if i: 1
he could always: 1
shut behind him: 1
who i rather: 1
and a half: 1
headmaster said the: 1
didn't speak for: 1
the moment when: 1
less abusive professors: 1
as tutors of: 1
of a subordinate: 1
chokes at the: 1
will really understand: 1
one he'd tried: 1
headmaster said one: 1
up earlier and: 1
what could we: 1
looking at a: 1
going to object: 1
office sobbing she: 1
makes you vulnerable: 1
the absence of: 1

potter you have: 1
and caught a: 1
it harry blurted: 1
the right thing: 1
single clap from: 1

going about being: 1
to the teacher's: 1
spoken like a: 1
something sudden uncertainty: 1
professor snape it: 1
or abuse i: 1
force of that: 1
just too painful: 1
a quiet hour: 1
headmaster's office dumbledore: 1
his blood seemed: 1
and for your: 1
the house elves: 1
meaning which no: 1

and then dumbledore: 1
my vault something: 1
the nice people: 1
his medication or: 1
for your misbehavior: 1
uncertainly at severus: 1
harry tried to: 1
alone harry's voice: 1
a bezoar is: 1
behest not lucius: 1
and quietus silenced: 1
majeste even severus: 1
in our session: 1
she simply couldn't: 1
child and i: 1
the wrong thing: 1
thought of the: 1
tell me said: 1

gaze grew uncertain: 1
hours more if: 1

out yet she: 1
also to stop: 1
in taking risks: 1
possible that most: 1
brief moment that: 1
headmaster his voice: 1

the stone corridors: 1
a basement a: 1
the actual potions: 1
open to you: 1
yourself in enough: 1
and creepier i: 1

teacher three orders: 1

severus said softly: 1
it became apparent: 1
me a bezoar: 1
hover in front: 1
bit skeptical the: 1
also reached into: 1
wished to speak: 1
and got up: 1
sleep at a: 1
he'd antagonized a: 1
even harry were: 1
harry didn't let: 1

from which you: 1

they walked the: 1
severus's direction send: 1
the boy-who-lived even: 1
henceforth i will: 1

with this problem: 1
that had crossed: 1
showed too harry: 1
me i'm sorry: 1
to walk back: 1
the tablecloth and: 1
the current century: 1

dropping slowly back: 1
each other in: 1
faces such as: 1
like harry's at: 1

harry cheered up: 1
probably thought he: 1
no sound was: 1

bottomless abyss a: 1
in a human: 1
hopeless said fred: 1
raised her chin: 1
one smooth motion: 1
be enough for: 1

for a way: 1
in one of: 1
up after five: 1
i almost cried: 1
table and grabbed: 1
if he smiled: 1
they wanted to: 1
more mindful of: 1
a worried voice: 1
more aware of: 1
slowly back down: 1
conceit how do: 1
it again he: 1
what sort of: 1
from your perspective: 1
a better class: 1
it to be: 1

at each other: 1
hand over your: 1
not to meet: 1
scarfing his breakfast: 1
time all because: 1

wavering does he: 1
found it hard: 1
under his robes: 1
to where harry: 1
paused looking quite: 1
try never to: 1
importance of what: 1
and then it: 1
her shoulder and: 1
secret of severus's: 1
you that you: 1
harry's lips curved: 1
grew hard and: 1
her blood her: 1

like a smooth: 1
greatly and i: 1
jaw dropped minerva: 1
reading it and: 1
time minerva couldn't: 1
first thought that: 1

indistinguishable from magic: 1
severus again and: 1

this castle runs: 1

about i suggest: 1
of admiration but: 1
what in merlin's: 1
after all he: 1
students even had: 1
and no point: 1
from slytherin and: 1

on my part: 1

somewhat trembling voice: 1
binns of history: 1
away from dumbledore: 1
two desks over: 1

spock but he'd: 1
foolishly so you: 1

sheer astonishment and: 1
harry processed this: 1
if there was: 1

psychic energy accompanying: 1
crossed harry's face: 1
voice which the: 1
idea silencio said: 1
open and harry: 1
know said fred: 1
was giving her: 1
quiet and deadly: 1
slowly and the: 1
severus smoothly stood: 1
that the music: 1
was a lot: 1
him smiling grimly: 1
clearly identifiable in: 1
need an evil: 1
happily but hogwarts: 1
we won't count: 1
harry turned back: 1
i suspect that: 1

in four layers: 1

from two desks: 1
that three full: 1
not sorted into: 1

like spock but: 1
time and when: 1
it was all: 1
mr potter harry's: 1

in the back: 1
the deputy was: 1

angry had gotten: 1
ever-changing light of: 1
a hand at: 1
hurt him hermione: 1
potter asphodel and: 1
then stopped in: 1
made by ghosts: 1
severus's cold gaze: 1
actually identify some: 1
are students who: 1
to dumbledore again: 1
breath and got: 1
originally sat down: 1
a dangerous place: 1
or instinctively raised: 1
wanted to see: 1
he realized what: 1
prejudiced term that: 1
dungeons in hogwarts: 1
said flatly but: 1
harry thought about: 1
public use of: 1
a long moment: 1
professor can hardly: 1
now but i'm: 1
to draw professor: 1
you are here: 1
in much the: 1
of the underlying: 1
shut up potter: 1
it didn't turn: 1
more he needed: 1

i don't remember: 1
that was your: 1

gaped at her: 1
she could possibly: 1
controlled her reaction: 1
dumbledore's gaze was: 1
looked at each: 1
the wall and: 1
his gaze over: 1
maybe when he: 1
the time-turner and: 1
harry took six: 1
because they become: 1
was too small: 1
even if they: 1
no apology will: 1
dumbledore sat in: 1
non-slytherin in the: 1
said george yeah: 1
vulnerable i am: 1
desk three times: 1

apparent that no: 1
it was breakfast: 1
of a hogwarts: 1
severus was being: 1
send him away: 1
the room and: 1
true there's an: 1
lunch had arrived: 1

door though now: 1
something that it: 1
will not strike: 1
discipline on his: 1
grew uncertain his: 1
the board is: 1
touched what is: 1
forward away from: 1
snap neville screamed: 1
i would have: 1
so i think: 1
harry's voice swiftly: 1
as the door: 1
briefed fully at: 1
of course you're: 1
between the hours: 1
teacher he'd met: 1

wobbling changing pitch: 1
minerva didn't speak: 1
could make absolutely: 1
potter said an: 1
and certainly not: 1
the system why: 1
fireplace would sound: 1
compared to having: 1
come over fred: 1
robes and looking: 1
open the book: 1
professional courtesy or: 1
possessed a time-turner: 1

of liquids that: 1
to wonder and: 1
alone and i'll: 1
classes severus said: 1
covered every centimeter: 1
and looking a: 1
smiling thinly he: 1
and so it: 1
not to be: 1
up and harry: 1
or was it: 1

truth the truth: 1
minerva almost gasped: 1

in his hand: 1
and greasy there: 1
a party for: 1

hair found in: 1
fired fired said: 1
the compromise that: 1
didn't mean the: 1
harry opened his: 1
sorry too mr: 1
what hermione tried: 1
fair mr potter: 1
harder he pounded: 1
i hope that: 1

there severus smiled: 1
third plate of: 1
unfairness of the: 1

burning humiliation -: 1
irreplaceable learning time: 1

glory even stopper: 1
above the law: 1
potter could make: 1
admiration but no: 1
hat was warning: 1

appeared preemptory he: 1
a look and: 1
and unruly student: 1
it simple either: 1
decent dungeons it: 1
lot pickier when: 1
that the level: 1
i read that: 1

his voice deadly: 1
i threatened to: 1
time-turner even in: 1
do such a: 1
lese majeste even: 1
you about an: 1
stabbed him no: 1
came a worried: 1
all now you: 1
sounding genuinely surprised: 1
minerva raised her: 1
from her office: 1
- he glanced: 1
feel that strict: 1
feeling this morning: 1
hat potter did: 1
to carry out: 1
humiliation - tut: 1
said smiling even: 1
initial what -: 1
today is it: 1
not comply with: 1
read one thousand: 1
and mid-gesture minerva: 1
coolness wavered fear: 1
possibly tell the: 1
to everyone who: 1
need to take: 1
boromir was at: 1
a button which: 1
all the students: 1
and with one: 1
desks then harry: 1
his brief and: 1
why you allowed: 1
said dumbledore i've: 1
why the positive: 1
of detention will: 1
for everyone for: 1
have with me: 1
to lock it: 1
history that does: 1
was harry looked: 1
it and he: 1
open the door: 1
magic gives their: 1
beating too fast: 1
an empty wooden: 1
a goat it: 1
there were no: 1
think i'll take: 1
believe this is: 1
everything really harry: 1
a bit disappointed: 1
that was doing: 1
snape is to: 1
power of liquids: 1
such as what: 1
severus to see: 1
collected and utterly: 1
class flinched hermione's: 1
but history class: 1
thought that crossed: 1
harry got up: 1
peace of the: 1
memorized speech the: 1
closed it again: 1
strapped to afford: 1
no intention of: 1
occurred to anyone: 1
but then you: 1
quest and if: 1
the descent seemed: 1
top and doing: 1
until he was: 1
of sudden understanding: 1
out and landed: 1
turned toward her: 1
the phoenix vanished: 1
the discipline of: 1
place is almost: 1
was not right: 1
and do so: 1
the best magical: 1
is insanity exploded: 1
bezoar that's not: 1
was now completely: 1
was outside the: 1
cold expulsion mr: 1
do minerva gasped: 1
wasn't exactly my: 1
to an infusion: 1
to raise her: 1
formal complaint against: 1
master and the: 1
occurred to harry: 1
crazy headmaster his: 1
and from that: 1
him not to: 1
boy chuckled briefly: 1
i am saying: 1
sorting hat potter: 1
either aside from: 1
minerva shook her: 1
that not a: 1
all he discovered: 1
can i get: 1
the potions professor: 1
protect himself the: 1
fred you mean: 1
through the gap: 1
his voice sounded: 1
i have done: 1
bottom and i: 1
you he said: 1
hero wins of: 1
understand to start: 1
the truth i: 1
to haul him: 1
of vision and: 1
side is it: 1
before he'd threatened: 1
short trip since: 1
am being forced: 1
deadly calm i: 1
so harry said: 1
master's face was: 1
to it you'll: 1
remind his brain: 1
more broadly i: 1
would cure any: 1
disappointed in him: 1
trying to keep: 1
disappointed in his: 1
the underlying game: 1
trouble remembering the: 1
with cold contempt: 1
so let's compromise: 1
and important when: 1
this matter concluded: 1
potion which lengthens: 1
will play by: 1
wormwood harry blinked: 1
smiling i suppose: 1
dumbledore said cheerfully: 1
over the summer: 1
money in my: 1
from ravenclaw now: 1
potions professor should: 1
her and continued: 1
very carefully and: 1
from simply going: 1
his hand he: 1
as she'd ever: 1
the askers knew: 1
you mr potter: 1
right fred and: 1
the professor was: 1
not complicated said: 1
you had read: 1
him that seemed: 1
severus and dumbledore: 1
doing in my: 1
attend hogwarts i: 1
clearly the reply: 1
a bezoar that's: 1
for everyone the: 1
about an additional: 1
could possibly say: 1
he didn't know: 1
wings continued flapping: 1
as a teacher: 1
to abandon us: 1
lot of calories: 1
which no simple: 1
suppose dumbledore said: 1
his jaw dropped: 1
tended to have: 1
find that you: 1
superior sneers from: 1
of the system: 1
careful of the: 1
severus's smile vanished: 1
otherwise dumbledore was: 1
just told us: 1
hogwarts i disrupted: 1
will be appropriate: 1
does need an: 1
said with cold: 1
eyes if crying: 1
out of our: 1
she started to: 1
harry's return gaze: 1
i was just: 1
if they offered: 1
different sentences such: 1
start a newspaper: 1
a teacher who: 1
what said severus: 1
him and headed: 1
office harry was: 1
it didn't seem: 1
harry had almost: 1
moss would there: 1
sternly and handed: 1
classes and so: 1
the room like: 1
keep your head: 1
we give them: 1
were clearly identifiable: 1
said slowly she: 1
never to follow: 1
the points ravenclaw: 1
of potionmaking as: 1
front of him: 1
will make it: 1
snape behaved in: 1
said minerva her: 1
shafted i wouldn't: 1
bad example for: 1
again it is: 1
you as for: 1
in his reading: 1
have disappointed you: 1
is interested in: 1
classroom and deprived: 1
severus was reading: 1
down so that: 1
just one eyebrow: 1
called the dungeons: 1
put it will: 1
that and wanting: 1
the truth even: 1
the newly restricted: 1
quite a number: 1
looks upon their: 1
through human veins: 1
she glanced uncertainly: 1
has become ridiculous: 1
is your punishment: 1
this to your: 1
expressionless look on: 1
be punished for: 1
harry potter our: 1
robes minerva sat: 1
near the back: 1
do if she: 1
abyss a short: 1
somewhere he wasn't: 1
his gaze briefly: 1
on for several: 1
does that work: 1
that was seen: 1
face said everything: 1
him harry looked: 1
who can see: 1
that you managed: 1
to hover in: 1
tears i'm sorry: 1
couldn't let that: 1
an effective strategy: 1
dumbledore leave minerva: 1
all the points: 1
have nothing that: 1
real and might: 1
none had departed: 1
his voice as: 1
way the man: 1
to discipline you: 1
swung closed i'm: 1
he tore off: 1
a voice colder: 1
find me a: 1
girls gave him: 1
i should warn: 1

normal-harry had forgotten: 1
for it i: 1
swept into the: 1
and younger my: 1
it wasn't just: 1
gargoyle stepped back: 1
- hermione's hand: 1
the students gazing: 1

away and he: 1
of history professor: 1

this and then: 1
about it for: 1
very foolishly so: 1
since monday how: 1
voice swiftly and: 1
face his coolness: 1
speak but she: 1
that stopped him: 1
will have its: 1
reading a textbook: 1
slight only a: 1
her she knew: 1
ministry on public: 1
and soft like: 1
there aren't any: 1
legend of hogwarts: 1
allowed to get: 1
let anything slip: 1
red-golden wings like: 1
ghost to teach: 1
can manage to: 1
target minerva's body: 1
nazgul doing in: 1
her another look: 1
your students maintaining: 1
the way in: 1

any teachers and: 1
music seemed to: 1
rotating stairs descending: 1

her reaction just: 1
you will really: 1
silencio said severus's: 1

on shelves that: 1
anyone in hogwarts: 1
recorded history what: 1

and patches of: 1
only the question: 1
anything about it: 1
his voice grew: 1

now laughing even: 1
at my full: 1
and his outraged: 1
her shoulder she: 1
rival but she: 1

himself to think: 1
protected them if: 1
of that and: 1
or i do: 1
of school discipline: 1
suppose that is: 1
not tolerate bullying: 1

my accustomed practice: 1
me will regret: 1

of this meeting: 1
no sound from: 1
to justin finch-fletchley: 1

slowly i am: 1

standing near the: 1

mr potter -: 1

each other scrambled: 1
that hogwarts cannot: 1
of what you: 1
down well that: 1
dumbledore turned to: 1
flinched hermione's hand: 1
a time-turner in: 1
across the classroom: 1
him minerva felt: 1
and the most: 1
to plead with: 1
threat or fear: 1
severus it's not: 1
a reasonable time: 1
until ah yes: 1
said slowly that: 1
harry said flatly: 1
good mor- harry's: 1
in all my: 1
solidified hair found: 1
leave of this: 1
about being absolutely: 1

and landed on: 1
i would find: 1
hufflepuff table harry: 1
in her throat: 1

wand-waving here many: 1
you've been allowed: 1

sacred harry said: 1
and worried looks: 1
headmaster's office harry: 1

suspect that if: 1
disappointed you i'm: 1
last bite of: 1
vault something about: 1
sprout at the: 1
about ghosts it: 1
matter by a: 1
didn't say it: 1
mcgonagall disappointed in: 1
has something he: 1
your time-turner please: 1
out ten points: 1
off on you: 1
agonized the descent: 1
touched his gaze: 1
table where a: 1
i disrupted the: 1
hair and it: 1
headmaster this is: 1
freezing winter across: 1
this class and: 1
time later they: 1
were fully self-aware: 1
i have to: 1
it he'd lost: 1
was speechless this: 1
leave minerva alone: 1
and serves hogwarts: 1
us you'd teach: 1
able to attend: 1
i still feel: 1
anyone else need: 1
sleeping potion so: 1
something agonized the: 1
him off on: 1
want in you: 1
now dumbledore's gaze: 1
fred completely hopeless: 1
the school has: 1
of going back: 1
newspaper campaign with: 1

again something strange: 1
now seemed a: 1
ministry has delivered: 1
detentions should he: 1
effects on school: 1
been gravely injured: 1
i can cite: 1
a wave reflected: 1
a remembrall you: 1
cheerfully carry on: 1
class as you: 1
may communicate his: 1
he'd threatened to: 1
thanks harry said: 1
headed back toward: 1
stories to make: 1
firmly now and: 1
desk so minerva: 1
it too heals: 1
not the most: 1
student requires it: 1
lot see you: 1
celebrity the celebrity: 1
every student of: 1
like to share: 1
her voice wavering: 1
ravenclaws were shooting: 1
hadn't said anything: 1
staring at fawkes: 1
and slammed the: 1
was a brief: 1
was probably the: 1
harry stared at: 1
haul him away: 1
her his voice: 1
said a bezoar: 1
certainly did not: 1
somehow she'd never: 1
course you're in: 1
that harry whispered: 1
doorknob it didn't: 1
point severus was: 1
victims about whom: 1
harry sat there: 1
was still for: 1
i was starting: 1
in the end: 1
glanced down at: 1
in provoking the: 1
voice was unstable: 1
famous discoveries made: 1
reminiscent of lucius: 1
think that this: 1
fred whispered i: 1
to each other: 1
quietus silenced the: 1
this castle for: 1
a twisted smile: 1
of the head: 1
was at least: 1
his list harry: 1
two reports with: 1
should have gotten: 1
the boy you: 1
truth i could: 1
it or was: 1
more that too: 1
him his parents: 1
you under the: 1
would simply kill: 1
or this school: 1
time-turners because they: 1
the headmaster his: 1
the protective shells: 1
part of the: 1
rather like so: 1
crying was not: 1
rather not think: 1
table the look: 1
ravenclaw there was: 1
with lucius about: 1
raise just one: 1
burst of psychic: 1
knew apparently the: 1
all at once: 1
of a goat: 1
or something ah: 1
warm humorous laughter: 1
snape was everyone's: 1
an additional matter: 1
gone both of: 1
really that locked: 1
destroy this potions: 1
doing minerva didn't: 1
risk and i: 1
smartly dressed in: 1
dismay they knew: 1
much harry had: 1
this day from: 1
pardon me i'm: 1
stomach and muggles: 1
other hand was: 1
near where he: 1
muggle books they: 1
which leaves only: 1
that harry allowed: 1
hogwarts does need: 1
seat in ravenclaw: 1
that they survive: 1
with things that: 1
up long enough: 1
down and watch: 1
himself and let: 1
toward gryffindor harry: 1
he sat down: 1
flicked dismissively to: 1
the dropped food: 1
to the deputy: 1
life she glanced: 1
to go to: 1
school discipline as: 1
performed a comic: 1
him whispered the: 1
very smart by: 1
breaker and harry: 1
i can't imagine: 1
out and getting: 1
monday how many: 1
angry i shouldn't: 1
you i'm sorry: 1
i told him: 1
you're not already: 1
older ravenclaw looking: 1
dumbledore didn't react: 1
please follow me: 1
this isn't fair: 1
were as cold: 1
looked nothing remotely: 1
friday morning harry: 1
to croon it: 1
potter a shock: 1
asking questions as: 1
is my punishment: 1
you used it: 1
in her presence: 1
and dumbledore turned: 1
problem but i: 1
winked at him: 1
my fellowship minerva: 1
to me you: 1
let out his: 1
to ask what: 1
correction he may: 1
it could be: 1
to save yourself: 1
go off and: 1
affronted annoyed and: 1
to keep control: 1
us into a: 1
small to be: 1
finally dumbledore spoke: 1
student to every: 1
to eat heavily: 1
gap where a: 1
to you harry: 1
better reason than: 1
taught at my: 1
nothing in the: 1
a rather caressing: 1
actions mr potter: 1
shimmering fumes the: 1
again he needed: 1
he said it: 1
that because then: 1
said that's why: 1
to inform you: 1
school with less: 1
your voice trembles': 1
who is not: 1
wasn't an option: 1
must take them: 1
harry i don't: 1
fear the consequences: 1
which people managed: 1
questioned this while: 1
current century hermione: 1
severus will continue: 1
flatly his gaze: 1
how do you: 1

the older hufflepuffs: 1
and now that: 1
professor what would: 1

my punishment if: 1
he found himself: 1

voice colder than: 1
in retrospect insane: 1
higher to others: 1
and george both: 1
harry's gaze grew: 1
floating in huge: 1
am i to: 1
rid of me: 1
instead of a: 1
regret to inform: 1

quiet voice which: 1
escape it keeps: 1
phoenix said minerva: 1
drinks from themselves: 1
time-turners mr potter: 1

to recognize your: 1
so professor can: 1
at this time: 1
without you and: 1

information potter asphodel: 1
you did this: 1
of a crazy: 1
anything else anyway: 1
pickier when it: 1
him harry was: 1
that you considerably: 1
disregard for school: 1
grave mr potter: 1

probably the utterly: 1
that too is: 1
why you're still: 1
backed us into: 1
used to believe: 1
nothing which i: 1
to manage thanks: 1
should be tremendous: 1
the center of: 1
harry's field of: 1
this problem but: 1
tutors of course: 1
a subordinate child: 1
care to tell: 1
the hall and: 1
true hero and: 1
your actions mr: 1
man stalked between: 1
snape but to: 1
you up afterward: 1
to submit to: 1

any faster anyway: 1
even in restricted: 1

door come in: 1
but if professor: 1
make themselves look: 1
the textbook either: 1
and an inexcusable: 1
let himself think: 1
reading now that: 1
poisons but not: 1

while minerva took: 1
an impossible victory: 1
you'll pick it: 1
is my dark: 1
drink it and: 1
jars on shelves: 1
something was not: 1
in class granger: 1
candle on it: 1
and either hire: 1
harry simply raised: 1
safe - every: 1
face in an: 1
it toward severus: 1

minerva didn't dare: 1
sat in front: 1

other children shrank: 1
amusing conceit how: 1
i really wasn't: 1
went no one: 1
which may be: 1
that harry potter: 1
final threat which: 1
dressed in yellow-trimmed: 1

something about bounties: 1
- some time: 1
up with tears: 1
acromantula but it: 1
briefly at severus: 1
full class his: 1
was mild harry: 1
and it is: 1
he said flatly: 1
to put one: 1
managed before he'd: 1
severus continued as: 1
the end of: 1
behind him harry: 1
the music seemed: 1
it was when: 1
also growing cold: 1
and looked around: 1

down however and: 1
why are you: 1
discipline is necessary: 1
expression he ought: 1
to smile but: 1
it or for: 1
conversation with you: 1

reporting abusive behavior: 1
and then there: 1
magical herbs and: 1
and harry potter: 1

no one seemed: 1
living death as: 1
why minerva swallowed: 1
croon it was: 1
destroying this potions: 1
he wiped away: 1
his voice seemed: 1
and deadly about: 1
down the hall: 1
around the classroom: 1

his brain that: 1

the younger parts: 1

her face was: 1
he was standing: 1
i be punished: 1
from his face: 1
life and now: 1
under pressure from: 1

long enough to: 1
the students at: 1

the time-turner to: 1
fawkes fluttered his: 1
not speak of: 1

today harry gave: 1
the insult told: 1
him rather than: 1
hire a tutor: 1
students against the: 1
along after it: 1
unruly student i: 1
harry's gaze flicked: 1
at her she: 1
won an impossible: 1
hand even higher: 1
continued hovering in: 1
he'd ever managed: 1
your chosen side: 1
it because it: 1
right harry maybe: 1
anything now what: 1
didn't even know: 1
harry had gotten: 1
transfigure some carefully: 1
direction send him: 1
tones of sheer: 1
- shut up: 1
it oh well: 1
of blackmail said: 1
children's desks his: 1
to be briefed: 1
to do anything: 1
a glare which: 1
now professor snape: 1
seen more than: 1
this is insanity: 1
reading minds and: 1
door from the: 1
talking to him: 1
is reporting abusive: 1
said dumbledore it's: 1
again he now: 1
been allowed to: 1
trying hard to: 1
to the left: 1
there smiling thinly: 1
of governers is: 1
thinking about -: 1
was equally icy: 1
then harry said: 1
while severus was: 1
chat with lucius: 1
mr potter how: 1
see you at: 1
and then refuse: 1
ah minerva had: 1
tell me what: 1
here perhaps i: 1
you i can: 1
feelings of students: 1
be required from: 1
are you doing: 1
your offer lucius: 1
be serious severus: 1
slowly you haven't: 1
a comic dance: 1
you lose for: 1
potion so powerful: 1
a ghost to: 1
student in this: 1
matter what hermione: 1
this time minerva: 1
i could chip: 1
asleep again minerva: 1
to get yourself: 1
flicked a hand: 1
harry's imagination was: 1
for the interruption: 1
mind ensnaring the: 1
at her professor: 1
frowns and worried: 1
harry minerva thought: 1
dumbledore echoed why: 1
kill you with: 1
face showed the: 1
some problem you: 1
pure whim of: 1
that had decent: 1
not the boy-who-lived: 1
shock of sudden: 1
in which people: 1
as people could: 1
his coolness wavered: 1
his seat in: 1
said something funny: 1
huge bite out: 1
i will treat: 1
followed harry's lips: 1
any more and: 1
potions professor what: 1
addicted to them: 1
saw professor severus: 1
grimly oh so: 1
elders might frown: 1
you mean let: 1
of the worst: 1
others he will: 1
talk over this: 1
to chest level: 1
potter and in: 1
was something about: 1
tablecloth and each: 1
who you considered: 1
be hogwarts was: 1
of the earth: 1
too small to: 1
and returning from: 1
and higher what: 1
then tried to: 1
as cold as: 1
fashion unbecoming a: 1
if we do: 1
no words came: 1
pardon me and: 1
of the emotional: 1
that it or: 1
been a lot: 1
following this and: 1
i could go: 1
potions while i'm: 1
around all right: 1
that go by: 1
minerva blinked hard: 1
swept his gaze: 1
there are slytherins: 1
feet pattering away: 1
for the unfairness: 1
or not torturing: 1
and moral and: 1
under the impression: 1
that work exactly: 1
dumbledore and if: 1
potter is the: 1
we are a: 1
by your actions: 1
it keeps me: 1
vulnerable have you: 1
with that in: 1
about bounties on: 1
to open the: 1
gasping out loud: 1
the boy smiling: 1
inform you that: 1
think professor mcgonagall: 1
up his message: 1
down said professor: 1
remembered it you: 1
the smarter ones: 1
magical school just: 1
with practice harry: 1
as he spoke: 1
never quite -: 1
lucius values more: 1
harry let out: 1
like so i: 1
the students who: 1
to stay up: 1
root of asphodel: 1
blackmail said dumbledore: 1
one he'd originally: 1
of course -: 1
was when harry: 1
magnitude beyond anything: 1
ghosts tended to: 1
hand and quietus: 1
a dark lord: 1
but there are: 1
his eye but: 1
you doing this: 1
out loud severus: 1
did and i: 1
going to ask: 1
didn't look at: 1
up afterward finished: 1
might be his: 1
severus said a: 1
idea what she: 1
stood beside her: 1
kill you sit: 1
i said that: 1
to have trouble: 1
in enough trouble: 1
wizard's gaze was: 1
became apparent that: 1
a pause as: 1
her addressing her: 1
all because i: 1
the answers to: 1
any candles on: 1
swiftly and less: 1
before him opposite: 1
you that she: 1
i get one: 1
weeping openly so: 1
gotten angry i: 1
a chicken excuse: 1
another hero dumbledore: 1
the sound cut: 1
laughing and if: 1
on the face: 1
learn in the: 1
left her shoulder: 1
after all said: 1
was smiling i: 1
was control not: 1
it would cure: 1
cycle by the: 1
were struggling to: 1
and it showed: 1
sufficed harry gaped: 1
day his brother: 1
deserved dumbledore leaned: 1
really understand the: 1
again severus snape: 1
of the young: 1
about it better: 1
was all you: 1
to other students: 1
twisted in agony: 1
to teach severus: 1
solution to everything: 1
least a plausible: 1
and inside the: 1
a fallen champion: 1
and their parents: 1
of the ravenclaws: 1
which no one: 1
his last bite: 1
bones present and: 1
professor mcgonagall didn't: 1
of study time: 1
poor helpless students: 1
her robes all: 1
hero and she: 1
later harry was: 1
could start a: 1
discipline of the: 1
at fawkes where: 1
and you got: 1
giving her strange: 1
wasn't but if: 1
the headmaster and: 1
irate and that: 1
i think we: 1
just as severus: 1
patterns too i: 1
ghosts it didn't: 1
fontema albeit the: 1
out you're insane: 1
too fast fawkes: 1
smooth motion yanked: 1
completely hopeless said: 1
to be hogwarts: 1
the three of: 1
remember that i: 1
and turned to: 1
bullying or abuse: 1
if i hadn't: 1
acceptable harry said: 1
she'd thought so: 1
interruption please continue: 1
with the blackmail: 1
to be any: 1
along with a: 1
being instead of: 1
and looked up: 1
equally clear what: 1
shells that had: 1
i am being: 1
to think was: 1
been called to: 1
done to earn: 1
magical britain i'm: 1
it came to: 1
jerked away from: 1
is true what: 1
an ironic bow: 1
that harry didn't: 1
look on your: 1
what would i: 1
it this man's: 1
have its evil: 1
about you and: 1
not say such: 1
the corner of: 1
every eye staring: 1
it's the most: 1
on the rotating: 1
harry shrugged acceptable: 1
if you aren't: 1
doing it the: 1
their irreplaceable learning: 1
expected to speak: 1
found in the: 1
had strange preserved: 1
time severus continued: 1
the first and: 1
that potter i: 1
utter contempt minerva: 1
severus's wand was: 1
an inexcusable violation: 1
voice stopped short: 1
flicked in severus's: 1
down in and: 1
it has been: 1
severus were the: 1
at the younger: 1
important questions either: 1
said harry's voice: 1
him the newly: 1
be taught at: 1
said fred we're: 1
what can't say: 1
school has been: 1
minerva was completely: 1
hand into his: 1
the book before: 1
dumbledore was now: 1
know he hadn't: 1
time-turner i will: 1
my newspaper campaign: 1
floo call to: 1
and the points: 1
perspective it is: 1
about if professor: 1
try what is: 1
then i suspect: 1
than it had: 1
not actually have: 1
his existence but: 1
from the look: 1
plate of rashers: 1
go said george: 1
headmaster made a: 1
anything smart to: 1
closets harry had: 1
the matter when: 1
smiling grimly oh: 1
blackmail us this: 1
four layers of: 1
gesture that was: 1
violation of the: 1
point in taking: 1
either harry said: 1
idea - tell: 1
a full hour: 1
have protected them: 1
like that and: 1
guys and don't: 1
to get rid: 1
began to croon: 1
they become addicted: 1
i think professor: 1
if you were: 1
contempt minerva raised: 1
hugged him she: 1
surrounding matter by: 1
to attend hogwarts: 1
again many of: 1
you might've just: 1
said i was: 1
this has become: 1
get along without: 1
moral and important: 1
adjust for the: 1
blinked hard then: 1
a short time: 1
a flash like: 1
and wanting only: 1
about you from: 1
edgewise until ah: 1
give people stopped: 1
so much in: 1
minerva sat behind: 1
make absolutely anything: 1
well said dumbledore: 1
will enchant it: 1
more than my: 1
that her heart: 1
and could get: 1
by the name: 1
just done what: 1
point in crying: 1
all for the: 1
go harry turned: 1
younger my deduction: 1
brought to my: 1
voice deadly you: 1
minerva who said: 1
learn i mean: 1
your punishme- you: 1
that awful why: 1
one daring to: 1
what is that: 1
be bullied by: 1
yellow-trimmed robes and: 1
and left at: 1
for your time-turner: 1
hire private tutors: 1
take their lesson: 1
of sadness she'd: 1
requires it hogwarts: 1
calories as he: 1
unlikely that you: 1
ability to carry: 1
lucius foisted him: 1
was an empty: 1
this or not: 1
frozen in absolute: 1
the current status: 1
this and she: 1
life ghosts tended: 1
after you were: 1
dumbledore shook his: 1
a way out: 1
most people who: 1
field of vision: 1
paused although harry: 1
very faint burning: 1
you about to: 1
down and hugged: 1
literally wasn't sentient: 1
he remembered to: 1
so now harry's: 1
down at his: 1
hadn't seemed very: 1
anger or dismay: 1
harry didn't look: 1
painful and he: 1
the one who: 1
you will be: 1
a good idea: 1
teacher if they: 1
its optionality harry: 1
really wasn't but: 1
the classroom i: 1
less impolite when: 1
harry said that: 1
that no sound: 1
c-l-o-a-k his fingers: 1
more than just: 1
to voldemort if: 1
one here is: 1
took a deep: 1
from a professor: 1
the dungeons for: 1
in your dreams: 1
met so far: 1
at least until: 1
he wants hermione: 1
sort of expression: 1
cut off his: 1
she hadn't seemed: 1
aren't as great: 1
pack of fools: 1
think he's part: 1
smiled again threat's: 1
yanked open a: 1
history class was: 1
potions classroom and: 1
voice sounding genuinely: 1
courtesy or you: 1
three orders of: 1
the start of: 1
silent the phoenix: 1
books final try: 1
- you forget: 1
thought he was: 1
flatly but in: 1
collected stories to: 1
side the boy: 1
found himself beholding: 1
said her voice: 1
well and now: 1
said will you: 1
their parents a: 1
his face turned: 1
conversation grows private: 1
your example as: 1
it i saw: 1
tell the students: 1
no let us: 1
he walked over: 1
front of that: 1
piece opposing lucius: 1
in yellow-trimmed robes: 1
i guessed and: 1
stop please it's: 1
all mr potter: 1
felt her throat: 1
so was professor: 1
warmth through her: 1
was unstable wobbling: 1
of nothing which: 1
as compared to: 1
current salary two: 1
becoming harder and: 1
reports with the: 1
can hardly be: 1
and collected stories: 1
about that because: 1
whispered hermione frantically: 1
starting to wonder: 1
no sound but: 1
enough trouble for: 1
severus did but: 1
he started laughing: 1
that this potions: 1
then you seemed: 1
per day then: 1
to be wearing: 1
the back of: 1
his house and: 1
weight of meaning: 1
but what could: 1
the ravenclaws were: 1
now stern this: 1
every centimeter of: 1
returning from some: 1
us that professor: 1
tell the other: 1
severus potter where: 1
to any of: 1
to him again: 1
entered minerva almost: 1
walked the rest: 1
master or you: 1
communicate his concerns: 1
throat and no: 1
lump in her: 1
face that was: 1
have you all: 1
earlier they had: 1
my part minerva: 1
first rejoinder that: 1
spine something was: 1
publicly apologize for: 1
basement some of: 1
have done if: 1
strike at my: 1
gaze over the: 1
to be wavering: 1
find another potions: 1
stare at dumbledore: 1
anything he'd ever: 1
for several hours: 1
completely enraged he: 1
brain that scarfing: 1
even stopper death: 1
teacher's desk and: 1
said about ghosts: 1
i'm leaving does: 1
time-turner his imagination: 1
i rather like: 1
that crossed harry's: 1
him again he: 1
my behavior requires: 1
sudden understanding -: 1
was as shocked: 1
my attention he: 1
said severus minerva: 1
was that in: 1
bottle fame brew: 1
was that if: 1
as his face: 1
if they died: 1
the outermost orbital: 1
earplugs did ghosts: 1
was that it: 1
and fear the: 1
with flawless elegance: 1
and held up: 1
said fred we: 1
and doing the: 1
clear and its: 1
is not sufficient: 1
briefly before it: 1
to learn the: 1
as what dad: 1
had considered many: 1
wanted harry stared: 1
snape today is: 1
voice from somewhere: 1
them i am: 1
to start with: 1
in and scrawled: 1
sure i can: 1
she would not: 1
now sit down: 1
the closet was: 1
doesn't it said: 1
of lucius although: 1
anger others of: 1
him hermione harry: 1
energy accompanying a: 1
motion fingers poised: 1
his own castle: 1
that the purpose: 1
preemptory he certainly: 1
would not have: 1
had almost gone: 1
injured by your: 1
just saved me: 1
meet anyone's eyes: 1
wolfsbane they are: 1
you decide that: 1
minerva said will: 1
and i'll be: 1
their arms to: 1
recover but that: 1
she paused that: 1
you aren't as: 1
she felt the: 1
could chip in: 1
call school discipline: 1
her from her: 1
scourgify as students: 1
i think you've: 1
in a rather: 1
potter you underestimate: 1
raise it high: 1
to school discipline: 1
minerva's body swayed: 1
had happened way: 1
struggling to stay: 1
said george yes: 1
to professor mcgonagall: 1
own words harry's: 1
impose lax discipline: 1
do anything about: 1
here george and: 1
is magic i: 1
still stands but: 1
whispered severus and: 1
after it became: 1
fascinating muggle books: 1
school will fall: 1
maybe you're right: 1
harry's mind when: 1
his toast it: 1
ghosts or much: 1
this then is: 1
called the next: 1
everyone are you: 1
even harder he: 1
empty desk not: 1
silence minerva didn't: 1
an obstinate child: 1
you're insane potter: 1
in magical drafts: 1
to stare at: 1
a letter to: 1
closet was empty: 1
there are some: 1
then he lifted: 1
four he said: 1
fool dumbledore didn't: 1
the assassin swept: 1
the boy's face: 1
half the class: 1
and memorized speech: 1
where can i: 1
teacher who literally: 1
respect in all: 1
in severus's direction: 1
voice sounded a: 1
discoveries made by: 1
her desk so: 1
student it is: 1
severus smiled in: 1
let all the: 1
slytherins threatening me: 1
door stepped in: 1
legilimency said dumbledore: 1
much the same: 1
in a pocket: 1
uncertain his face: 1
of explosives might: 1
a school with: 1
hogwarts i won't: 1
heard one report: 1
just attending their: 1
and remembered the: 1
abusive professors or: 1
stern maybe it: 1
missing something sudden: 1
his hand in: 1
at hogwarts harry: 1
failed to control: 1
a weight of: 1
to teach history: 1
creepier i can: 1
pattern that hogwarts: 1
how easily injured: 1
ah yes because: 1
could possess they: 1
not made of: 1
he took from: 1

slightest bit sympathetic: 1
in edgewise until: 1

and impose lax: 1
six long strides: 1
going out and: 1
how about if: 1

an extra hour: 1
around the time-turner's: 1
she could see: 1
albeit the fifty-centimeter: 1
burning sensation in: 1

as one might: 1
with fawkes if: 1

all this seeming: 1
sessions will be: 1

my house connections: 1
too harry had: 1
been a number: 1
beautiful dumbledore said: 1

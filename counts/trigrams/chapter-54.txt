him gerard mccusker: 1
things were slowly: 1
way to win: 1
his seven of: 1

a second later: 1
- that was: 1
block anything blockable: 1
as she drew: 1

he no longer: 1
as quietly as: 1
for his minor: 1
word innervate before: 1
his cheeks he: 1
step just beneath: 1
despair i'm ugly: 1
remember - can't: 1
and then it: 1
away his wand: 1
lips he just: 1
warn you that: 1
time for one: 1
and gone up: 1
blaze the disillusionment: 1
without him even: 1
his life instead: 1
he was watching: 1
out i scan: 1
up at bahry: 1
sudden sense of: 1
i can be: 1
around the table: 1
he'd managed to: 1
knew that this: 1
the sallow bearded: 1
turned his head: 1
could picture it: 1
too must not: 1
blowing dust out: 1
the punchline they'd: 1
the full magnitude: 1
him and screamed: 1
red robes coming: 1
chance at some: 1
toward the boy: 1

only had seven: 1
normal patrol so: 1
mutter the healing: 1
the iron calm: 1
long enough to: 1
for bahry's frantic: 1
cloth from his: 1
he just couldn't: 1
tears the voice: 1
pressed his wand: 1
a minute against: 1
rough throat -: 1
as the bright: 1

a small patronus: 1
he he the: 1
good and who: 1

a serious opponent: 1
stair further below: 1
no reason to: 1
a much gentler: 1
bother with anti-disillusionment: 1
by far the: 1
inhalation like a: 1
fraction of a: 1
art of dueling: 1
and the smile: 1
and anti-harmonized in: 1
say in front: 1
and was staring: 1
second maybe for: 1
their chairs around: 1

cloak of invisibility: 1
thin horror rising: 1
not to at: 1
consequences of what: 1
excellent game of: 1
what was happening: 1
knee and one: 1
dark lord's most: 1
like a thousand: 1
a wife and: 1

and professor quirrell: 1
fewer years of: 1

from his robe: 1
unfolded like spreading: 1
take a knut: 1
to cost you: 1
as mccusker grabbed: 1
bahry barely stopped: 1
together through azkaban: 1
wand without there: 1

time to do: 1
the sense of: 1
from behind if: 1

it not blocked: 1
the pot bahry: 1
horrified silence and: 1
the wells of: 1
energy to press: 1
man's falling body: 1

falling body and: 1
who could break: 1
none of them: 1

harry saw it: 1
harry was the: 1
pain in his: 1

not i can't: 1
that much the: 1
trickling down his: 1
robes trying to: 1
silver sickle he: 1
the explosion came: 1
well even if: 1
and solid enough: 1

entities invisible they: 1
gone back down: 1
impossible shape before: 1

smiled dryly and: 1
trying to crush: 1
i could punish: 1

words the few: 1
protest bahry ignored: 1
went through the: 1
in a shot: 1
you don't five: 1
be unconscious he: 1
and mccusker might: 1

don't ask foolish: 1
i had a: 1
much-diminished stunbolt still: 1
boy pretending to: 1
that delicate from: 1
silver shape of: 1
pocket or rip: 1
a fulfillment of: 1
his shining patronus: 1
a deadly pressure: 1
all the deepest: 1
even - when: 1
of his battle: 1
master two death: 1
central pit of: 1
i see bahry: 1
should have took: 1
you see something: 1
on that bearded: 1
and everyone called: 1
the metal floor: 1

dueling consisted of: 1
what are you: 1
- they couldn't: 1
but harry knew: 1
you kill them: 1
mysterious terrible thing: 1
even thinking it: 1
see in the: 1
frantic panting his: 1
back in harry: 1
in the interior: 1
fancy red robes: 1
silver as he: 1
mike instead he'd: 1
you won't even: 1
old old muggle: 1
and looked his: 1
with the sound: 1
languages that would: 1
duel it had: 1
you would have: 1
hardly make out: 1
said bahry his: 1
been a duel: 1
it was already: 1
white forms paced: 1
away replaced by: 1
professor quirrell my: 1
their pit but: 1
part of harry: 1
to hunt down: 1
saw the form: 1
exhibition duels between: 1
the silhouette said: 1
throat it took: 1
it had apparated: 1
crap thought harry: 1
harry had seen: 1
chairs around the: 1
stare at the: 1
needed to take: 1
business but bahry: 1
feeling came over: 1
them the man: 1
invisible but you: 1
nail in her: 1
a sigh and: 1
sense it more: 1
pit and was: 1
year as a: 1
and it occurred: 1
the skeleton of: 1
bahry one-hand had: 1
sounds she was: 1
so many other: 1
make those words: 1
a duel it: 1
you're really not: 1
for his poor: 1
patronus followed after: 1
harry's heart he'd: 1
in azkaban would: 1
toward the man's: 1
already hitting them: 1
never heard anything: 1
it's real said: 1
at - the: 1
stunner spell fired: 1
use for you: 1
in harry's heart: 1
would flare especially: 1
didn't know the: 1
through but i: 1
his wand but: 1
we talk about: 1
polyjuiced defense professor: 1
silver badger had: 1
- can't remember: 1
just a fraction: 1
harry potter the: 1
still - have: 1
one precious moment: 1
and walked away: 1
the gates inside: 1
the man's wand: 1
that seemed like: 1
and then pronouncing: 1
more - the: 1
- my love: 1
loud in the: 1
at the traumatized: 1
to five hundred: 1
the wand look: 1
the whole corridor: 1
auror li would: 1
how strange be: 1
this was not: 1
lord's most terrible: 1
auror but now: 1
and turned into: 1
not lost something: 1
if you failed: 1
my lord there: 1
a crushing sense: 1
bellatrix's voice and: 1
harry turned to: 1
his wand downward: 1
trouble for your: 1
second bottle of: 1
of the metal: 1
nothing else might: 1
three aurors who: 1
spell - and: 1
was the saddest: 1
cutting glass as: 1
that his own: 1

hogwarts robes and: 1
son you're really: 1
he couldn't see: 1

mad-eye moody couldn't: 1
but - i'm: 1
yourself or you'll: 1
was trying to: 1
alive an awful: 1
their spells ever: 1
move very slowly: 1
you seem confused: 1
a second before: 1
felt it the: 1
to drop the: 1
a giggle that: 1
they ever cast: 1
poker though it: 1
his dislocated left: 1
was after her: 1
come harry reached: 1
boy's face emerged: 1
took him that: 1
red sparks and: 1
man it was: 1
professor quirrell and: 1
probably shouldn't ought: 1
heard anything so: 1
no way that: 1
moment maybe even: 1
voice a young: 1
harry could hardly: 1
with mccusker and: 1
said mccusker what's: 1
suit staring in: 1
got too close: 1
details but harry: 1
the 5300s it: 1
wand at the: 1
five four -: 1
of harry's patronus: 1
and for him: 1
the auror but: 1
as of wind: 1
much i love: 1
long inhalation like: 1
she had been: 1
gone up another: 1
up another four: 1
light every exposed: 1
at once against: 1
his ground and: 1
sallow bearded man: 1
third bar of: 1
harry recognized were: 1
against bahry alone: 1
another step forward: 1
reply which was: 1
wasn't that good: 1
don't there was: 1
the light blazed: 1
owner of a: 1
a silver sickle: 1
in the reflections: 1
figure would flare: 1
in harry was: 1
was the beginning: 1
the energy to: 1
his mirror and: 1
caught you by: 1
called for sending: 1
better his only: 1

only consolation besides: 1
to move his: 1
split second of: 1
breaking point his: 1
much too loud: 1
his hand outstretched: 1

family to support: 1
lips even began: 1
living skeleton that: 1
hurt their ears: 1
it was shattered: 1
li had been: 1

remembered that it: 1
dislocated left shoulder: 1
if you two: 1
quite make out: 1
make out the: 1
saturday in february: 1
the jolt of: 1
his eyes were: 1
charm people with: 1
if you got: 1
harry his imagination: 1
if he'd thought: 1
the whole mirror: 1
- stay still: 1
her coffin the: 1
coming down the: 1
crying bellatrix black: 1
was happening but: 1
if i'm no: 1
mirror lay dull: 1
form the question: 1
retirement mad-eye moody: 1
his opponent he: 1
left before his: 1
wasn't too hard: 1
be hard not: 1
and nothing happened: 1
mirror and wingardium: 1
it all seemed: 1
loss of his: 1
the whole lot: 1
red bolt struck: 1
voice no longer: 1
you came -: 1
tried willing it: 1
you can attack: 1
to hand thirty: 1
the form of: 1
of doom rising: 1
to understand even: 1
at bahry's stunner: 1
palm pretty hard: 1
spat something unspeakable: 1
supporting himself as: 1
dementors had actually: 1
of utter exhaustion: 1
was sobbing harder: 1
rough voice of: 1
of partial transfiguration: 1
wizard ever to: 1
enough to stay: 1
spell going at: 1
or seven and: 1
if my lord: 1
bahry was already: 1
was to shoot: 1
as it unfolded: 1
the obvious didn't: 1
bellatrix black and: 1
sound of another: 1
mike i need: 1
the word innervate: 1
it just above: 1
through harry's heart: 1
with friends in: 1
them usually stuck: 1
two knuts and: 1
it and solid: 1
sob escaped her: 1
back down bahry's: 1
down his spine: 1
in the blaze: 1
now burned like: 1
way they'd come: 1
and exhausted and: 1
- though i: 1
heard the bright: 1
had failed he: 1
wand had moved: 1
a grim smile: 1
followed a brilliant: 1
sorry they ate: 1
drop the invisibility: 1
had seven months: 1
position to block: 1
couldn't i knew: 1
could before he: 1
idly curious and: 1
didn't have anything: 1
bahry said whoever: 1
to rest on: 1
last despair i'm: 1
to you i: 1
fallen to the: 1
sound as of: 1
command room as: 1
the mirror lay: 1
brighter and brighter: 1
he'd just seen: 1
looking up at: 1
and vanished entirely: 1
his only consolation: 1
mere magic that: 1
moment later bahry's: 1
man became visible: 1
forward reaching out: 1
want to see: 1
look son you're: 1
refuse the understanding: 1
metal doors but: 1
hand into position: 1
as much as: 1
except a two: 1
dragons and sevens: 1
with nearly a: 1
young boy's face: 1
voice taking on: 1
ordinary moonlight that: 1
dark lord he: 1
her cell there: 1
spoken words and: 1
without emphasis auror: 1
the aurors to: 1
who'd gone on: 1
to hire a: 1
silence bahry to: 1
to use me: 1
the dreadful flux: 1
- and in: 1
auror trying to: 1
for some way: 1
his opponent had: 1
wavered - brightened: 1
before his retirement: 1
killed by a: 1
hard voice come: 1
coming from didn't: 1
point his instincts: 1
mere eyes could: 1
him but that: 1
his right hand: 1
away with five: 1
whispered bellatrix just: 1
of adrenaline to: 1
really not supposed: 1
resonate out of: 1
turned to bellatrix: 1
they passed the: 1
like someone was: 1
harry had destroyed: 1
and scream no: 1
metal cutting glass: 1
love you it: 1
by healing light: 1
make me cast: 1
terrified whisper help: 1
even through his: 1
was stillness and: 1
and kill him: 1
put it back: 1
above it that: 1
self that was: 1
the servant levitated: 1
above him if: 1
threads of fire: 1
afford to grease: 1
could hear it: 1
in the air: 1
called it if: 1
maybe i can: 1
blue-trimmed hogwarts robes: 1
in midair and: 1
sun an only: 1
that scream choked: 1
half he'd felt: 1
that didn't seem: 1
floated through the: 1
the window staring: 1
him mike instead: 1
dazed mind noticed: 1
to a point: 1
to say in: 1
a chill running: 1
he continued to: 1
been trying but: 1
do anything no: 1
and walk away: 1
turn around and: 1
incantations that harry: 1
of the much-diminished: 1
silently but now: 1
it they both: 1
not countered not: 1
was breathing the: 1
he didn't think: 1
him for it: 1
his mind and: 1
said bellatrix her: 1
brightened - the: 1
have took far: 1
fired in sheer: 1
to scratch the: 1
as bahry slashed: 1
that strange noises: 1
then pronouncing words: 1
this do you: 1
the auror spat: 1
it was might: 1
spiral if you: 1
room keeping their: 1
into place harry: 1
with any more: 1
beside him on: 1
his belt it's: 1
skeletally thin horror: 1
trying not to: 1

how much this: 1
last moments of: 1
large enough that: 1
sunlight the air: 1
about this kind: 1
patrol so it: 1
fight what good: 1

it had suddenly: 1
table from him: 1
spark moved forward: 1
to hear the: 1
the snake he: 1
lord's servant it: 1
by a patronus: 1
a single word: 1
a brilliant silver: 1
final offer said: 1

and both lights: 1
for what you've: 1
best hand of: 1
bellatrix's invisible body: 1
man now clearly: 1
lestranges won't want: 1

had turned away: 1
just above the: 1
those words pass: 1
man should not: 1

bahry's mind was: 1
that surrounded his: 1
his heart please: 1

police officer harry: 1
pointed his wand: 1
two don't mind: 1
back the way: 1
patronus flickered -: 1
the man hadn't: 1
happened my lord: 1
stunner was currently: 1
- shut it: 1
holding back so: 1
even then it: 1
hard his knuckles: 1
of what he: 1

maybe if my: 1
wife and the: 1
thought frantically attack: 1
the air turned: 1

another cracking egg: 1
was obedience the: 1
and he sometimes: 1
only slightly dimmer: 1

screaming screaming screaming: 1
or rip off: 1
it was after: 1
who caught you: 1

any time to: 1
flashes his mirror's: 1

forgotten that he'd: 1
mirror and show: 1
at him he: 1
mccusker's bright anteater: 1
probably couldn't have: 1
the red bolt: 1
some terrible breaking: 1
and then sighed: 1
and then the: 1
the barracks one: 1
when they passed: 1
greater danger had: 1
left of his: 1
but i need: 1
patronus brighter and: 1
out on bahry's: 1

dull and lifeless: 1
but it always: 1
it should have: 1
it took him: 1
the words went: 1
harry heard it: 1
to collapse to: 1
of that moonlight: 1
strengthened crap thought: 1
real trouble the: 1
silence except for: 1
four flights of: 1
from snarling at: 1
he could sense: 1
bahry might have: 1
shielding torn away: 1
quirrell's magic matched: 1
you've been through: 1
galleons said the: 1

drop the cloak: 1
professor the essential: 1
the death-eaters hadn't: 1

the terrified voice: 1
though professor quirrell: 1
harry's mind felt: 1
fading fading into: 1
an entreating hand: 1
the human skeleton: 1
had no place: 1
motionless on the: 1
and harder part: 1
step forward and: 1
that harry was: 1
knuts and a: 1
and bahry saw: 1
easiest way to: 1
go there wasn't: 1
scene was still: 1
trying to suppress: 1

bahry could feel: 1
accompanied by a: 1
rest on a: 1
kidnapped me to: 1
and use any: 1
of a boy: 1
he only had: 1
said a hard: 1
your servants -: 1

his knees brought: 1
table and so: 1
had to do: 1
who's behind me: 1
years on the: 1
rate and more: 1
time for harry: 1

stabbing through harry's: 1
their poker hand: 1
pitch darkness by: 1
silver figure all: 1
it's real yes: 1
bahry had already: 1
walked away with: 1
something - he: 1
of doom clashed: 1
to survive a: 1
use to you: 1
here and he: 1
an auror with: 1
of rock large: 1
the dementors' fear: 1
became visible then: 1
since no dementors: 1
was the final: 1
at his head: 1
simulating the dark: 1
scream no no: 1
the silver light: 1
and believe me: 1
a whim of: 1
shields already raised: 1
more formal voice: 1
the auror all: 1
talk to you: 1
communicator to call: 1
want to hurt: 1
there wasn't a: 1
it would be: 1
hard voice of: 1
he hated this: 1
blood and for: 1
more hardness fight: 1
large with three: 1
the boy-who-lived he: 1
felt it his: 1
now clearly visible: 1
had passed and: 1
straight down to: 1
game of dragon: 1

silver humanoid stayed: 1
potter emerged from: 1
breath for quiet: 1
to make it: 1
power of partial: 1

gave them all: 1
from seeing it: 1
could prove fatal: 1
he could see: 1
ways that were: 1
and the living: 1
absolute silver as: 1
of harry's life: 1
screaming in disbelieving: 1
auror halted after: 1
then it was: 1
hand just as: 1
twisted lightly beneath: 1
the green spark: 1
faster than on: 1
even now it's: 1
it in exchange: 1
just as the: 1
like a deadly: 1
and there were: 1
on his belt: 1
voice until i: 1
care if that's: 1
start using area-effect: 1
terrible breaking point: 1
a serious fight: 1
stray fire his: 1
running down his: 1
cloak and drop: 1
you don't ask: 1
poker and didn't: 1
hard if he: 1
pleasse are you: 1

like a white: 1
only briefly saw: 1
failed shocked dismayed: 1
one who caught: 1
convince the aurors: 1
and wavering like: 1
before flicking to: 1
after him and: 1
the scene was: 1
feelings were coming: 1
a speck of: 1
to shoot the: 1
poker hand first: 1
unfolding invisibility cloak: 1
lay down beside: 1
cold metal feeling: 1
the pace and: 1
i entered azkaban: 1

maybe relieve one: 1
of the brilliant: 1
i'm not i: 1
going to make: 1
yes my lord: 1
was the mysterious: 1
- what did: 1
before they raised: 1
clutching an eleven-inch: 1
that wand before: 1

and just stretched: 1
of them giving: 1
weak said bellatrix's: 1
i can't be: 1

mccusker might beat: 1
for one desperate: 1
bribe for li: 1
able to understand: 1
a fraction of: 1
foolish questions but: 1
seemed to move: 1
looked up from: 1
casting what except: 1
against the dementors: 1
was no charm: 1
that death itself: 1
understand for the: 1
bahry alone it: 1
able to use: 1
stopped holding back: 1
in a colder: 1
it too must: 1
place bellatrix was: 1
of a joke: 1
and silence harry: 1
current set of: 1
think only time: 1
auror had fallen: 1
rising to a: 1
and his right: 1
you're ready or: 1
ought to say: 1
beneath him for: 1
a curved mirror: 1
before bahry could: 1
turn to attack: 1
the same downward: 1
might have reached: 1
the lips of: 1
it harry knew: 1
kao which hopefully: 1
huge metal doors: 1
crushed in on: 1
growled bahry he: 1
a moment for: 1
brighter than any: 1
of harry's self: 1
is out of: 1
their three patronuses: 1
on professor quirrell: 1
entreaty and the: 1
managed to stun: 1
of horrified silence: 1
lightly beneath bahry's: 1
- you were: 1
through azkaban if: 1
until i stop: 1
them by and: 1
was torn apart: 1
be smart said: 1
li tore out: 1
in just to: 1
hit by a: 1
seemingly empty corridor: 1
face two at: 1
yes thought the: 1
for sending the: 1
below she had: 1
right five times: 1
in the distance: 1
bare breath of: 1
how this works: 1
a hard male: 1
any more -: 1
thirty seconds later: 1
it tiny pathetic: 1
pit but harry: 1
be operating on: 1
his onrushing death: 1
sinking feeling came: 1
the sudden sense: 1
just seen the: 1
belt it's been: 1
whenever you're ready: 1
to regret not: 1
to understand to: 1
breathing the last: 1
any more hardness: 1
close enough range: 1
metal step just: 1
began to come: 1
of the sparks: 1
he'd never heard: 1
far from him: 1
wasn't looking at: 1
walking because harry: 1
little better now: 1
could have lasted: 1
only wizard ever: 1
wand against the: 1
won't even be: 1
twenty fewer years: 1
as the boy: 1
shall need to: 1

you can walk: 1
which let him: 1
of it was: 1
as he saw: 1
stopped himself from: 1
trained by their: 1
patronus as it: 1
counter in time: 1
red blasts deflecting: 1
now how strange: 1
and thin and: 1
spun on his: 1
in the same: 1
me back -: 1
- but the: 1
instead he overrode: 1
light collided and: 1
except - stay: 1
back harry had: 1
bahry's remaining palm: 1
drawing out red: 1
visible in the: 1
corridors and the: 1
at you while: 1
you would come: 1
hadn't raised any: 1
skin beneath his: 1
being any way: 1
it took more: 1
against the world: 1
were squeezing harry's: 1
the question it's: 1
had seen exhibition: 1
dark master two: 1
seen the boy-who-lived: 1
small touch of: 1
will and gave: 1
his retirement the: 1
fuel in the: 1
wand before i: 1
from a meter: 1
aurors who were: 1
didn't think of: 1
couldn't take -: 1
back on his: 1
not to collapse: 1
the sweat-soaked blue-trimmed: 1
moment later a: 1
had been blocked: 1
heavily steadied his: 1
rhythm of it: 1
harry's life as: 1
and without emphasis: 1
green bars of: 1
on duty in: 1
the wild wizardry: 1
clearly visible in: 1
so far above: 1
punchline they'd gone: 1
them all from: 1
wand bahry repeated: 1
his robes brushed: 1
and behind it: 1
of his spirit: 1
harry still invisible: 1
you were almost: 1
magic and professor: 1
it sounded much: 1
flicking them away: 1
pressure began to: 1
death so bahry: 1
and darkness pressed: 1
what he had: 1
of hell just: 1
cast the patronus: 1
voice without him: 1
the pit and: 1
cast my patronus: 1
fear was taking: 1
shield at least: 1
reflex hit it: 1
footsteps and saw: 1
always in hand: 1
in azkaban blazing: 1
almost unrecognizable it: 1
harm's way said: 1
might be unconscious: 1
to be pouring: 1
enough to let: 1
a faint green: 1
a half-day's worth: 1
short of mandatory: 1
invisibility out of: 1
just above him: 1
shining patronus followed: 1
them away with: 1
sending the three: 1
not deflected caught: 1
to destroy them: 1
she had no: 1
seconds to drop: 1
taking that -: 1
open his lips: 1
now a grim: 1
invisible once more: 1
of razors and: 1
her from the: 1
was a pause: 1
officer harry pointed: 1
have blinked instead: 1
horror trying to: 1
and screaming starting: 1
that the spell: 1

then it might: 1
i'm weak said: 1
and gone back: 1
for your servants: 1
shielding it was: 1
slightly dimmer shadow: 1
and harry knew: 1
stay still said: 1
was perfect they'd: 1
the prisoners were: 1
to go there: 1
it was waxing: 1
or albus bloody: 1
different like the: 1
auror coming it: 1
exactly five seconds: 1
into her voice: 1
or i start: 1
if that was: 1
much you can: 1
to give someone: 1
dreadful flux and: 1
and bahry's stunner: 1

almost the whole: 1
that - mike: 1
azkaban one auror: 1

disinterested voice that: 1
show yourself or: 1
walk away big: 1
as bahry was: 1
you had to: 1
was might be: 1
with harry's steel: 1
saw his terrible: 1
voice like a: 1
if he'd had: 1
iron calm of: 1
of a competent: 1
me - even: 1
the last seconds: 1
traveling together through: 1
hopefully would serve: 1
head and screaming: 1
orientation while it: 1
from close enough: 1
passed one of: 1

life instead he: 1
was too tired: 1
of corridor turned: 1
want it to: 1
beginning of a: 1
shields so that: 1
where the auror: 1
and his mouth: 1
needed to recast: 1
to go past: 1
already raised and: 1
it his magic: 1
bahry's stunner was: 1
shape before the: 1
top the cold: 1
by and then: 1
had anyone blocked: 1
played poker and: 1
hurt me until: 1
charm bahry had: 1
not be seen: 1
bahry try not: 1
back where three: 1
come - to: 1

fear the three: 1
servants - even: 1
stairs showed that: 1
duty here triple: 1
all up i'm: 1
the green eyes: 1
you it was: 1
air screamed like: 1
the auror halted: 1
rose up at: 1
wanted it to: 1
be silent -: 1
table cards toward: 1
who had done: 1
criminal you don't: 1
but the scene: 1
screaming screaming clutching: 1
out the window: 1
bellatrix was crying: 1
would white out: 1
a little better: 1
robe or bite: 1
come out too: 1
- never -: 1
stopped walking because: 1
words went unheard: 1
from bellatrix's throat: 1
taking all of: 1
imagination could picture: 1
a defensive position: 1
corps-a-corps with unicorns: 1
all other entities: 1
utter exhaustion he: 1
where you could've: 1
be useful any: 1
trio was resting: 1
his belt -: 1
defenses that would: 1
striving against the: 1
doom that was: 1
attack whenever you're: 1
and who what: 1
years of experience: 1
incantation and frantically: 1
formal voice he: 1
dimmer shadow moved: 1
man wasn't looking: 1
bright purpose nothing: 1
silent - he: 1
it said bellatrix: 1
pay if he: 1
in the mirror: 1
fallen to his: 1
calm once she: 1
red robes his: 1
who could cast: 1
mates played an: 1
he'd ever seen: 1
to point a: 1
eyes the glasses: 1
you were alive: 1
his best hand: 1
and bruises or: 1
to make me: 1
and flicked his: 1
to grease bahry's: 1
to bellatrix -: 1
the man threw: 1
the man sounded: 1
confused about how: 1
happening so slowly: 1
scramble back to: 1
was snoring in: 1
to keep the: 1
led to the: 1
of control -: 1
wand's end twisted: 1
or even to: 1
so it was: 1
hunt down the: 1
spat something that: 1
anyone could possibly: 1
stairs leading down: 1
wavering in the: 1
inside him and: 1
killing curse had: 1
have called it: 1
too small and: 1
his battle surrender: 1
screaming clutching at: 1
two one stupefy: 1
had shields already: 1
distance then the: 1
form deliberately point: 1
death eaters at: 1
a trainee auror: 1
- he should: 1
by any shield: 1
aside not knowing: 1
small and harry: 1
felt numbed looking: 1
it clearly the: 1
a hand to: 1
face looked frightened: 1
the window you: 1
harry thought frantically: 1
wild but before: 1
away with his: 1
the table the: 1
who could have: 1
little hard to: 1
spells unable to: 1
burning tearing pain: 1
a chance at: 1
terrible thing that: 1
what i forgot: 1
and harry had: 1
had destroyed a: 1
maybe even not: 1
boy whispered somnium: 1
dust out of: 1
i forgot -: 1
sun but that: 1
sounds it didn't: 1
because harry had: 1
back to their: 1
same downward direction: 1
didn't recognize now: 1
and da and: 1
he probably shouldn't: 1
the ministry even: 1
scream was continuing: 1
five seconds to: 1
stuck to the: 1
and more of: 1
it unfolded like: 1
this was wizardry: 1
snoring in the: 1
danger had passed: 1
my lord brighter: 1
the rough throat: 1
like there was: 1
said the dark: 1
pump into his: 1
lips of a: 1
must stop it: 1
like anything he'd: 1
it didn't see: 1
and lay down: 1
gravelly voice the: 1
in the name: 1
that sounded like: 1
legion but the: 1
uncertainty striving against: 1
harry his rage: 1
showing the sweat-soaked: 1
quirrell my spell: 1
to do anything: 1
to reassure her: 1
but bahry had: 1
step from the: 1
his first year: 1
professor quirrell invisibly: 1
try not to: 1
sky there sure: 1
harry was just: 1
a huge gasp: 1
for this do: 1
at once two: 1
of his pocket: 1
the sun brightening: 1
lord who would: 1
more layers on: 1
bellatrix had finished: 1
to scramble back: 1
partial transfiguration this: 1
of his chair: 1
she was invisible: 1
the metal corridors: 1
a dementor modifier: 1
and then bahry's: 1
what had just: 1
if you don't: 1
had suddenly become: 1
magnitude of the: 1
likely to go: 1
try to kill: 1
believe me if: 1
way to reassure: 1
whole mirror and: 1
bellatrix tonality had: 1
him than it: 1
to disperse them: 1
let his patronus: 1
could punish you: 1
said bellatrix's voice: 1
seven and that: 1
front if you: 1
before his brain: 1
desperately aside and: 1
forms appearing and: 1
the voice avada: 1
maybe for harry: 1
smart said the: 1
most terrible weapon: 1
set of defenses: 1
the auror's shielding: 1
lord froze you: 1
somnium harry stared: 1
stupefy bahry stared: 1
wanted to hunt: 1
could have seen: 1
shields green bars: 1
you would never: 1
could skip that: 1
seconds later harry: 1
lord who had: 1
was likely to: 1
of her cell: 1
the much-diminished stunbolt: 1
disillusionment said a: 1
stop and nothing: 1
stun his opponent: 1
5 366th game: 1
as he staggered: 1
suppress even now: 1
- thank you: 1
picture it clearly: 1
figure stood before: 1
from its watch: 1
as a trainee: 1
the burning tearing: 1
glasses and the: 1
flux of magic: 1
anything left for: 1
around and walk: 1
you bahry said: 1
are you doing: 1
of doom that: 1
the seemingly empty: 1
hex like a: 1
could not have: 1
azkaban against the: 1
it he realized: 1
ticked away he: 1
overrode the impulse: 1
reaching out an: 1
february and there: 1
ministry even as: 1
use for me: 1
me the man: 1
seventh-year armies put: 1
been quite a: 1
his shields so: 1
first li won: 1
enough to destroy: 1
fight - professor: 1
this case and: 1
lord the silhouette: 1
in exchange for: 1
shields - the: 1
washcloth trying to: 1
that an innocent: 1
fading into ordinary: 1
hand slowly bahry: 1
her voice no: 1
back into a: 1
hissed harry's voice: 1
prisoners in their: 1
bahry bahry barely: 1
he the part: 1
raked in the: 1
ground one knee: 1
everything had failed: 1
aurors who'd gone: 1
hadn't had a: 1
the distance then: 1
that harry recognized: 1
their dark master: 1
a colder more: 1
now show yourself: 1
shown them all: 1
starting to click: 1
the step just: 1
first cast a: 1
and so they: 1
was no reply: 1

bahry's stunner where: 1
had been the: 1
spell into all: 1
desperate wish that: 1
while trying in: 1
all oh i: 1

either from behind: 1
then sighed i'll: 1
sounded different like: 1
watching from outside: 1

his will and: 1
floor slowly like: 1
to hand please: 1
a small touch: 1
of bellatrix's invisible: 1
there was time: 1
unheard they were: 1
moved so fast: 1
wand downward harry: 1
after her third: 1

of sunlight the: 1
caring ugly said: 1
where the hopeless: 1
essential art of: 1

i understand said: 1
dear bella harry: 1
and played poker: 1
that harry didn't: 1
not have seen: 1
any sort of: 1

so bahry only: 1
harry pointed his: 1
flux and pressure: 1
confused disarrayed his: 1
of the defense: 1
to watch the: 1

that allowed such: 1
to reject reality: 1
calm of an: 1
shield in the: 1
cell to increase: 1

fool said the: 1
still wavered on: 1
had stopped walking: 1
- someday bellatrix's: 1
hopeless feelings were: 1
like a child's: 1
whole second maybe: 1
like his brain: 1
the headache already: 1
to propose it: 1

bills and if: 1
whirlwind of razors: 1
this kind of: 1
to the next: 1
you and then: 1
that bearded face: 1
to kill a: 1

of blocking it: 1
harry's voice without: 1

of the boy-who-lived: 1
and flicking them: 1
it could hardly: 1

but things were: 1
one knee and: 1
whole lot of: 1
might still be: 1
enough to recognize: 1
boy-who-lived and the: 1
you failed to: 1

real fight -: 1
the professional intimidation: 1

took too long: 1
he smiled dryly: 1
wringing him like: 1

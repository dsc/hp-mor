was trying to: 4
that he was: 4
methods of rationality: 4
the conspiracy was: 4
he was trying: 3
trying to be: 3
that it had: 3
harry had said: 3
who did it: 3
that was when: 3
the methods of: 3
if you were: 3
on his side: 3
and it would: 3
professor flitwick that: 3
on his face: 3
to be a: 2
worked they'd gone: 2
i'll try to: 2
some of the: 2
the great hall: 2
harry shook his: 2
raised by muggles: 2
aren't trained in: 2
between luit and: 2
to have to: 2
should have been: 2
in the tribe: 2
that the problem: 2
thought came to: 2
in real life: 2
business and that: 2
and explain that: 2
clear that he: 2
but it was: 2
better off knowing: 2
the dungeons draco: 2
as a scientist: 2
in his throat: 2
pointed out that: 2
did to me: 2
words to describe: 2
thought the conspiracy: 2
and then draco: 2
not to do: 2
would be a: 2
so i was: 2
he would have: 2
pretending to be: 2
draco realized that: 2
for draco to: 2
it would be: 2
and father would: 2
thinking crazy ideas: 2
around thinking crazy: 2
said harry potter: 2
harry potter would: 2
believed the conspiracy: 2
a death eater: 2
it because you: 2
that no one: 2
a malfoy you: 2
to be friends: 2
it was a: 2
set of footsteps: 2
you did to: 2
by the time: 2
understood how evolution: 2
you aren't trained: 2
evolution worked they'd: 2
why did you: 2
and father had: 2
going to have: 2
no one would: 2
and become the: 2
and still be: 2
knowing the truth: 2
become the new: 2
of thing didn't: 2
harry said his: 2
to purify the: 2
awakened as a: 2
quite understood how: 2
be friends with: 2
runaway evolutionary process: 2
luit and yeroen: 2
that but it: 2
off knowing the: 2
a natural guess: 2
said draco his: 2
for harry's own: 2
crazy ideas like: 2
told professor flitwick: 2
harry had been: 2
said his voice: 2
gone around thinking: 2
been raised by: 2
of course i: 2
what you did: 2
be able to: 2
said it was: 2
sure said harry: 2
harry said and: 2
had quite understood: 2
the only one: 2
i'm not sure: 2
you're the only: 2
came to draco: 2
a plot that: 2
and draco had: 2
always better off: 2
harry's own good: 2
so draco said: 2
had been raised: 2
a note of: 2
draco thought some: 2
the problem is: 2
you were harry's: 2
and that was: 2
the sort of: 2
people had quite: 2
thing didn't happen: 2
before people had: 2
to stop him: 2
sort of thing: 2
shook his head: 2
had said that: 2
how evolution worked: 2
that sort of: 2
you could be: 2
they'd gone around: 2
deoxyribose nucleic acid: 2
and i was: 2
i was just: 2
it had been: 2
that it was: 2
incredibly clever slytherin: 2
you want to: 2
the alcove and: 2
something about the: 1
said and grinned: 1
you'll always be: 1
say something about: 1
together his thoughts: 1
draco then something: 1
already on him: 1
through at first: 1
then we would: 1
pressure it took: 1
a terrifying fate: 1
once though i: 1
put them into: 1
this dumbledoring belonged: 1
there's just no: 1
it hurt and: 1
some sort of: 1
it did i: 1
won't said harry: 1
science to purify: 1
it you're awakened: 1
power after they're: 1
to them that: 1
then seize power: 1
bad time but: 1
the truth about: 1
would try to: 1
when draco realized: 1
think of what: 1
equal the problem: 1
had managed to: 1
to harry potter: 1
would not be: 1
the help of: 1
you did some: 1
been a death: 1
we're equals otherwise: 1
your step draco: 1
did it because: 1
it's way too: 1
never heard the: 1
it now dumbledore: 1
have asked -: 1
plots would be: 1
to last out: 1
just didn't get: 1
named luit had: 1
the hand dangled: 1
dumbledore not to: 1
classes start tomorrow: 1
could go to: 1
fake being speechless: 1
and lawliet when: 1
been in harry's: 1
even find words: 1
way he'd been: 1
them properly after: 1
and lean act: 1
wanted to fool: 1
send back the: 1
but ask so: 1
for a more: 1
forgive you a: 1
later if draco: 1
i planned it: 1
when he grew: 1
plot this is: 1
to find the: 1
pretend to be: 1
emphasizing how kindly: 1
the play had: 1
that one coming: 1
his voice was: 1
harry potter father: 1
enemy an expensive: 1
had gently pointed: 1
vault - what: 1
or not dumbledore: 1
yes you did: 1
now that harry: 1
of us about: 1
term depth of: 1
potter would say: 1
i knew i'd: 1
but harry potter: 1
which harry said: 1
was yours and: 1
he'd been a: 1
else did madam: 1
would make sense: 1
coming to his: 1
had a pretty: 1
flitwick look very: 1
to provide the: 1
brick wall and: 1
whole year draco: 1
the title afterward: 1
the plan it's: 1
'cause y'know a: 1
had finished by: 1
what whispered draco: 1
breakfast because he: 1
also clear that: 1
and yeroen and: 1
go to gryffindor: 1
you got angry: 1
provide the sort: 1
harry's mind -: 1
will we be: 1
valuable as father: 1
recruits into the: 1
the strongest purebloods: 1
have taken some: 1
be ahead of: 1
went off and: 1
would die that: 1
has who would: 1
we could invent: 1
like human intelligence: 1
- your hand: 1
plan it's clever: 1
into a brick: 1
eyes grew intent: 1
dare enter the: 1
i promised professor: 1
harry raised his: 1
beliefs those ominous: 1
not think pressing: 1
of three which: 1
gone to see: 1
otherwise and had: 1
with dumbledore indeed: 1
a relief and: 1
that the word: 1
put on quite: 1
gone because he: 1
unrealistic because if: 1
environment stepped up: 1
can you tell: 1
without thinking about: 1
of just writing: 1
and thought you: 1
order to solve: 1
boy-who-lived could so: 1
and beside draco: 1
them to blow: 1
malfoy you would: 1
do with harry: 1
harry potter i: 1
wall and splattered: 1
draco about the: 1
more than three: 1
hadn't guessed who: 1
tragedy of light: 1
and who'd been: 1
to loan it: 1
if lucius comes: 1
that wouldn't stop: 1
kindly he'd been: 1
near the great: 1
into dumbledore's hands: 1
feel awkward if: 1
more children in: 1
steering by myself: 1
draco to last: 1
acid and you: 1
by saying that: 1
grinned and i: 1
risked using legilimency: 1
other or we: 1
me thrown out: 1
trained in any: 1
harry's eyes should: 1
- and with: 1
part of the: 1
process something that: 1
game he was: 1
than the older: 1
true draco would: 1
only relative fitness: 1
weird and dangerous: 1
to break it: 1
stupid but his: 1
for rita skeeter: 1
they weren't the: 1
hands of his: 1
been speaking archaic: 1
but his blue-trimmed: 1
draco waited in: 1
case harry potter: 1
a question sure: 1
mind scrabbled for: 1
been informed and: 1
for him father: 1
and draco realized: 1
dumbledoring belonged -: 1
distracting them whenever: 1
done to him: 1
destroy their life: 1
against granger had: 1
left arm as: 1
and tanks and: 1
a long pause: 1
and the headmaster: 1
indeed a secret: 1
did the steering: 1
about foolish gargoyles: 1
to think we're: 1
supposed to happen: 1
fate indeed to: 1
truth and can: 1
time would help: 1
the same idea: 1
idea and not: 1
purpose instead of: 1
a deadly threat: 1
problems but human: 1
it and now: 1
happen would never: 1
a scientist now: 1
i'd be able: 1
millions of years: 1
because he had: 1
the silence stretched: 1
came into sight: 1
like a cutting: 1
you wanted to: 1
without limits and: 1
to promote a: 1
a whisper please: 1
father had gently: 1
draco listened with: 1
know that i've: 1
again draco it: 1
was to teach: 1
even know that: 1
a single instant: 1
money father had: 1
to steal from: 1
go like the: 1
wasn't his fault: 1
back the flayed: 1
want to draco: 1
too many people: 1
that was exactly: 1
beings had four: 1
made in the: 1
- harry turned: 1
rules now you: 1
capacity 'cause y'know: 1
no other options: 1
anything draco's mind: 1
said draco and: 1
forced me into: 1
hostage though since: 1
yesterday wasn't the: 1
was there to: 1
some even larger: 1
but in evolutionary: 1
be extra sure: 1
is stronger wizards: 1
was already on: 1
to suppress a: 1
interrupt at that: 1
said draco's mouth: 1
was as complicated: 1
was mine dumbledore: 1
but imagine say: 1
draco was a: 1
perfect draco would: 1
did that the: 1
problem is that: 1
would have me: 1
and father's eye: 1
turned his head: 1
single day harry: 1
snape used as: 1
the rule of: 1
for threatening draco: 1
that twisty that: 1
just couldn't get: 1
his reasoning would: 1
lit up i'm: 1
smart maybe even: 1
you helped push: 1
instead of just: 1
next saturday it: 1
draco i'm afraid: 1
the difficulty of: 1
knew and draco: 1
was gone because: 1
my hand had: 1
have risked using: 1
the authorities when: 1
having fewer children: 1
draco nodded no: 1
it but imagine: 1
and now you're: 1
dead madam pomfrey: 1
else slowly draco's: 1
shone on him: 1
high-pitched voice at: 1
year draco would: 1
of them to: 1
that wasn't supposed: 1
of the methods: 1
the headmaster interrupted: 1
didn't do it: 1
permanent harry said: 1
it perfect draco: 1
and you'd be: 1
it implied unless: 1
to study for: 1
alcove and started: 1
the churning in: 1
than anyone who: 1
for months but: 1
as he'd woken: 1
purify the wizarding: 1
in an instant: 1
indeed to be: 1
probably maybe well: 1
i've been thinking: 1
cunning as light: 1
that made it: 1
no good reason: 1
if draco changed: 1
in the middle: 1
the playwright would: 1
like the climate: 1
that we could: 1
more children than: 1
and ally like: 1
mouth shut if: 1
relative fitness advantages: 1
at harry potter: 1
tell me which: 1
fight to the: 1
and then the: 1
draco i was: 1
i make over: 1
so draco would: 1
whispered draco of: 1
sure - the: 1
be someone's friend: 1
why this was: 1
trained in the: 1
had once read: 1
to me what: 1
it was harry: 1
limit - had: 1
believe it or: 1
draco could just: 1
working it was: 1
to be extra: 1
after that for: 1
his blue-trimmed robes: 1
harry said the: 1
harry laughed draco: 1
been put on: 1
access - i'll: 1
said harry what: 1
expensive present draco: 1
no by the: 1
into feeding the: 1
acting toward draco: 1
draco did not: 1
his plan was: 1
second most powerful: 1
to fool harry: 1
plan well harry: 1
into by trying: 1
did it was: 1
say who did: 1
them ever but: 1
was slowly dawning: 1
harry potter before: 1
yours and so: 1
disappointed harry's voice: 1
that it actually: 1
revenge someday maybe: 1
of human intelligence: 1
and nuclear weapons: 1
father and explain: 1
in father's silly: 1
the term depth: 1
harry's friend harry: 1
i did that: 1
started heading toward: 1
draco that harry: 1
couldn't just threaten: 1
it had felt: 1
some more bad: 1
could be trying: 1
was the only: 1
cheerfully it's nothing: 1
want lucius malfoy's: 1
it would spread: 1
if you know: 1
sudden twitch of: 1
foiled and the: 1
smile as he: 1
time classes start: 1
draco forced out: 1
one coming and: 1
of harry's plot: 1
you could maneuver: 1
up furthering the: 1
and started shrieking: 1
if you didn't: 1
could forgive you: 1
golden ink a: 1
that harry actually: 1
plan but it: 1
when professor flitwick: 1
if you never: 1
take over the: 1
had not intervened: 1
neutral but his: 1
steal from my: 1
family's interests just: 1
in any of: 1
that was as: 1
find the truth: 1
frequency of a: 1
managed to steal: 1
thought that you'd: 1
parts especially in: 1
with nikkie as: 1
clever slytherin a: 1
possible the real: 1
things like people: 1
some lonely mutation: 1
on draco what: 1
have much of: 1
and today's scientists: 1
and i explained: 1
happened yesterday wasn't: 1
evolutionary arms race: 1
only been a: 1
of playing dumbledore: 1
or even slow: 1
using an ancient: 1
were clever and: 1
of condescension and: 1
said vincent's voice: 1
to me it: 1
name father had: 1
been for harry's: 1
father's silly bedtime: 1
you can't possibly: 1
the green grounds: 1
started shrieking in: 1
those but they're: 1
understood why they: 1
take all of: 1
to thwart it: 1
coming and beside: 1
would cost cost: 1
angry you did: 1
the power of: 1
the plot to: 1
us to find: 1
laughed draco didn't: 1
the project draco: 1
you've only been: 1
draco said coldly: 1
j k rowling: 1
said harry this: 1
as cunning as: 1
potter there and: 1
intelligence in the: 1
extremely serious business: 1
respect your expertise: 1
a few more: 1
rose up in: 1
migrate and people: 1
boy-who-lived i was: 1
get angry at: 1
kill harry harry: 1
evil using an: 1
said finally but: 1
himself but it: 1
as if they: 1
then draco realized: 1
most of the: 1
in his voice: 1
might start a: 1
to be pretending: 1
to do was: 1
succeeding i'm sorry: 1
now you're mine: 1
flitwick spun around: 1
i expect she'll: 1
that wasn't going: 1
just as harry: 1
came closer the: 1
children than everyone: 1
you couldn't just: 1
a little smarter: 1
to happen would: 1
it wasn't and: 1
eyes should have: 1
would be in: 1
of us to: 1
the brain size: 1
wanted that much: 1
of the work: 1
gene in the: 1
of course but: 1
way so that: 1
today so ya'd: 1
footsteps came closer: 1
draco of how: 1
have all that: 1
thought some very: 1
time they tried: 1
a sudden twitch: 1
was now effectively: 1
work in real: 1
had been hugely: 1
the gold i: 1
draco had started: 1
not be small: 1
harry's best interests: 1
of surprised pleasure: 1
truth about blood: 1
spread to other: 1
right now did: 1
with you in: 1
draco harry walked: 1
dumbledore brought harry: 1
just stared at: 1
respect my expertise: 1
quite succeeding i'm: 1
asked all of: 1
he'd found near: 1
doing - addressing: 1
along with that: 1
torture hex and: 1
it yesterday i: 1
knew what was: 1
fool would attempt: 1
reflex harry looked: 1
and with a: 1
now da boss: 1
not how much: 1
to make certain: 1
what a terribly: 1
going much too: 1
as he explained: 1
the conspiracy you've: 1
- and mcgonagall: 1
stop that no: 1
of the conspiracy: 1
said and now: 1
to his aid: 1
thinking about the: 1
was just the: 1
a confrontation developed: 1
in his best: 1
happen because the: 1
authorities when a: 1
and gasping in: 1
as soon as: 1
pretty good guess: 1
i'm glad to: 1
wizard draco simply: 1
heir and believe: 1
ask you for: 1
didn't get it: 1
invent a tool: 1
dumbledore's mysterious secret: 1
loan you the: 1
you and put: 1
was just about: 1
a small windowed: 1
draco didn't have: 1
did said harry: 1
to do that: 1
rationality and then: 1
hadn't been that: 1
and strikes unseen: 1
for advice about: 1
but it would: 1
in that alcove: 1
writing plays about: 1
anyone whose name: 1
just in case: 1
power of science: 1
take some money: 1
what harry would: 1
that his target: 1
rationality the deeper: 1
bad words to: 1
with their guns: 1
the cost to: 1
foil this one: 1
and yeroen but: 1
all the spending: 1
compared them to: 1
hugely disappointed and: 1
right would prevail: 1
draco had awakened: 1
went to madam: 1
was right there: 1
couldn't possibly be: 1
gerbil one set: 1
tried to gentle: 1
you tell me: 1
see a play: 1
draco said without: 1
which plot this: 1
real life father: 1
it hadn't taken: 1
where all this: 1
how much he'd: 1
strange thought came: 1
read a famous: 1
harry's eyes grew: 1
of rationality draco: 1
who had accidentally: 1
the headmaster's usual: 1
human would have: 1
with a smile: 1
with just a: 1
it meant that: 1
k rowling coils: 1
you already worked: 1
him to tell: 1
voices would both: 1
of the game: 1
neutral harry shook: 1
say said draco: 1
for that harry: 1
you those but: 1
orca circles hard: 1
lose that vote: 1
that harry should: 1
it harry's eyes: 1
just about to: 1
had tried to: 1
blood and whatever: 1
them no other: 1
would attempt a: 1
were trying to: 1
dumbledore believed the: 1
despair that although: 1
there in the: 1
same idea i: 1
again he was: 1
da boss ain't: 1
dumbledore and father: 1
but of course: 1
for one day: 1
lot harder to: 1
harry said quietly: 1
of runaway evolutionary: 1
draco you're the: 1
older slytherins he'd: 1
because you got: 1
taken very long: 1
the only friend: 1
expensive pouch to: 1
chat and harry: 1
did i would: 1
deadly threat it: 1
indeed said harry: 1
small windowed alcove: 1
it he might: 1
himself hadn't been: 1
take two weeks: 1
light who'd set: 1
tool and you: 1
be looking for: 1
who knows the: 1
problems a little: 1
always unrealistic because: 1
own good if: 1
his mouth hanging: 1
certain no one: 1
to being enemies: 1
scientist now harry: 1
as a relief: 1
that being his: 1
of a young: 1
make over the: 1
now effectively a: 1
in a single: 1
now you couldn't: 1
madam pomfrey say: 1
effort because you're: 1
only one path: 1
before the wizengamot: 1
one who knows: 1
it would only: 1
the voice should: 1
was having trouble: 1
to hurt you: 1
friend lucius has: 1
but i was: 1
i had to: 1
dark torture hex: 1
just taken for: 1
them draco couldn't: 1
death eater harry: 1
tell light his: 1
didn't understand what: 1
form an alliance: 1
that idiot alive: 1
about it at: 1
energy went into: 1
it's nothing that: 1
running through draco's: 1
knew we'd been: 1
then draco didn't: 1
clever draco said: 1
well harry said: 1
unworkability of harry's: 1
was doomed to: 1
draco couldn't help: 1
left the alcove: 1
wondering if you: 1
under veritaserum that: 1
stomach churning there: 1
complicated as possible: 1
us out but: 1
steering the conspiracy: 1
i just wanted: 1
like this were: 1
windowed alcove he'd: 1
said draco i'm: 1
to hate them: 1
taken for granted: 1
end i just: 1
seeming stuck in: 1
conspiracy you've only: 1
and ten times: 1
it was clear: 1
from wasting the: 1
brain humans were: 1
the tribe from: 1
eyes lit up: 1
they both helped: 1
wrong and pointed: 1
slytherins he'd chewed: 1
draco couldn't quite: 1
and afterward he: 1
was test it: 1
reason why this: 1
need to respect: 1
people stuff but: 1
play had ended: 1
and came up: 1
species that sort: 1
draco realized with: 1
tell harry that: 1
a little chat: 1
the relative frequency: 1
to say no: 1
hate them properly: 1
was a very: 1
would help me: 1
the person who: 1
secret the one: 1
understand said draco: 1
the plan was: 1
nucleic acid and: 1
study for months: 1
harry now had: 1
many different avenues: 1
better tools the: 1
harry walked over: 1
just so you: 1
had confronted the: 1
- i'll loan: 1
i harry said: 1
with a note: 1
threatening draco that: 1
the real limit: 1
no problem then: 1
would try together: 1
they had gone: 1
at once though: 1
almost all the: 1
have more children: 1
there would be: 1
have gotten away: 1
and send back: 1
once read a: 1
up most of: 1
though stating the: 1
more bad words: 1
draco saw the: 1
won't even call: 1
very stern and: 1
in the first: 1
nikkie had not: 1
with two paths: 1
about yesterday and: 1
what the word: 1
ink a giant: 1
humans were ridiculously: 1
cast on my: 1
walked into dumbledore's: 1
descendants a hundred: 1
so they both: 1
mind completely and: 1
have made it: 1
be so likable: 1
betrayal into his: 1
got into them: 1
so professor flitwick: 1
was that any: 1
silly bedtime stories: 1
a tool and: 1
father had asked: 1
you'd be ahead: 1
evil plots would: 1
not suspect you: 1
that he did: 1
try together to: 1
had been no: 1
stories about foolish: 1
right there in: 1
of accusation in: 1
human's metabolic energy: 1
for as long: 1
would wield the: 1
you're ignorant of: 1
draco would learn: 1
said harry a: 1
you appreciate what: 1
die that made: 1
wanted draco to: 1
make certain no: 1
madness there had: 1
had learned about: 1
politics the book: 1
what he'd done: 1
alcove he'd found: 1
to underestimate a: 1
potter needed another: 1
voice wasn't hard: 1
him so we: 1
aback but in: 1
of horror and: 1
first i won't: 1
this was and: 1
cleverly concealed his: 1
bedtime stories about: 1
thought that i'd: 1
then the play: 1
been smart maybe: 1
good guess at: 1
him draco didn't: 1
changed his mind: 1
he just stared: 1
muggles it wasn't: 1
kill harry potter: 1
to be grateful: 1
plot which required: 1
had started pulling: 1
i did to: 1
slytherin a villain: 1
to demolish almost: 1
playing dumbledore and: 1
the way harry: 1
his voice wasn't: 1
get it right: 1
didn't i harry: 1
this is a: 1
a cutting charm: 1
raised his left: 1
on him on: 1
a limit the: 1
good if harry: 1
woken up and: 1
potter just to: 1
for granted that: 1
you didn't do: 1
his voice neutral: 1
boy-who-lived testify under: 1
apologized deeply which: 1
any small requests: 1
to be his: 1
of harry's dreams: 1
dangled limply from: 1
the money was: 1
children in fact: 1
climate changed and: 1
out his plan: 1
- harry was: 1
too far and: 1
yes harry's eyes: 1
in the title: 1
malfoy did something: 1
someone you planned: 1
started lecturing me: 1
belong to him: 1
a friendly way: 1
have been too: 1
be stupid but: 1
absolute fool he'd: 1
see it now: 1
surprised pleasure draco: 1
universal and everyone: 1
his side dumbledore: 1
i could forgive: 1
said that wasn't: 1
scientist than anyone: 1
mood in an: 1
if he'd been: 1
slytherin named light: 1
to happen again: 1
the deeper secret: 1
potter harry had: 1
life and leave: 1
to make draco: 1
- don't worry: 1
being his enemy: 1
wouldn't even be: 1
of hominids trying: 1
learn to use: 1
insane instead harry: 1
couldn't have gotten: 1
had further explained: 1
voice at both: 1
have words to: 1
that as soon: 1
people stuff harry: 1
imagine say lucius: 1
something harry had: 1
interests just me: 1
predict the real: 1
so that you: 1
distracted by that: 1
want to be: 1
note of horror: 1
key or dumbledore: 1
in golden ink: 1
to go back: 1
but they're a: 1
of the plan: 1
life the silence: 1
he wasn't as: 1
up and realized: 1
he'd done you: 1
patterns and came: 1
delicate business and: 1
make draco a: 1
about how he: 1
into the small: 1
that the intelligence: 1
evolutionary origins of: 1
that way lay: 1
play while draco: 1
know enough science: 1
which was that: 1
what it meant: 1
understand what else: 1
hex and extremely: 1
gold i managed: 1
lied so yes: 1
wrapped around this: 1
we bring new: 1
and stop that: 1
now did not: 1
realized that harry: 1
madam pomfrey said: 1
so yes harry's: 1
not dumbledore thinks: 1
though to look: 1
his face was: 1
friends with him: 1
someone's friend and: 1
the intelligence was: 1
slowly draco's mind: 1
your enemy not: 1
of which he: 1
wouldn't kill harry: 1
four times the: 1
would live on: 1
advantage didn't have: 1
didn't have much: 1
to respect your: 1
how an adult: 1
give his enemy: 1
hadn't been put: 1
what we were: 1
meant that the: 1
playing it and: 1
known that as: 1
took to promote: 1
both be blurred: 1
as light would: 1
just what it: 1
had once taken: 1
good deal of: 1
crazy was that: 1
absolutely unacceptable there: 1
but draco had: 1
the statement was: 1
seen that one: 1
limits and today's: 1
cost terribly the: 1
down so draco: 1
them to chimpanzees: 1
there had been: 1
where he can: 1
how all those: 1
happen again and: 1
his little hands: 1
fork with two: 1
a lot harder: 1
hard at all: 1
evolved so that: 1
discoveries got made: 1
i can get: 1
course but it: 1
used by their: 1
for breakfast because: 1
creature rather than: 1
dumbledore to keep: 1
to father you: 1
harry looked taken: 1
able to convince: 1
do anything draco's: 1
running into another: 1
his true face: 1
hominids trying to: 1
looking around to: 1
you're awakened as: 1
to be friendly: 1
attempt a plot: 1
lower almost a: 1
means right now: 1
good and it: 1
a good deal: 1
but someday harry: 1
lucius thought the: 1
scientist for one: 1
away with that: 1
said now what: 1
of rationality i: 1
into so professor: 1
put up a: 1
prevail the perfect: 1
out that while: 1
had won and: 1
it would cost: 1
way lay madness: 1
the aging alpha: 1
at both of: 1
around this you: 1
father had then: 1
should say to: 1
draco realized you: 1
an evolutionary arms: 1
alpha with nikkie: 1
time was ripe: 1
to be as: 1
that threatens your: 1
conspiracy was mine: 1
excuse me i: 1
gargoyles who always: 1
little then the: 1
enter the great: 1
wasn't and draco: 1
ask a question: 1
at you i: 1
lean act 3: 1
who'd set out: 1
had to invent: 1
good mood today: 1
more but draco: 1
said it should: 1
depth of recursion: 1
about the project: 1
draco said still: 1
smarter than any: 1
politely telling dumbledore: 1
accept that he'll: 1
- addressing the: 1
rushed things always: 1
about blood and: 1
outward toward the: 1
and said what: 1
it and father's: 1
tried to do: 1
single instant the: 1
obvious and it: 1
power you'll always: 1
to do with: 1
of rationality the: 1
his head at: 1
grow up and: 1
trying to suppress: 1
and push without: 1
since draco had: 1
them you helped: 1
nikkie to form: 1
extra sure i've: 1
something that would: 1
gasped no flitwick: 1
money said draco's: 1
was nearby their: 1
play right into: 1
did me a: 1
a bit distracted: 1
put a note: 1
that and neither: 1
front because i: 1
do even if: 1
refusing to say: 1
from showing on: 1
long after that: 1
harry could have: 1
they might even: 1
their voices would: 1
planned what you: 1
draco's mind ran: 1
arm as though: 1
him for that: 1
the shock from: 1
that i'd already: 1
to himself -: 1
of some even: 1
likable that it: 1
really made you: 1
harry still dipped: 1
than everyone else: 1
draco said now: 1
take one of: 1
the problem on: 1
news came as: 1
had to do: 1
chewed out he'd: 1
else harry could: 1
hand had been: 1
all stern concealing: 1
to launch a: 1
with the same: 1
way of increased: 1
see this play: 1
yeroen overthrow luit: 1
every time they: 1
in evolutionary terms: 1
this one harry: 1
sounding disappointed harry's: 1
instant the news: 1
the tragedy of: 1
just to be: 1
did some of: 1
face there had: 1
a giant chocolate: 1
them into your: 1
master plan but: 1
knowledge behind how: 1
drive some lonely: 1
kept talking about: 1
all of harry: 1
made it a: 1
trying to outwit: 1
to give his: 1
a price and: 1
blue-trimmed robes looked: 1
named light who'd: 1
meant to underestimate: 1
effectively a magical: 1
it's clever draco: 1
have any mentors: 1
i'm sorry draco: 1
one day you: 1
even call it: 1
plots it implied: 1
tried to stop: 1
push and push: 1
lucius malfoy's eye: 1
requests i make: 1
weeks to eat: 1
in ravenclaw house: 1
the end i: 1
while draco listened: 1
in order to: 1
the thought came: 1
like deoxyribose nucleic: 1
friend harry now: 1
test your beliefs: 1
toward the green: 1
yeroen but had: 1
putting pain and: 1
so the first: 1
organisms would just: 1
wasn't going to: 1
and i'm not: 1
wasn't ever to: 1
wasn't so draco: 1
is our world: 1
advice about something: 1
draco of course: 1
you the way: 1
caught i guess: 1
taken aback but: 1
conspiracy was your: 1
threw up his: 1
to draco that: 1
to conceal his: 1
could kill anyone: 1
that would push: 1
both exhausted draco: 1
would have tried: 1
the older slytherins: 1
harry what a: 1
headmaster's office draco: 1
of right would: 1
been associating the: 1
him just as: 1
describe exactly what: 1
angry at you: 1
called chimpanzee politics: 1
eye on them: 1
remember harry knew: 1
thinking about it: 1
isn't that you're: 1
in years but: 1
through draco's mind: 1
do draco lied: 1
the conspiracy they're: 1
horror and despair: 1
trouble hating harry: 1
now his voice: 1
of mistake you: 1
hard for draco: 1
to chimpanzees that: 1
hufflepuff trying to: 1
very long after: 1
each other -: 1
they're both exhausted: 1
someday harry potter: 1
it really made: 1
of a gene: 1
furthering the hero's: 1
you would comprehend: 1
which draco would: 1
voice caught i: 1
at this time: 1
with only one: 1
dawning on draco: 1
different avenues for: 1
what i did: 1
it was slowly: 1
and put them: 1
harry might even: 1
make if you: 1
hurt to be: 1
draco to thwart: 1
i was the: 1
absolutely true draco: 1
the perfect revenge: 1
as complicated as: 1
the first step: 1
you can forgive: 1
luit and become: 1
and father for: 1
population and drive: 1
only in father's: 1
you a second: 1
had kept running: 1
had already been: 1
delicate matter of: 1
right away right: 1
draco would be: 1
the worst possible: 1
won and become: 1
a scientist in: 1
a villain named: 1
by that last: 1
named nikkie nikkie: 1
by muggles to: 1
brilliant make your: 1
his aid distracting: 1
it actually was: 1
safer if i: 1
than a wizard: 1
or he would: 1
intent buying that: 1
right parts especially: 1
soon as he'd: 1
couldn't quite keep: 1
it like something: 1
the conspiracy probably: 1
into his voice: 1
buy granger an: 1
that while lawliet: 1
weapons and compared: 1
did madam pomfrey: 1
were right that's: 1
word bayesian in: 1
to describe exactly: 1
that the person: 1
and harry politely: 1
have to think: 1
was exactly what: 1
plan of playing: 1
at his heart: 1
his eyes growing: 1
anyone else in: 1
on just so: 1
really he ought: 1
boss ain't in: 1
and realized that: 1
indeed extremely serious: 1
the work but: 1
that as the: 1
of light about: 1
call it fair: 1
was indeed extremely: 1
me or anyone: 1
alpha yeroen with: 1
always be looking: 1
it took to: 1
unworkable it might: 1
a famous book: 1
good reason for: 1
that you aren't: 1
his chest he: 1
at all the: 1
only take one: 1
help of a: 1
it and it: 1
as though to: 1
i know this: 1
only friend lucius: 1
do the playwright: 1
try to respect: 1
asked - excuse: 1
over the world: 1
but the boy-who-lived: 1
discover the truth: 1
the next couple: 1
go i see: 1
thought of that: 1
be dumb enough: 1
gasps of agony: 1
hard to see: 1
was making it: 1
with the help: 1
scientific progress but: 1
he explained to: 1
last one -: 1
looked taken aback: 1
am a malfoy: 1
human beings had: 1
he'd been not: 1
that could kill: 1
had tortured him: 1
potter's methods of: 1
slowly shouting brilliant: 1
a special congratulatory: 1
to foil this: 1
mine - harry: 1
sort of consistent: 1
ain't in a: 1
at that the: 1
harry can i: 1
had the boy-who-lived: 1
an adult chimpanzee: 1
but then draco: 1
if it did: 1
had to interrupt: 1
matter of which: 1
comes up with: 1
now draco you're: 1
completely and said: 1
almost a whisper: 1
his mouth shut: 1
carefully keeping his: 1
do as part: 1
he didn't care: 1
tomorrow for a: 1
people had to: 1
that the whole: 1
options not both: 1
in the lone: 1
what else did: 1
if dumbledore brought: 1
late to say: 1
warned draco against: 1
was a concession: 1
used up most: 1
sadly and draco: 1
pain and betrayal: 1
was universal and: 1
mind i guess: 1
true face and: 1
his face thinking: 1
this was indeed: 1
fool harry potter: 1
trying to foil: 1
you were trying: 1
flitwick said that: 1
a favor harry: 1
chimpanzee 20 of: 1
his hold draco: 1
stuck in his: 1
who could ruin: 1
and had learned: 1
and it killed: 1
had a little: 1
because what i: 1
if i got: 1
plays about it: 1
would play right: 1
new recruits into: 1
a second time: 1
flitwick threw up: 1
actually was trying: 1
draco he said: 1
a very valuable: 1
brightness shone on: 1
what was good: 1
his enemy would: 1
headmaster's usual plotting: 1
i see said: 1
in fact if: 1
things to happen: 1
to ask you: 1
and believe it: 1
mood today so: 1
said that the: 1
slack like a: 1
the two students: 1
even worse probably: 1
you wanted that: 1
up father had: 1
given draco to: 1
of consistent selection: 1
next couple of: 1
just tell him: 1
out but only: 1
throat professor flitwick: 1
thought some more: 1
that the spell: 1
and turned his: 1
tool and i: 1
be doing -: 1
named lawliet who'd: 1
loan it to: 1
actually okay draco: 1
otherwise it would: 1
comes to steering: 1
battles with each: 1
that harry potter: 1
he might see: 1
before you go: 1
serious secret delicate: 1
see harry potter: 1
beginning before people: 1
as the second: 1
tried to carry: 1
but only in: 1
all been for: 1
potter's evil plots: 1
the money said: 1
what happened yesterday: 1
as valuable as: 1
long pause and: 1
you and lucius: 1
much too far: 1
a malfoy did: 1
all of them: 1
- then draco: 1
solve all the: 1
might be hard: 1
right now sure: 1
i understand what: 1
draco's mind if: 1
the flayed body: 1
draco said slowly: 1
from my gringotts: 1
into position just: 1
an instant why: 1
away from him: 1
be pretending to: 1
in a good: 1
instant why didn't: 1
course i did: 1
hand draco said: 1
plan was unworkable: 1
in draco's stomach: 1
a malfoy draco: 1
harry harry had: 1
go along with: 1
made you appreciate: 1
happen after that: 1
carry out his: 1
on them ever: 1
know said draco: 1
written in golden: 1
why didn't i: 1
title afterward father: 1
had kept talking: 1
was where all: 1
sort of runaway: 1
potter had been: 1
'tragedy' was right: 1
only in ways: 1
was we would: 1
insane and that: 1
said in a: 1
going to stop: 1
potter as though: 1
light and lawliet: 1
be sure -: 1
would tell harry: 1
selection pressure it: 1
harry's dreams away: 1
had four times: 1
draco had tried: 1
the headmaster forced: 1
brain must have: 1
little hufflepuff trying: 1
it or not: 1
had asked draco: 1
evolutionary process something: 1
were always unrealistic: 1
night knowing harry: 1
for them to: 1
second time i'm: 1
of footsteps came: 1
afterward he would: 1
was safer if: 1
be thrown out: 1
ya go said: 1
the way of: 1
madam pomfrey whispered: 1
its problems a: 1
you were clever: 1
potter could be: 1
much of a: 1
have me thrown: 1
terribly serious matter: 1
harry's move against: 1
but it could: 1
of that but: 1
had cleverly concealed: 1
that point and: 1
draco and he: 1
him too many: 1
sunlight shining into: 1
in the methods: 1
evil draco nodded: 1
dungeons draco had: 1
of plots it: 1
he was just: 1
note written in: 1
was when father: 1
but in a: 1
hogwarts the brightness: 1
recursion - but: 1
father had once: 1
get a little: 1
increased mental capacity: 1
muggles to do: 1
and fight their: 1
worst possible scenario: 1
to describe the: 1
memory rose up: 1
draco if he: 1
said that as: 1
he said softly: 1
would have been: 1
finish between them: 1
interrupted him and: 1
that vote father: 1
about something actually: 1
did people stuff: 1
walked along suppressing: 1
teach you why: 1
a place so: 1
you he knew: 1
too much isn't: 1
- excuse me: 1
me and the: 1
expect she'll also: 1
could ruin you: 1
had said seizing: 1
but with only: 1
immediately that it: 1
smile on his: 1
been a scientist: 1
maybe in years: 1
what do you: 1
mind wrapped around: 1
said coldly like: 1
it was universal: 1
and said that: 1
the first place: 1
a smile on: 1
he knew we'd: 1
too and there's: 1
who wasn't so: 1
hands and started: 1
draco changed his: 1
without the methods: 1
it down so: 1
was screaming draco: 1
that draco couldn't: 1
was your plan: 1
had said it: 1
up his little: 1
his enemy an: 1
draco to do: 1
that only one: 1
nikkie as the: 1
was carefully neutral: 1
about his revenge: 1
speaking archaic greek: 1
about deoxyribose nucleic: 1
draco was going: 1
voice was lower: 1
light would actually: 1
had been for: 1
explain that the: 1
in the alien: 1
a magical creature: 1
easy to go: 1
father had given: 1
could be my: 1
he was already: 1
the boy-who-lived could: 1
to - how: 1
truth draco said: 1
this was crazy: 1
by asking them: 1
what that runaway: 1
draco would take: 1
say to make: 1
about the headmaster's: 1
sunbeam draco in: 1
up with that: 1
later that was: 1
he can make: 1
like that and: 1
going to skin: 1
advantages could increase: 1
wizengamot willingly or: 1
didn't want to: 1
that for nikkie: 1
been trying to: 1
harry said it: 1
saw the question: 1
draco had been: 1
toward draco what: 1
that the money: 1
splattered he just: 1
hadn't taken very: 1
above no no: 1
if harry tried: 1
been thinking when: 1
to test your: 1
would happen again: 1
so strange that: 1
were harry's enemy: 1
had felt last: 1
learn think of: 1
helped push i: 1
happen in real: 1
wouldn't have thought: 1
was for harry's: 1
alive and send: 1
only one in: 1
months but of: 1
at all harry: 1
evolutionary process had: 1
to say who: 1
loyal servant now: 1
or dumbledore does: 1
because you're the: 1
him a special: 1
directly in the: 1
enemies later he: 1
money so i: 1
be absolutely true: 1
disappointed and father: 1
to happen for: 1
person who invented: 1
life only in: 1
harry will we: 1
do that but: 1
you're going to: 1
and i had: 1
live on just: 1
one path easy: 1
said cheerfully it's: 1
a scientist harry: 1
mutation to the: 1
plays like this: 1
nearby their voices: 1
had to be: 1
potter father could: 1
know this is: 1
even be stupid: 1
stepped up the: 1
be my equal: 1
might not have: 1
left with just: 1
about to launch: 1
along suppressing his: 1
that any plot: 1
one wouldn't notice: 1
whenever a confrontation: 1
that's just what: 1
that he didn't: 1
sort of mistake: 1
harry's friend then: 1
pleased way draco: 1
a play called: 1
anything the headmaster: 1
inventions just weren't: 1
smarter in order: 1
twitch of surprised: 1
we could do: 1
to gentle itself: 1
and face he: 1
a chimpanzee 20: 1
deduced immediately that: 1
and started lecturing: 1
though it hadn't: 1
just no way: 1
had told him: 1
watching plays so: 1
he would kill: 1
didn't have all: 1
from coming to: 1
can i ask: 1
powerful though it: 1
him there was: 1
had shouted and: 1
you understood it: 1
stop him and: 1
so ya'd better: 1
seizing control of: 1
i was in: 1
in the beginning: 1
deeper secret knowledge: 1
whose name and: 1
as harry had: 1
that the other: 1
good really he: 1
condescension and not: 1
the questions i: 1
guess but wrong: 1
set out to: 1
we would try: 1
and tribes had: 1
rather than a: 1
draco you can't: 1
would happen after: 1
truth and then: 1
nucleic acid that: 1
two students stood: 1
interest not to: 1
asking them draco: 1
properly after which: 1
granger had been: 1
that refusing to: 1
scrabbled for patterns: 1
i was wondering: 1
told him draco: 1
mentally kicked himself: 1
threatens your family's: 1
a dead gerbil: 1
to himself but: 1
with his eyes: 1
luit had confronted: 1
and even if: 1
present draco wouldn't: 1
my equal when: 1
silence stretched i: 1
was when draco: 1
never work in: 1
and the other: 1
another loan it's: 1
random any more: 1
me which plot: 1
special congratulatory note: 1
flayed body with: 1
harry this is: 1
conspiracy and the: 1
the playwright had: 1
human intelligence in: 1
y'know a human: 1
ignorant of specific: 1
dumbledore thought that: 1
friend and ally: 1
people like this: 1
secret knowledge behind: 1
side where he: 1
that in the: 1
i apologized deeply: 1
metabolic energy went: 1
voice you didn't: 1
had led to: 1
overthrow luit and: 1
to the headmaster's: 1
lawliet when he: 1
had ended sadly: 1
by their descendants: 1
slow it down: 1
the new new: 1
the forces of: 1
would have totally: 1
that was almost: 1
conspiracy probably wouldn't: 1
toward the dungeons: 1
draco a more: 1
harry would live: 1
you could destroy: 1
been a dark: 1
in a shaking: 1
explained to harry: 1
to be the: 1
course i planned: 1
two of us: 1
now dumbledore looking: 1
looked oddly askew: 1
a human would: 1
would have to: 1
draco to remember: 1
whispered draco dumbledore: 1
promptly hauled off: 1
said and even: 1
after that footsteps: 1
one set of: 1
but harry shook: 1
pulling together his: 1
idea i did: 1
see said draco: 1
trying and a: 1
with harry or: 1
scientist harry had: 1
anyone who wasn't: 1
you go harry: 1
thought was test: 1
and draco couldn't: 1
shadow and draco: 1
if you looked: 1
screaming draco thought: 1
it a deadly: 1
just see it: 1
body with a: 1
scientist in a: 1
than any other: 1
they're going to: 1
on to demolish: 1
as many galleons: 1
alpha it really: 1
myself and without: 1
own good really: 1
harry said i: 1
at what that: 1
word 'tragedy' was: 1
cooking up together: 1
arms race without: 1
plot was to: 1
this play draco: 1
look at it: 1
acid that wouldn't: 1
out but if: 1
to teach you: 1
draco wouldn't have: 1
than three different: 1
friend then he: 1
refuses any small: 1
accidentally hurt someone: 1
one of them: 1
get it was: 1
results the thought: 1
the time classes: 1
draco in shadow: 1
informed and that: 1
granger used up: 1
in the way: 1
harry potter came: 1
things happen right: 1
act 3 draco: 1
had known that: 1
smarter to solve: 1
knew i'd hurt: 1
no one was: 1
to discover the: 1
please don't do: 1
should be doing: 1
to be harry's: 1
that it would: 1
would actually do: 1
threat it wasn't: 1
game had rules: 1
stern and then: 1
would only take: 1
was pretending to: 1
be more wrong: 1
to the point: 1
a pleased way: 1
worse than what: 1
wasn't the plan: 1
only a fool: 1
gryffindor which was: 1
as i was: 1
as he thought: 1
be small draco: 1
was worse than: 1
though since draco: 1
you think of: 1
can put up: 1
the small beam: 1
the play while: 1
way you could: 1
be his friend: 1
and beside harry: 1
and the forces: 1
someone at random: 1
that this was: 1
i'll loan you: 1
own free will: 1
blood purism were: 1
were cooking up: 1
favor harry nodded: 1
this time would: 1
i guess i: 1
him father had: 1
used as his: 1
said harry will: 1
when a malfoy: 1
and not quite: 1
brought harry potter: 1
you do this: 1
headmaster told professor: 1
the world himself: 1
awe would have: 1
chimpanzees that the: 1
harry's eyes lit: 1
father thought the: 1
light his name: 1
legilimency just to: 1
and wider and: 1
one snape used: 1
was acting toward: 1
might be able: 1
draco was trembling: 1
that gigantic outsized: 1
to sound gentle: 1
real limit was: 1
point where it: 1
for his own: 1
got worse harry: 1
clever slytherin named: 1
didn't happen in: 1
the finish between: 1
up and fight: 1
a few galleons: 1
for granger used: 1
revenge unless just: 1
wasn't supposed to: 1
solve them ending: 1
how i can: 1
both of us: 1
bring new recruits: 1
it had all: 1
happen for months: 1
be difficult and: 1
would be even: 1
shrieking in a: 1
don't worry harry: 1
to blow the: 1
do that again: 1
except luring draco: 1
alien incomprehensible way: 1
hauled off to: 1
i don't know: 1
of me harry: 1
and extremely serious: 1
possible after what: 1
eye was already: 1
and harry potter: 1
the beginning before: 1
want to break: 1
itself even more: 1
harry said you're: 1
conspiracy was yours: 1
pay the strongest: 1
me being evil: 1
trembling now if: 1
about the evolutionary: 1
him that it: 1
would be foiled: 1
leave them no: 1
truth together is: 1
underestimate a malfoy: 1
mouth hanging slack: 1
voice seeming stuck: 1
should be emphasizing: 1
when it comes: 1
you would make: 1
he was insane: 1
he could always: 1
blurred of course: 1
i'd already informed: 1
novel problems but: 1
was just insane: 1
isn't it said: 1
gentle and also: 1
rationality i understand: 1
father's eye was: 1
father you already: 1
was hard to: 1
the world of: 1
far and i: 1
that you'd turned: 1
some very bad: 1
of ravenclaw so: 1
is a bad: 1
everyone else only: 1
then something harry: 1
softly the two: 1
were on his: 1
the lone sunbeam: 1
now had so: 1
this wasn't ever: 1
he had already: 1
just wanted the: 1
to happen by: 1
a bad time: 1
idiot alive and: 1
draco's mouth in: 1
the fights between: 1
side dumbledore thought: 1
himself instead of: 1
could so the: 1
use your power: 1
eater now he: 1
mentors and thought: 1
and not anything: 1
of specific science: 1
waiting for them: 1
there was a: 1
it at this: 1
around and started: 1
you don't even: 1
to do as: 1
matured chimpanzee named: 1
stuff but you: 1
be a more: 1
teach him to: 1
it was to: 1
also feel awkward: 1
bit distracted by: 1
archaic greek for: 1
she refuses any: 1
draco's mind completely: 1
most powerful though: 1
plan harry said: 1
to other tribes: 1
not make sense: 1
been too suspicious: 1
on my hand: 1
to steering the: 1
watch your step: 1
could tell him: 1
his fault he: 1
thinking when we: 1
and started heading: 1
office draco was: 1
if the playwright: 1
be hard to: 1
find words to: 1
and you were: 1
heard the term: 1
not have risked: 1
said harry i'm: 1
alcove and turned: 1
steer the conspiracy: 1
to remember harry: 1
don't even know: 1
harry had done: 1
this would happen: 1
extremely serious secret: 1
stretched i know: 1
i did said: 1
realize draco that: 1
them into position: 1
grounds of hogwarts: 1
he'd hurt draco: 1
at humans with: 1
coldly like you: 1
the climate changed: 1
thrown out of: 1
chocolate frog that: 1
with each other: 1
years of hominids: 1
they tried to: 1
looked at humans: 1
other supporters in: 1
in gasps of: 1
draco against people: 1
i asked all: 1
ended sadly and: 1
made professor flitwick: 1
people loved harry: 1
dead gerbil one: 1
went into feeding: 1
rowling coils and: 1
like people stuff: 1
and compared them: 1
saturdays like that: 1
find out but: 1
the problem isn't: 1
magical creature rather: 1
spun around and: 1
you know said: 1
in the end: 1
then everyone else: 1
it very hard: 1
of footsteps went: 1
keeping his voice: 1
where it was: 1
father for fools: 1
to do draco: 1
and the thought: 1
that no matter: 1
more wrong and: 1
already playing it: 1
as part of: 1
to convince dumbledore: 1
amount and draco: 1
explained that since: 1
that something you: 1
point and explain: 1
over to the: 1
have looked too: 1
intelligence evolved so: 1
equals said draco: 1
shock from showing: 1
secret about deoxyribose: 1
the word 'tragedy': 1
if harry was: 1
what would happen: 1
even so harry: 1
your hand draco: 1
he knew and: 1
harry potter grinned: 1
cold dread in: 1
house or he: 1
happen by accident: 1
increase the relative: 1
quite keep the: 1
was almost all: 1
months and that: 1
back on later: 1
way harry potter: 1
the answer was: 1
the new alpha: 1
ever to happen: 1
draco that in: 1
galleons just in: 1
twisty that sort: 1
vault key or: 1
made it perfect: 1
draco walked along: 1
to in the: 1
a high-pitched voice: 1
deeply which made: 1
would just get: 1
purify the world: 1
talking about yesterday: 1
in a small: 1
money was gone: 1
frightened little hufflepuff: 1
wizarding world and: 1
a scientist for: 1
could do something: 1
one in control: 1
long as i: 1
reasoning would make: 1
you buy granger: 1
in a high-pitched: 1
name and face: 1
draco didn't oh: 1
oh and before: 1
even what harry: 1
harry had once: 1
the point where: 1
will and draco: 1
and a strange: 1
planned it and: 1
was doomed so: 1
hurt and i'm: 1
to be thrown: 1
your beliefs those: 1
what we did: 1
the perspective of: 1
sure i could: 1
make sense because: 1
aging alpha yeroen: 1
had to become: 1
it better not: 1
voice harry potter: 1
robes looked oddly: 1
up i'm glad: 1
to me draco: 1
don't worry it: 1
work if you: 1
harry as they: 1
an absolute fool: 1
chimpanzee named luit: 1
more powerful scientist: 1
would learn just: 1
wanted the two: 1
today's scientists had: 1
supporters in the: 1
purpose except luring: 1
draco couldn't be: 1
mind - since: 1
the headmaster told: 1
could increase the: 1
ridiculously smarter than: 1
whisper please don't: 1
he might not: 1
so you can: 1
hall stomach churning: 1
up in draco: 1
the novel problems: 1
go get it: 1
free will and: 1
friend who had: 1
had done to: 1
his own free: 1
hard feelings said: 1
said after looking: 1
have no purpose: 1
side lucius thought: 1
a shaking voice: 1
- the memory: 1
rationality draco you: 1
one would want: 1
he had managed: 1
questions i asked: 1
to use your: 1
- no that: 1
already been informed: 1
and that he: 1
might take some: 1
shining into the: 1
away right now: 1
had been smart: 1
testify under veritaserum: 1
the second most: 1
was when professor: 1
be trying and: 1
blow the plot: 1
we were cooking: 1
would take two: 1
skeeter draco thought: 1
maybe and i: 1
conceal his true: 1
then he tried: 1
fool he'd been: 1
friendly he was: 1
a disguise to: 1
step draco was: 1
brilliant and gasping: 1
father had further: 1
the middle and: 1
the steering by: 1
luit had won: 1
tribes had to: 1
exhausted draco felt: 1
feeding the brain: 1
my expertise too: 1
what lucius should: 1
power over him: 1
window into the: 1
was two draco: 1
to provoke a: 1
his robes on: 1
this to me: 1
up together but: 1
hear that draco: 1
with that and: 1
they left the: 1
hating harry potter: 1
a terribly serious: 1
would prevail the: 1
yesterday draco yes: 1
the news came: 1
face why didn't: 1
guessed who did: 1
into the alcove: 1
limit was two: 1
else in just: 1
harry i'm sorry: 1
i would teach: 1
why didn't you: 1
what was wrong: 1
ways to test: 1
always ended up: 1
nikkie nikkie had: 1
to him draco: 1
sure i've been: 1
part of some: 1
might have no: 1
control of the: 1
serious business and: 1
someone actually as: 1
said carefully keeping: 1
serious matter this: 1
i was on: 1
adult chimpanzee named: 1
looked too suspicious: 1
each other or: 1
to interrupt at: 1
don't know enough: 1
be harry's friend: 1
please realize draco: 1
sick inside it: 1
started to say: 1
me a favor: 1
harry potter there: 1
like the last: 1
pressing it at: 1
and draco was: 1
face thinking about: 1
naturally said harry: 1
no matter the: 1
since only a: 1
outwit each other: 1
or we could: 1
the right parts: 1
you i knew: 1
right naturally said: 1
one - don't: 1
outsized brain must: 1
years but someday: 1
- what -: 1
she said it: 1
debt in a: 1
and that i'd: 1
any other species: 1
the time they'd: 1
in case harry: 1
better watch your: 1
trying to stay: 1
all of harry's: 1
mostly recover by: 1
them ending up: 1
months before we: 1
oddly askew as: 1
the effort because: 1
technology a natural: 1
did not think: 1
flitwick isn't going: 1
saturday it better: 1
circles hard and: 1
purism were right: 1
to find out: 1
note of accusation: 1
hate him anyway: 1
him on his: 1
was clear that: 1
they hadn't been: 1
that i would: 1
stared at harry: 1
to stop draco's: 1
got made in: 1
now sure said: 1
managing to put: 1
harry had kept: 1
unseen orca circles: 1
from being my: 1
pouch for granger: 1
to stay out: 1
just so that: 1
recover by the: 1
could grow up: 1
loved harry potter: 1
a program to: 1
lucius has who: 1
feelings said harry: 1
so likable that: 1
mental capacity 'cause: 1
not go like: 1
position just by: 1
it never hurt: 1
him as if: 1
that nothing like: 1
ally like draco: 1
to do anything: 1
that i'd turned: 1
guess i understand: 1
get access -: 1
voice sounding disappointed: 1
led to in: 1
tribe had to: 1
pleasure draco realized: 1
in shadow and: 1
together to discover: 1
one would go: 1
would teach you: 1
his plan of: 1
out of ravenclaw: 1
could guess what: 1
he'll check with: 1
them whenever a: 1
wasn't as valuable: 1
just a few: 1
cost to himself: 1
draco's stomach got: 1
the whole year: 1
that alcove harry: 1
his face why: 1
confronted the aging: 1
of scientific progress: 1
sort of plots: 1
been for his: 1
and in time: 1
intelligent servant like: 1
mine dumbledore thought: 1
all that was: 1
yesterday i rushed: 1
harry wanted draco: 1
and whatever the: 1
needed another loan: 1
problem is stronger: 1
draco yes you: 1
you the money: 1
the obvious my: 1
confrontation developed between: 1
harry walked along: 1
granted that no: 1
not sure i: 1
other options not: 1
glad to hear: 1
we be equals: 1
draco his heart: 1
should have made: 1
threaten someone at: 1
luring draco to: 1
a pretty good: 1
tools the reason: 1
do was write: 1
did something to: 1
we take anyone: 1
the window into: 1
very valuable hostage: 1
to skin that: 1
in sheer existential: 1
little hands and: 1
thought tore at: 1
the one snape: 1
way draco you: 1
found near the: 1
even if it: 1
little smarter to: 1
sorry i shouldn't: 1
only one person: 1
it might have: 1
his voice you: 1
switch to being: 1
before we take: 1
a fool would: 1
father might be: 1
was harry trying: 1
voice tried to: 1
a human's metabolic: 1
intervened directly in: 1
you would be: 1
for all draco: 1
you know how: 1
about it that: 1
be the repentant: 1
to draco then: 1
push without limits: 1
harry potter needed: 1
to solve all: 1
harry or you: 1
fight their battles: 1
of science to: 1
walked over to: 1
and so they: 1
harry trying to: 1
we would accept: 1
not quite succeeding: 1
lecturing me and: 1
the population and: 1
being evil draco: 1
last statement harry's: 1
been no good: 1
hanging slack like: 1
the other set: 1
to go i: 1
to believe that: 1
harry held power: 1
natural guess but: 1
you first i: 1
else only relative: 1
and delicate matter: 1
science things like: 1
it was you: 1
was trembling now: 1
if they hadn't: 1
other species that: 1
speechless father had: 1
we'd been associating: 1
the headmaster's office: 1
humans with their: 1
held power over: 1
didn't have any: 1
being speechless father: 1
path easy to: 1
can get access: 1
out he'd just: 1
whatever the answer: 1
suppressing his smile: 1
ought to be: 1
like this would: 1
been raised in: 1
she'll also feel: 1
statement was a: 1
the wizarding world: 1
harder to learn: 1
pomfrey say said: 1
as light and: 1
but you need: 1
father had said: 1
a frightened little: 1
real results the: 1
they'd reached the: 1
i rushed things: 1
wider and father: 1
yeroen with the: 1
unacceptable there was: 1
forgive a fork: 1
fights between luit: 1
go to the: 1
was unworkable it: 1
to be sure: 1
the repentant friend: 1
no hard feelings: 1
was indeed a: 1
the tribe had: 1
hand dangled limply: 1
i did the: 1
about the rule: 1
knew and who'd: 1
not permanent harry: 1
and then everyone: 1
day you know: 1
it that was: 1
answer was we: 1
a good front: 1
spending money father: 1
wall harry could: 1
agony had kept: 1
sight his face: 1
telling dumbledore to: 1
something dead madam: 1
the headmaster about: 1
nuclear weapons and: 1
harry potter's evil: 1
already worked that: 1
that much don't: 1
approached here ya: 1
to the window: 1
it to harry: 1
worked that out: 1
way harry was: 1
gringotts vault -: 1
try and stop: 1
any plot which: 1
at all why: 1
how he didn't: 1
draco would tell: 1
doomed so draco: 1
was still possible: 1
said without thinking: 1
it killed the: 1
enough to provide: 1
hero's plans every: 1
on him what: 1
worry harry potter: 1
if dumbledore hadn't: 1
recently matured chimpanzee: 1
be a price: 1
i could go: 1
he was now: 1
it took that: 1
weren't the voice: 1
where it needs: 1
in ways that: 1
suspect you and: 1
harry's enemy his: 1
it was far: 1
in a pleased: 1
the truth together: 1
again for as: 1
killed the mood: 1
eater harry potter's: 1
had told draco: 1
break it but: 1
vote father might: 1
things like deoxyribose: 1
potter would learn: 1
to respect my: 1
hurt you first: 1
harry potter could: 1
potter smiled slightly: 1
this people who: 1
wield the conspiracy: 1
worn a disguise: 1
on later if: 1
do this to: 1
describe the sheer: 1
draco but you: 1
that was great: 1
because if the: 1
was good for: 1
be friendly he: 1
right that's just: 1
was great from: 1
his target would: 1
play draco had: 1
was insane instead: 1
that last statement: 1
don't want to: 1
unless all that: 1
done you could: 1
weren't common enough: 1
his face there: 1
shaking voice harry: 1
to just accept: 1
him who did: 1
the real truth: 1
wasn't working it: 1
had been harry: 1
lawliet who'd worn: 1
far worse than: 1
would push and: 1
it could work: 1
trying to hurt: 1
himself all he: 1
you for advice: 1
in the population: 1
much he'd hurt: 1
in awe would: 1
me harry laughed: 1
and he did: 1
would send him: 1
harry actually was: 1
it wasn't even: 1
the organisms would: 1
mind ran into: 1
many more children: 1
nothing like this: 1
consistent selection pressure: 1
ahead of me: 1
professor flitwick spun: 1
potter i was: 1
didn't care what: 1
now if dumbledore: 1
why draco said: 1
wouldn't notice draco: 1
have to study: 1
opposed by another: 1
not intervened directly: 1
guess what sort: 1
of evil using: 1
now you're going: 1
voice should have: 1
now he wasn't: 1
not both but: 1
said harry at: 1
like this people: 1
didn't oh and: 1
said harry as: 1
of rationality and: 1
said what if: 1
because the environment: 1
have tried to: 1
around to make: 1
who invented something: 1
inside it had: 1
worse harry potter: 1
was a natural: 1
hurt someone you: 1
so said harry: 1
which required more: 1
other set of: 1
his throat professor: 1
that pouch for: 1
it meant destroying: 1
bayesian conspiracy means: 1
i ask a: 1
up flat blank: 1
small draco had: 1
to solve them: 1
be a scientist: 1
the whole thing: 1
statement harry's eyes: 1
intelligence was there: 1
making it very: 1
this is for: 1
of his own: 1
an ancient ring: 1
was a terrifying: 1
way too much: 1
still be so: 1
accept it yesterday: 1
plot that might: 1
the spell cast: 1
cutting charm then: 1
ominous words spoken: 1
the truth draco: 1
be emphasizing how: 1
a good mood: 1
up with the: 1
other one wouldn't: 1
alcove harry still: 1
what if lucius: 1
thing was indeed: 1
and neither would: 1
could maneuver them: 1
a brick wall: 1
was going to: 1
that runaway evolutionary: 1
harry potter smiled: 1
another brick wall: 1
would go to: 1
that again draco: 1
we did yesterday: 1
promote a mutation: 1
showing on his: 1
had it and: 1
terribly harry said: 1
would have looked: 1
demolish almost every: 1
thought you were: 1
and there's just: 1
so that draco: 1
as if he'd: 1
might even know: 1
all why did: 1
were always better: 1
long for draco: 1
we don't want: 1
want to provoke: 1
that footsteps approached: 1
harry politely telling: 1
times as many: 1
stars above no: 1
everyone had it: 1
a more powerful: 1
plans every time: 1
to eat and: 1
sense because if: 1
his heart like: 1
now what we: 1
gentle itself even: 1
draco just didn't: 1
day harry had: 1
anyone professor flitwick: 1
because he might: 1
stop you from: 1
draco's mind scrabbled: 1
what an absolute: 1
this is our: 1
draco had said: 1
learn just what: 1
harry should say: 1
ended up furthering: 1
learned about plotting: 1
best interest not: 1
of what we: 1
green grounds of: 1
time but i: 1
a little then: 1
the sheer gargantuan: 1
knowing harry was: 1
harry said finally: 1
whole thing was: 1
throat the plan: 1
to have more: 1
perspective of scientific: 1
mind if harry: 1
right into by: 1
it would not: 1
using legilimency just: 1
if dumbledore knew: 1
him and beside: 1
death eater now: 1
but he could: 1
worse probably maybe: 1
that plays like: 1
to see this: 1
wasting the effort: 1
for fools he: 1
flitwick started to: 1
guess if you: 1
fine he wouldn't: 1
two draco couldn't: 1
that and you'd: 1
buying that pouch: 1
you know one: 1
sheer gargantuan unworkability: 1
might even be: 1
be a limit: 1
came as a: 1
i shouldn't have: 1
worse than the: 1
which he had: 1
it himself the: 1
known what someone: 1
stating the obvious: 1
even larger plot: 1
both but then: 1
dumbledore's hands of: 1
go harry said: 1
race without limit: 1
have to try: 1
defeated yeroen overthrow: 1
would be as: 1
next why draco: 1
a concession that: 1
had prevented yeroen's: 1
new alpha with: 1
had warned draco: 1
plot to father: 1
ideas like human: 1
understand what you: 1
scientists had a: 1
it fair because: 1
me i am: 1
the vault key: 1
i was doomed: 1
would spread to: 1
even more i'll: 1
ring that could: 1
draco felt cold: 1
been harry had: 1
had been my: 1
informed the headmaster: 1
that his plan: 1
so can you: 1
try to teach: 1
did not have: 1
and brilliant inventions: 1
fool it took: 1
slowly dawning on: 1
bad words fine: 1
time they'd reached: 1
problem isn't that: 1
about things like: 1
a young recently: 1
shouted and cheered: 1
place so strange: 1
said quietly she: 1
did not make: 1
or anyone professor: 1
lonely mutation to: 1
draco simply couldn't: 1
harry's plot was: 1
one secret about: 1
spoken in gasps: 1
had described how: 1
would make if: 1
as smart as: 1
since draco couldn't: 1
can forgive a: 1
the real results: 1
it was hard: 1
what sort of: 1
into them on: 1
wanted to ask: 1
into sight his: 1
named the amount: 1
simply couldn't guess: 1
you went to: 1
difficult and afterward: 1
mistake you would: 1
think we're equals: 1
been obvious and: 1
that many more: 1
is that you: 1
a fight to: 1
there had to: 1
equal when it: 1
and the power: 1
famous book called: 1
accusation in his: 1
then the organisms: 1
harry why did: 1
harry would say: 1
for patterns and: 1
in bayesian conspiracy: 1
brain size of: 1
first step of: 1
when father had: 1
had all been: 1
lawliet had cleverly: 1
the brightness shone: 1
greek for all: 1
even be difficult: 1
been hugely disappointed: 1
control you answered: 1
he thought about: 1
kicked himself all: 1
must have taken: 1
both helped us: 1
now maybe and: 1
be grateful -: 1
in a friendly: 1
appreciate what millions: 1
of years of: 1
do something else: 1
possibly be more: 1
totally seen that: 1
reason for him: 1
he'd chewed out: 1
his head outward: 1
the boy-who-lived testify: 1
couldn't help but: 1
said that draco: 1
and splattered he: 1
trying to do: 1
the two of: 1
suppress a good: 1
cost cost terribly: 1
you answered some: 1
he'd been far: 1
to gryffindor which: 1
with him there: 1
it and brilliant: 1
book called chimpanzee: 1
on purpose instead: 1
teach you those: 1
veritaserum that draco: 1
dreams away from: 1
to you was: 1
and can predict: 1
father would send: 1
off to the: 1
being my equal: 1
been far worse: 1
years later that: 1
walked along with: 1
hadn't been in: 1
harry's voice tried: 1
what you were: 1
scenario if dumbledore: 1
invent better tools: 1
headmaster about the: 1
dumbledore does now: 1
now harry had: 1
over him for: 1
but please realize: 1
draco said managing: 1
wrong before people: 1
draco what happened: 1
what someone actually: 1
to do even: 1
ask so can: 1
toward draco right: 1
to go get: 1
though i expect: 1
size of a: 1
harry named the: 1
with harry's mind: 1
okay draco said: 1
of hogwarts the: 1
his best interest: 1
draco had tortured: 1
move against granger: 1
he did not: 1
it won't said: 1
there to make: 1
no purpose except: 1
far too late: 1
harry potter's methods: 1
three different things: 1
and had the: 1
enemy not suspect: 1
tried to take: 1
had so many: 1
that you're ignorant: 1
was no way: 1
reached the dungeons: 1
that would take: 1
mcgonagall has the: 1
course if you: 1
this you want: 1
many galleons just: 1
friend harry's move: 1
like draco had: 1
harry potter as: 1
conspiracy where it: 1
great hall for: 1
project draco gasped: 1
along with a: 1
that although it: 1
finally but please: 1
was a long: 1
like something dead: 1
see through at: 1
being enemies later: 1
that harry held: 1
to learn think: 1
i didn't want: 1
i'd hurt you: 1
dipped in the: 1
one harry might: 1
grinned sheepishly i: 1
changed and tribes: 1
the wizengamot willingly: 1
who'd worn a: 1
words to himself: 1
but this wasn't: 1
the alien incomprehensible: 1
study again next: 1
what else harry: 1
is that something: 1
the brain humans: 1
harry turned back: 1
to become smarter: 1
purebloods to have: 1
the time was: 1
concealed his face: 1
plot that was: 1
difficulty of its: 1
and also clear: 1
lucius thought that: 1
harry knew dumbledore's: 1
the game he: 1
that since only: 1
had never heard: 1
malfoy you know: 1
of a fitness: 1
meant destroying your: 1
mutation it was: 1
all harry raised: 1
had rules now: 1
pause and then: 1
had said and: 1
to the finish: 1
together but this: 1
would say of: 1
have been obvious: 1
on quite right: 1
would say or: 1
last out the: 1
draco would wield: 1
harry potter said: 1
neither would i: 1
natural guess if: 1
just to find: 1
draco to hate: 1
people who could: 1
keep his mouth: 1
harry tried to: 1
he could guess: 1
villain named lawliet: 1
it was absolutely: 1
it wasn't his: 1
fitness advantage didn't: 1
dumbledore looking all: 1
that draco had: 1
the defeated yeroen: 1
this were always: 1
guns and tanks: 1
although it was: 1
great hall stomach: 1
coils and strikes: 1
light about this: 1
was crazy was: 1
chimpanzee politics the: 1
draco right now: 1
could lose that: 1
spell cast on: 1
check with dumbledore: 1
i've abused our: 1
with that his: 1
things always better: 1
draco mentally kicked: 1
no no you: 1
there and draco: 1
so that we: 1
didn't happen because: 1
usual plotting going: 1
a fork with: 1
without limit -: 1
rule of three: 1
that was still: 1
by watching plays: 1
how sick inside: 1
had gone to: 1
write father and: 1
very hard for: 1
all the right: 1
relief and then: 1
and then we: 1
said seizing control: 1
and despair that: 1
doomed to have: 1
understood it you: 1
and without the: 1
friendship terribly harry: 1
work but i: 1
plotting by watching: 1
strange that he: 1
that draco he: 1
stood in that: 1
it - no: 1
not have to: 1
what harry wanted: 1
at it himself: 1
i know that: 1
head at that: 1
new new alpha: 1
started pulling together: 1
footsteps went off: 1
be even worse: 1
once you understood: 1
i guess because: 1
finished by saying: 1
harry potter harry: 1
he was doomed: 1
had walked into: 1
associating the worst: 1
addressing the problem: 1
ya'd better watch: 1
against people like: 1
different things to: 1
great from the: 1
in a place: 1
willingly or otherwise: 1
said putting pain: 1
professor flitwick threw: 1
use it and: 1
all the novel: 1
fools he would: 1
of its problems: 1
there was no: 1
churning there would: 1
you didn't have: 1
of increased mental: 1
in draco of: 1
draco said carefully: 1
his own good: 1
concealing his eagerness: 1
he'd woken up: 1
that out right: 1
launch a plot: 1
because you wanted: 1
that long for: 1
lord himself hadn't: 1
as long as: 1
revenge or even: 1
about plotting by: 1
than what you: 1
just by asking: 1
was that i: 1
quietly she said: 1
an expensive present: 1
quite right -: 1
out the whole: 1
you're lucius's heir: 1
professor flitwick look: 1
to teach him: 1
or do next: 1
just insane and: 1
your family's interests: 1
afraid not harry: 1
other tribes and: 1
conspiracy means right: 1
to say something: 1
heading toward the: 1
the game had: 1
rita skeeter draco: 1
harry potter had: 1
everyone else would: 1
him to see: 1
wasn't a frightened: 1
but human beings: 1
we study again: 1
beside draco harry: 1
and that refusing: 1
it at all: 1
churning in draco's: 1
have been cold: 1
prevented yeroen's other: 1
not harry said: 1
was promptly hauled: 1
say of course: 1
in control you: 1
it was just: 1
shouldn't have asked: 1
sure i'd be: 1
what millions of: 1
be as proud: 1
hundred years later: 1
20 of a: 1
harry was pretending: 1
draco said in: 1
back toward draco: 1
and drive some: 1
hold draco could: 1
play called the: 1
between them then: 1
make your enemy: 1
strikes unseen orca: 1
looking for ways: 1
loan it's way: 1
just me being: 1
draco dumbledore deduced: 1
charm then what: 1
or you could: 1
actually do the: 1
who'd been opposed: 1
then when the: 1
was like running: 1
well he could: 1
other - an: 1
you were a: 1
book had described: 1
to hear that: 1
wasn't even what: 1
wouldn't stop you: 1
any more but: 1
smart as light: 1
flitwick that the: 1
him and said: 1
in the fights: 1
abused our friendship: 1
frog that would: 1
clever and had: 1
i'm sorry i: 1
when we bring: 1
should mostly recover: 1
have totally seen: 1
thought about his: 1
of how sick: 1
him anyway harry: 1
for him to: 1
some money so: 1
draco you don't: 1
it's not permanent: 1
foolish gargoyles who: 1
thrown out and: 1
just the sort: 1
dumbledore indeed said: 1
did you buy: 1
harry at once: 1
knows the real: 1
that might take: 1
friends with you: 1
able to want: 1
at first they: 1
awkward if she: 1
and everyone had: 1
but i wanted: 1
provoke a fight: 1
galleons - then: 1
dumbledore knew and: 1
for a single: 1
ideas like the: 1
needs to go: 1
secret and delicate: 1
ravenclaw house or: 1
notice draco did: 1
human intelligence evolved: 1
something didn't have: 1
the mood in: 1
of harry's master: 1
draco could tell: 1
realized that it: 1
one person in: 1
what - and: 1
his throat the: 1
destroying your entire: 1
- since draco: 1
still a bit: 1
headmaster interrupted him: 1
been cold they: 1
even know what: 1
middle and then: 1
understood him then: 1
aid distracting them: 1
and now his: 1
because i don't: 1
unless just pretend: 1
the plan harry: 1
if he knew: 1
it should mostly: 1
was to give: 1
with a sudden: 1
did yesterday draco: 1
draco would play: 1
push i did: 1
said softly the: 1
i told professor: 1
my own idea: 1
hard and lean: 1
thought the thought: 1
told draco about: 1
been opposed by: 1
heart in his: 1
problem then you: 1
his left arm: 1
malfoy draco had: 1
the thought was: 1
why they had: 1
draco lied so: 1
my hand wasn't: 1
was you he: 1
not sure i'd: 1
they're a lot: 1
target would have: 1
that draco could: 1
relative frequency of: 1
of him as: 1
and lucius believed: 1
to hate him: 1
don't do that: 1
the boy-who-lived i: 1
the memory rose: 1
shut if he: 1
still possible after: 1
of the gold: 1
no way you: 1
harry a few: 1
his mind i: 1
draco about things: 1
was that only: 1
to keep his: 1
it meant to: 1
the question that: 1
conspiracy was my: 1
taken him to: 1
equals otherwise it: 1
so many different: 1
again and if: 1
to show no: 1
stop him from: 1
and betrayal into: 1
could always switch: 1
enough to believe: 1
tore at his: 1
have been speaking: 1
if he understood: 1
pomfrey said it's: 1
become smarter in: 1
can make things: 1
draco gasped no: 1
and cheered at: 1
their descendants a: 1
father had told: 1
lone sunbeam draco: 1
the hero's plans: 1
a strange thought: 1
draco understood him: 1
by trying to: 1
ran into a: 1
to madam pomfrey: 1
actually as smart: 1
gently pointed out: 1
plotting going much: 1
when the time: 1
face that was: 1
few more saturdays: 1
harry should be: 1
would be absolutely: 1
a fitness advantage: 1
exactly what was: 1
after they're both: 1
say lucius thought: 1
it you would: 1
by muggles it: 1
your plan well: 1
would take all: 1
you never learn: 1
were a malfoy: 1
flat blank the: 1
sheer existential reflex: 1
potter wasn't a: 1
and before you: 1
dangerous adventures so: 1
to tell light: 1
even if you: 1
think of the: 1
up a good: 1
asked draco if: 1
eyes growing wider: 1
two paths but: 1
was already playing: 1
been my own: 1
harry's master plan: 1
said i didn't: 1
isn't going to: 1
servant like a: 1
draco couldn't possibly: 1
harry what do: 1
as father thought: 1
no flitwick isn't: 1
ten times as: 1
draco even so: 1
all that many: 1
can't possibly steer: 1
friendly way so: 1
words spoken in: 1
robes on his: 1
mysterious secret the: 1
start a program: 1
said managing to: 1
just what lucius: 1
kept running through: 1
as proud of: 1
draco had walked: 1
later he was: 1
you were on: 1
his smile as: 1
their guns and: 1
father could lose: 1
terrifying fate indeed: 1
you don't have: 1
his side where: 1
program to pay: 1
adventures so i: 1
repentant friend who: 1
did to you: 1
plots might be: 1
actually was for: 1
for months before: 1
beside harry draco: 1
just pretend to: 1
draco had shouted: 1
his thoughts again: 1
of the questions: 1
in harry's best: 1
take anyone else: 1
just writing plays: 1
place i'll try: 1
closer the churning: 1
his plots might: 1
all those discoveries: 1
slightly i apologized: 1
could work if: 1
gargantuan unworkability of: 1
someday maybe in: 1
trying to sound: 1
step of harry's: 1
helped us out: 1
many people loved: 1
felt cold dread: 1
playwright would have: 1
to form an: 1
because i just: 1
forced out the: 1
help but ask: 1
the word we: 1
brick wall harry: 1
would accept it: 1
science draco said: 1
ancient ring that: 1
by another incredibly: 1
price and it: 1
turned back toward: 1
keep the shock: 1
nodded no problem: 1
suspicious but the: 1
plan was that: 1
would kill harry: 1
go back on: 1
what we study: 1
with a request: 1
had accidentally hurt: 1
didn't dare enter: 1
fault he was: 1
think pressing it: 1
tried to be: 1
was far too: 1
too suspicious but: 1
of months and: 1
lay madness there: 1
make sense once: 1
existential reflex harry: 1
life father had: 1
were ridiculously smarter: 1
dread in his: 1
request for a: 1
yeroen's other supporters: 1
the technology a: 1
instead of waiting: 1
felt last night: 1
the reason why: 1
i would just: 1
by accident and: 1
had given draco: 1
students stood in: 1
too suspicious harry: 1
then you want: 1
perfect revenge unless: 1
stern concealing his: 1
possibly steer the: 1
together is that: 1
me into so: 1
and people had: 1
that i've abused: 1
realized that he: 1
make things happen: 1
potter with his: 1
and that wasn't: 1
too late to: 1
real truth and: 1
face was carefully: 1
be foiled and: 1
and draco saw: 1
much harry named: 1
in just so: 1
him from wasting: 1
realized you went: 1
after what he'd: 1
be a death: 1
proud of him: 1
you and still: 1
with his mouth: 1
few galleons -: 1
no you wouldn't: 1
our friendship terribly: 1
as though stating: 1
just accept that: 1
ruin you and: 1
might see harry: 1
harry was making: 1
he'd been raised: 1
eat and ten: 1
- but he: 1
have thought of: 1
ending up with: 1
then what whispered: 1
professor flitwick started: 1
look very stern: 1
and dumbledore believed: 1
process had been: 1
world himself instead: 1
a dark torture: 1
to try and: 1
that hadn't been: 1
have to fake: 1
which was where: 1
i managed to: 1
possible scenario if: 1
got angry you: 1
be in his: 1
it said harry: 1
was wondering if: 1
like running into: 1
from it like: 1
from him just: 1
you did it: 1
real life only: 1
could have been: 1
looking all stern: 1
only one who: 1
on his robes: 1
promised professor flitwick: 1
right now you're: 1
valuable hostage though: 1
you did me: 1
maybe even brilliant: 1
a more intelligent: 1
learn all of: 1
you need to: 1
and grinned sheepishly: 1
that should have: 1
your tool and: 1
invented something didn't: 1
was wrong with: 1
you were always: 1
i just couldn't: 1
me draco said: 1
our world we: 1
vincent's voice now: 1
matter the cost: 1
a single day: 1
wasn't hard at: 1
entire life the: 1
- but harry: 1
ravenclaw so i: 1
lucius believed the: 1
start tomorrow for: 1
more i'll try: 1
common enough to: 1
raised in a: 1
potter and father: 1
of them you: 1
his voice caught: 1
but his reasoning: 1
never hurt to: 1
time i'm not: 1
lucius comes up: 1
to see through: 1
your power you'll: 1
the last one: 1
knew dumbledore's mysterious: 1
turned me and: 1
of the play: 1
my tool and: 1
wizards having fewer: 1
would just tell: 1
how much harry: 1
i won't even: 1
afterward father had: 1
harry was acting: 1
test it you're: 1
had then gone: 1
stop draco's revenge: 1
flitwick that this: 1
i got into: 1
listened with his: 1
saying that plays: 1
guess what harry: 1
question that should: 1
probably wouldn't even: 1
out of the: 1
i explained that: 1
potter before the: 1
us about how: 1
and mcgonagall has: 1
as possible the: 1
the environment stepped: 1
or otherwise and: 1
those ominous words: 1
ever but harry: 1
out to purify: 1
could destroy their: 1
try to stop: 1
this incredibly clever: 1
exactly what harry: 1
face and draco: 1
then gone on: 1
as they left: 1
thwart it -: 1
- had led: 1
already informed the: 1
a more loyal: 1
fewer children he: 1
to the authorities: 1
to him so: 1
and then when: 1
into another brick: 1
of harry potter's: 1
a mutation it: 1
almost every part: 1
but if dumbledore: 1
about this incredibly: 1
himself the hand: 1
could just see: 1
head stars above: 1
gotten away with: 1
had been a: 1
terms it meant: 1
dumbledore hadn't guessed: 1
implied unless all: 1
to carry out: 1
it comes to: 1
concession that hadn't: 1
be left with: 1
after looking around: 1
expertise too and: 1
tool and then: 1
then draco said: 1
the evolutionary origins: 1
help me or: 1
couldn't be a: 1
comprehend that he: 1
what was your: 1
then draco's mind: 1
strongest purebloods to: 1
can predict the: 1
thinks i belong: 1
secret delicate business: 1
accident and that: 1
enemy his plots: 1
an alliance with: 1
incomprehensible way he'd: 1
world of evil: 1
said you're lucius's: 1
his head stars: 1
playwright had known: 1
described how an: 1
out the word: 1
to migrate and: 1
him then draco's: 1
further explained that: 1
said it's not: 1
want to go: 1
said slowly shouting: 1
and if it: 1
very bad words: 1
to have weird: 1
much don't worry: 1
called the tragedy: 1
he grew up: 1
harry could be: 1
be blurred of: 1
his voice seeming: 1
belonged - harry: 1
them then seize: 1
much isn't it: 1
of a human's: 1
who would try: 1
after which harry: 1
at random any: 1
maybe well he: 1
in his chest: 1
you're mine -: 1
know what would: 1
face he knew: 1
all this dumbledoring: 1
was in ravenclaw: 1
lucius should be: 1
draco couldn't even: 1
giant chocolate frog: 1
his friend harry's: 1
harry potter and: 1
disguise to conceal: 1
forces of right: 1
explained that it: 1
limit the dark: 1
how kindly he'd: 1
and you aren't: 1
their life and: 1
of recursion -: 1
his side lucius: 1
could invent better: 1

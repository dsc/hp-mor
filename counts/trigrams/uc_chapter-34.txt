quirrell already turning: 1
containing three parchments: 1
alive how quickly: 1
quidditch without snitch: 1

when dark lord: 1
angrier mr potter: 1
strong as dark: 1

then indeed might: 1
as well as: 1
laughing without pause: 1
he tapped cheek: 1
maybe was just: 1
professor quirrell his: 1
dark or otherwise: 1
harry drew deep: 1
see what students: 1
not all slytherin: 1
empty skins inspired: 1
one level the: 1
rose against us: 1
needed remind them: 1

there was sound: 1
wrong your parents': 1
been half-expecting words: 1
quirrell sounding very: 1
are simply wrong: 1
glances granger would: 1
thought the only: 1
about mr potter: 1
me mark incompetence: 1
are for ears: 1
those armies could: 1
fear traitors because: 1
houses hogwarts the: 1
united facing divided: 1
against another your: 1
just few traitors: 1
words finished leaving: 1
your parents could: 1
conjuration only needed: 1
pathetic and if: 1
whoever's their house: 1
same problem everyone: 1
i not think: 1
professor quirrell's eyes: 1
their wishes as: 1
agree you miss: 1
potter spoke his: 1
lucius malfoy see: 1
face other risks: 1
quirrell he tapped: 1
if past history: 1
say if whole: 1
parchment burst into: 1
many small chances: 1
said harry we: 1
no longer heard: 1
others would already: 1
they did there: 1
podium his voice: 1
the rules are: 1
also costs them: 1
houses should still: 1
like they're going: 1
against country thousands: 1
been described the: 1
long since dead: 1
there were anti-malfoy: 1
his face now: 1
it's exactly same: 1
voice was bleak: 1
time had done: 1
the battlefield shot: 1
a soundless stress: 1
large transfigurations should: 1

your wish somehow: 1
neither us will: 1

although first there: 1
muggleborns students green-trimmed: 1

exchanged rapid glances: 1
called upon nation: 1
will to you: 1
as words finished: 1
even harry's chaotics: 1

same mistake next: 1
if cannot throw: 1
hogwarts draco son: 1
agreed take terrible: 1
father lord malfoy: 1

professor quirrell sounding: 1
or less without: 1
the words as: 1
him hoped his: 1
each other just: 1
battle we find: 1
or whatever was: 1
the future as: 1
fragmented weak how: 1
the tension released: 1
there were many: 1
parchments upon which: 1
the way would: 1
draco turned back: 1
or incompetence would: 1
your dorm-mates ravenclaw: 1

granger ravenclaw i'm: 1
mark then could: 1
cut himself off: 1
this too will: 1
up it people: 1

quirrell slowly turned: 1
said a sharp: 1
perfectly unified knowing: 1
were astonished murmurs: 1
quirrell his voice: 1
a tearing envelope: 1
confine yourself the: 1
just shrugged sorry: 1
lord's grasp once: 1
professor gazed out: 1

general chaos harry: 1
expression professor quirrell's: 1
most certainly harry: 1
like iron and: 1
attackers yes was: 1

muggles' science use: 1

if harry had: 1
proud be part: 1
potter has accepted: 1
will believe will: 1
friends hufflepuff surely: 1
muggles were greater: 1
see all when: 1
dark lord and: 1
because they're afraid: 1
what draco tried: 1
saves and lest: 1
students when draco: 1
chair glitter called: 1
born - enough: 1
lovely thing draco: 1
dissipate dreadful pressure: 1
stretched out fingers: 1
make clear soon: 1
that was how: 1
some laughter the: 1
potter said defense: 1
traitors might less: 1

dumbledore on faces: 1
she said nothing: 1
inscribed their wishes: 1
there were astonished: 1
never fight same: 1
three armies this: 1
problem everyone needing: 1

things differently they're: 1
years too young: 1
why mr malfoy: 1

flushing through him: 1
confidence your ability: 1

a sad little: 1
war broke out: 1
our elected minister: 1

to symbolize the: 1
professor quirrell's eyes: 1
easily manipulated as: 1
their quirrell points: 1

zabini tell me: 1
who he would: 1
way he was: 1
you knew that: 1
to give you: 1
speak of this: 1

and granger asked: 1
proudly even though: 1
twinge of malicious: 1
her eyes from: 1
a danger to: 1
numbers in the: 1
professor quirrell dryly: 1
seven different husbands: 1
know that and: 1
just because i: 1
figure out how: 1
leaders do exist: 1
have betrayed all: 1
a quite extraordinary: 1
and saying all: 1
longer aftermath draco: 1
took a single: 1
gaping idiot to: 1
else staying out: 1
the very end: 1
muggles if it: 1
voice was very: 1
by himself plus: 1
me the price: 1
grownups had to: 1

now beginning to: 1
best leader it's: 1
happens the headmaster: 1

and i doubt: 1
that and yooouuu're: 1
little uneasy but: 1
said and i: 1
many betrayals would: 1
much of his: 1
zabini blaise strolled: 1
trying to do: 1
harm i would: 1
is one person: 1
pathetic trying to: 1
if you're feeling: 1
by saying that: 1
time said draco: 1
the lesson of: 1
her until she: 1
at harry soon: 1
headmaster mr zabini: 1

to think and: 1
defense professor straightening: 1

forehead it's a: 1
the office he: 1
and if i: 1
his partial transfiguration: 1
front of the: 1

like this and: 1
if he was: 1
potter was fought: 1
fools they elect: 1

anyone who has: 1
and that professor: 1
of one student: 1
across his forehead: 1
hair in frustration: 1
power you took: 1
out between wizards: 1
to see mr: 1
professor quirrell coldly: 1
not stern as: 1

year harry sighed: 1
with me first: 1
our country could: 1
require this much: 1
plus or minus: 1
and if the: 1
on her face: 1
- for a: 1
with draco malfoy: 1
you would be: 1
even with all: 1
right away said: 1
so the nasty: 1
with anything more: 1
sometimes hid to: 1
three of you: 1
a whisper you: 1
at a time: 1
or other students: 1
people hate me: 1
that someone else: 1
aftermath blaise zabini: 1
war professor quirrell: 1

his cousin just: 1
reversed stupidity is: 1
safe at hogwarts: 1
thinking physics it: 1
toward the ravenclaw: 1

- the last: 1
she said i: 1
what it's like: 1
and that the: 1
i have heard: 1
friend blaise my: 1

the moisture would: 1
said hermione this: 1

just i wish: 1
tie would have: 1
mother that you: 1
quintuple agent -: 1
was he knew: 1
your childish meddling: 1
a time-out and: 1
granger she let: 1
quietly to make: 1
malfoy wizards went: 1
though harry could: 1
do something incriminating: 1
way suppose the: 1
read the rise: 1
though the head: 1
to the point: 1
hurt them he: 1
waiting for harry: 1
supposed to know: 1
unless you abandon: 1
me to talk: 1
to do with: 1
granger it really: 1
have to remember: 1
you know what's: 1
to do to: 1
was better than: 1
so draco looked: 1
he would have: 1
tests at this: 1
teach you a: 1
her lined face: 1
cousin either but: 1
own ways of: 1
faked a plot: 1
strode off toward: 1
that - i: 1
already visible on: 1
and i am: 1
it's about what's: 1
stop herself so: 1
the fools they: 1
ramps without slowing: 1
zabini and i: 1
to be good: 1
trembing with so: 1
with miss granger: 1
potter which you: 1
for him she'd: 1
then straightened shaking: 1
wizarding world took: 1
to stay out: 1
united states had: 1
failed and if: 1
otherwise sunshine said: 1
defense professor's voice: 1
declare the battle: 1
only dumbledore said: 1
the only serious: 1
to anyone who: 1
girls shouldn't have: 1
and there is: 1
with courage enough: 1
more trouble kimberly: 1
had to do: 1
that crazy is: 1
professor to do: 1
a hogwarts professor: 1
reluctance to turn: 1
said hermione that's: 1
sorry about that: 1
that there was: 1
- draco's fingers: 1
his desk when: 1
for slytherin lessons: 1
fascists some very: 1
fudge are not: 1
homework she'd always: 1
three gryffindors sometimes: 1
in gryffindor instead: 1
saw it disappear: 1
i would hear: 1
of disorientation and: 1
not have been: 1
extra politely and: 1
courage it's about: 1
partial transfiguration professor: 1
his plotting can: 1
the mudblood girl: 1
invisibility cloak step: 1
i did go: 1
then that too: 1
and give him: 1
five decades ago: 1
could offer is: 1
from the pages: 1
couldn't peacefully integrate: 1
was a strange: 1
students miss granger: 1
the truth was: 1
fine miss granger: 1
are in any: 1
alive can i: 1
defense professor's eyes: 1
tie that sort: 1
said blaise professor: 1
one that held: 1
child i'm sure: 1
you can see: 1
did blaise swallowed: 1
they pride themselves: 1
like this in: 1
vision until you: 1
mcgonagall let me: 1
me to said: 1
about it draco: 1
to take a: 1
childish meddling has: 1
in his fight: 1
i might go: 1
friend blaise whispered: 1
for free and: 1
was more trouble: 1
and i did: 1
in blank parchments: 1
serious candidates that: 1
miss granger you: 1
blinking such dangers: 1
tell me i: 1
him without setting: 1
cat still in: 1
stung fine said: 1
quirrell in a: 1
that was what: 1
still in the: 1
have stayed silent: 1
at least when: 1
a second wizarding: 1
seen the last: 1
heard and seen: 1
about harry practicing: 1
your proposals are: 1
blaise hesitated but: 1
potter hasn't corrupted: 1
heroes resentful and: 1
ask now why: 1
that but the: 1
failure look i'll: 1
lost to your: 1
few seconds your: 1
and nodded to: 1
hat everyone knows: 1
and gave a: 1
with careful self-imposed: 1
about dumbledore being: 1
said the cat: 1
fine thing and: 1
defense professor inclined: 1
war until later: 1
entertaining contest after: 1
cornelius fudge was: 1
generals for free: 1
of elections mr: 1
noticing where he: 1
they elect that: 1
crowd i am: 1
else would show: 1
for words the: 1
up and give: 1
name of your: 1
say not to: 1
it's probably not: 1
harry would combine: 1
kimberly blaise said: 1
could understand at: 1
face it is: 1
for his pet: 1
you are in: 1
a war broke: 1
that not on: 1
would be allowed: 1
an unused classroom: 1
white silver radiance: 1
mr potter the: 1
eyes who stared: 1
really stung fine: 1
to anyone i'll: 1
he didn't scream: 1
for the greater: 1
suggested democracy was: 1
hogwarts professor to: 1
try to do: 1
hope mr potter: 1
said a good: 1
world's stupidest person: 1
hesitated but his: 1
to that but: 1
again blaise backed: 1
blur your vision: 1
taken him more: 1
going at a: 1
be insane they: 1
you expected the: 1
the young slytherin: 1
artificial lightness just: 1
your vision until: 1
stayed silent and: 1
lord by himself: 1
to talk about: 1
invisibility off his: 1
harry could hear: 1
whispered mr hat: 1
the price the: 1
whisper with the: 1
looked up from: 1
the headmaster is: 1
everything will go: 1
my office and: 1
was beginning to: 1
save them but: 1
warning her if: 1
try anything like: 1
be pretty upset: 1
and science and: 1
a few estimates: 1
into his voice: 1
won't let anyone: 1
already failed and: 1
headmaster is drawing: 1
mark no matter: 1
they'll think malfoys: 1
anything just because: 1
simply saw what: 1
already realized that: 1
were the mysterious: 1
hear it from: 1
far more advanced: 1
my mother never: 1
to harm i: 1
you see mr: 1
wards at a: 1
go too far: 1
corrupted you too: 1
went to the: 1
threatening his cousin: 1
his only source: 1
you look to: 1
adult life so: 1
i took it: 1
the headmaster himself: 1
lord one dark: 1
between the dark: 1
for a long: 1
to make sure: 1
off toward his: 1
rest of humanity: 1
between cornelius fudge: 1
between wizards and: 1
am no friend: 1
courage enough for: 1
said blaise and: 1
not allowed to: 1
headmaster should somehow: 1
he passed blaise: 1
work grownups had: 1
moved to ch: 1
always wondered what: 1
she hadn't been: 1
mudblood girl and: 1
fine you're right: 1
at hermione and: 1
and snape were: 1
no child and: 1
tried to calm: 1
a nearby desk: 1
it is ridiculous: 1
and you simply: 1
you for my: 1
stop looking it: 1
i doubt that: 1
no intention of: 1
he was still: 1
a-whirl with speculations: 1
she'd almost asked: 1
don't know that: 1
sometimes i forget: 1
childish and undignified: 1
was just sitting: 1
something you're not: 1
marry her after: 1
putting him to: 1
it ought to: 1
i wanted to: 1
show i was: 1
read in his: 1
his plots harry: 1
ganging up and: 1
adult games and: 1
if you cannot: 1
them with anything: 1
could ever be: 1
if it did: 1
go ask harry: 1
other secrets you've: 1
this point dumbledore: 1
backed uneasily away: 1
aren't supposed to: 1
afraid mr potter: 1
draco concentrate -: 1
dry whispering voice: 1
and that was: 1
miss granger i'm: 1
bundle of rods: 1
of magic even: 1
calm and that: 1
only wished to: 1
dumbledore when fighting: 1
up from his: 1
powerful wizards and: 1
that blaise knew: 1
stuffed into his: 1
buffoon who is: 1
of one dictator: 1
professor quirrell reacted: 1
mirthless laugh perhaps: 1
any case doomed: 1
thought was occurring: 1
when you looked: 1
it disappear by: 1
okay with that: 1
actually blaise said: 1
doubt that the: 1
the seventh to: 1
division said professor: 1
had fled while: 1
convey a quizzical: 1
it just for: 1
then turned decisively: 1
her and blaise: 1
so i have: 1
a war of: 1
my standing offer: 1
just leaving the: 1
chuckle indeed said: 1
cornelius fudge are: 1
with hermione and: 1
professor quirrell's dry: 1
in your mother's: 1
did what you: 1
mcgonagall smiled wryly: 1
good she said: 1
between students and: 1
have wanted me: 1
and that unnerved: 1
he no i: 1
to them that: 1
i have already: 1
dorm eyes unseeing: 1
decisively and strode: 1
my house stay: 1
me if you: 1
be this childish: 1
should strongly advise: 1
i'm worried about: 1
sure that harry: 1
to explaaaaain -: 1
word just turned: 1
lord didn't go: 1
who did blaise: 1
last war mr: 1
this because young: 1
read a book: 1
was well harry: 1
incriminating - so: 1
mcgonagall and her: 1
unnerved harry a: 1
strength - so: 1
going to be: 1
sorting hat offer: 1
marks in history: 1
no need to: 1
they were the: 1
forcing a tie: 1
whispering voice from: 1
i wished to: 1
couldn't know until: 1
or noticing where: 1
all the obvious: 1
professor quirrell i: 1
such dangers said: 1
good enough for: 1
on his forehead: 1
does the headmaster: 1
but he'd seen: 1
that are wrong: 1
to be discussed: 1
anything to do: 1
- you did: 1
of the magical: 1
you because you: 1
potter that i: 1
end up fighting: 1
to ch 32: 1
gather beneath it: 1
but it ought: 1
school who deals: 1
was only being: 1
was very hard: 1
of information about: 1
brilliant and beautiful: 1
forget that you: 1
and fall of: 1
to the first: 1
not have hinted: 1
cold voice that: 1
rise and fall: 1
granger and be: 1
n if you're: 1
of being argued: 1
was why it: 1
think and a: 1
betrayed seven different: 1
cause trouble between: 1
simple by lucius: 1
no dangers in: 1
would teach battle: 1
headmaster that you: 1
event occur again: 1
zabini by threatening: 1
you - no: 1
a war until: 1
one who's that: 1
her after he: 1
wizards are not: 1
are friends for: 1
advanced book of: 1
boy stumbled but: 1
about courage it's: 1
leaned back in: 1
to calm down: 1
them died mysteriously: 1
struggling for words: 1
high chance that: 1
he knew the: 1
to fail um: 1
leach who had: 1
this way suppose: 1
in a perfect: 1
also offered to: 1
through the hallways: 1
followers had been: 1
italian fascists some: 1
trouble remembering what: 1
of companions if: 1
with that harry: 1
come up with: 1
it's not about: 1
world from what: 1
his pet hero: 1
did go with: 1
to make heroes: 1
explaaaaain - draco's: 1
elected during that: 1
and stuffed into: 1
lord alone while: 1
said in a: 1
he'd nudged the: 1
you had not: 1
the test and: 1
our battle end: 1
to know professor: 1
you can talk: 1
it's a single: 1
looked back down: 1
headmaster himself blaise: 1
blue and advocated: 1
trying to read: 1
physics it was: 1
few estimates with: 1
a magical dictatorship: 1
snape were the: 1
i forget that: 1
was still doing: 1
was alone hermione: 1
now you're making: 1
seen no need: 1
trouble kimberly could: 1
the odd feeling: 1
of the line: 1
boy-who-lived could easily: 1
one else was: 1
deduce your ownership: 1
waited for a: 1
history over the: 1
but professor quirrell: 1
i will say: 1
their followers not: 1
who heard the: 1
prophet which lucius: 1
into the ancient: 1
scientific civilization reaching: 1
something wrong with: 1
slowly toward the: 1
mouth open struggling: 1
professor was crazier: 1
how old was: 1
mad you see: 1
not seem to: 1
least one vengeance: 1
place strength flows: 1
something more interesting: 1
malfoy neither of: 1
make sure that: 1
who'll love me: 1
and he said: 1
mages and muggles: 1
call a time-out: 1
believe said professor: 1
zabini i will: 1
draco had ever: 1
proposals are extremely: 1
leader who was: 1
i should strongly: 1
could manage to: 1
expects you to: 1
i will not: 1
who'd do something: 1
said hermione still: 1
own lips and: 1
professor mcgonagall's voice: 1
he went up: 1
quirrell waited for: 1
insane they pride: 1
elect that is: 1
they could use: 1
magic is he: 1
that harry was: 1
now it's fine: 1
was sweating under: 1
anyone who heard: 1
him in his: 1
then mum hadn't: 1
depart but i: 1
breathing professor quirrell: 1
his monster into: 1
stories mr potter: 1
harry had already: 1
and what do: 1
estimates with hermione: 1
of whoever or: 1
between working in: 1
off miss granger: 1
mist now beginning: 1
bound together to: 1
slytherin don't know: 1
so what did: 1
it was probably: 1
insulted and nodded: 1
practicing his partial: 1
evacuate all the: 1
looking straight into: 1
general the real: 1
the world could: 1
to speak them: 1
be insane pretending: 1
of harry potter: 1
eight years old: 1
desk reading a: 1
nor that i: 1
was also possible: 1
little student rivalry: 1
you blaise knew: 1
professor quirrell hadn't: 1
present them with: 1
headmaster has trouble: 1
on purpose miss: 1
anyone it was: 1
let draco concentrate: 1
like me but: 1
very much in: 1
hands over her: 1
at a nearby: 1
who thinks in: 1
with the gryffindor: 1
of an invisibility: 1
and their followers: 1
of your employer: 1
i am no: 1
heart with courage: 1
to the whole: 1
and vanished only: 1
only happens in: 1
i should not: 1
because i say: 1
doubt aftermath blaise: 1
slytherins would he: 1
dry voice in: 1
come to me: 1
when fighting a: 1
his fight against: 1
president of the: 1
more interesting to: 1
only being selfish: 1
all the power: 1
and fifty marked: 1
containing professor mcgonagall's: 1
it continue for: 1
cat had spoken: 1
she said and: 1
think my concerns: 1
it happens the: 1
speak them oh: 1
slightest familiarity with: 1
it told me: 1
calmer now that: 1
whole magical world: 1
fine said hermione: 1
an odd reluctance: 1
decades ago being: 1
error which draco: 1
earlier so draco: 1
professor mcgonagall paused: 1
uneasy but it: 1
wizards and muggles: 1
use any help: 1
zabini who he: 1
he told you: 1
ever worried or: 1
professor mcgonagall smiled: 1
prevent the repetition: 1
i just have: 1
whole wizarding world: 1
his name is: 1
this to anyone: 1
a child i'm: 1
until she was: 1
invalid all three: 1
but if you: 1
perhaps the headmaster: 1
slytherins if the: 1
upward knowing that: 1
with ill ends: 1
hand across his: 1
integrate when the: 1
newspaper i read: 1
can't have everyone: 1
being beaten and: 1
cold in his: 1
i don't think: 1
fear down blaise's: 1
dryly and if: 1
was eight years: 1
hadn't betrayed seven: 1
felt a twinge: 1
professor quirrell who: 1
owned in fee: 1
had never heard: 1
idea that unity: 1
was already leaning: 1
looked a little: 1
obscure the face: 1
sang harry potter: 1
pretend to hand: 1
tell me who: 1
stay safe miss: 1
trying to stay: 1
on harry's face: 1
a book called: 1
not zabini and: 1
mask to be: 1
rivalry between students: 1
things and if: 1
i myself at: 1
has two copies: 1
her army everything: 1
shut up and: 1
who did right: 1
black mist seemed: 1
from a shadowy: 1
details and what: 1
and chose between: 1
suppose the enemy: 1
harry trudged slowly: 1
didn't vanish it: 1
two copies of: 1
and her voice: 1
trying to make: 1
chance that it: 1
was a little: 1
to gather beneath: 1
had i intended: 1
speeches the fools: 1
and cloak i: 1
policy of not: 1
with speculations was: 1
moon-colored sunlight and: 1
that my hinted: 1
him she'd be: 1
were truly the: 1
not grown up: 1
he can't do: 1
mark - powerful: 1
feeling a little: 1
i already know: 1
now a final: 1
of a girl: 1
the stories about: 1
but then why: 1
she's really being: 1
not after fighting: 1
much self-control and: 1
like to ask: 1
was sort of: 1

before albus had: 1
knowledge was lost: 1
a slytherin that: 1
eyes were set: 1
professor quirrell quietly: 1
bullies into doing: 1
why it was: 1
his head and: 1
lord and fifty: 1
scared enough of: 1
first time said: 1
slowness his heart: 1
hat tilted oh: 1
his pouch he: 1
of his young: 1
you advocate said: 1
good to see: 1
child and he: 1

wall blaise zabini: 1
in the rough: 1
was to grasp: 1
to match professor: 1
curiosity was eating: 1
if afterward a: 1
that clever insight: 1
silent and consulted: 1
be allowed to: 1
girl and wipe: 1
a ravenclaw in: 1
with each other: 1
war that killed: 1
excellent said the: 1
plan and if: 1
saviour of the: 1

you're not comfortable: 1
harry sat there: 1
i was old: 1
was a great: 1
over again i: 1
nearby desk reading: 1
that nothing really: 1

something like this: 1
a country take: 1
than her and: 1
crazy is dumbledore: 1
without slowing speeding: 1
is no different: 1
between professor quirrell: 1
then harry would: 1
in a clear: 1
grow up revering: 1
for young girls: 1
much it would: 1
and every single: 1
who is owned: 1
in professor mcgonagall's: 1
to grasp the: 1
traveled away somehow: 1
a suggestion anyone: 1
again i don't: 1
of action you: 1
to keep politicians: 1
professor mcgonagall said: 1
house stay safe: 1

you can't have: 1

standing in open-mouthed: 1
uncharacteristic of the: 1
more than one: 1
thought the rivalry: 1
took down the: 1
isn't to produce: 1
you were the: 1
mark they would: 1
will not declare: 1
as he passed: 1
was at least: 1
genuinely selected as: 1
do to keep: 1
and down ramps: 1
and caution present: 1
one student five: 1
everything his voice: 1
said swallowing again: 1
smiled wryly perhaps: 1
was a black: 1
to do said: 1
in the muggle: 1
forehead i got: 1
was well i'll: 1
price the defense: 1
the repetition of: 1
her eyes just: 1
against the wall: 1
also the price: 1
a plot in: 1
fooling himself and: 1
draco looked up: 1
something your proposals: 1
and lost the: 1
of humanity no: 1
that we have: 1
mask behind the: 1
i know as: 1
candidates that cornelius: 1
from fighting him: 1
chaos than putting: 1
blaise strolled through: 1
quirrell would have: 1
father's probably going: 1
voice she's real: 1
the boy stumbled: 1
dark lord one: 1
and you will: 1
other in a: 1
quirrell dryly and: 1
enough for three: 1
general chaos than: 1
dumbledore was the: 1
girl in ravenclaw: 1
turned the corner: 1
there or that: 1
spat upon couldn't: 1
a little uneasy: 1
from behind his: 1
up and let: 1
the whole wizarding: 1
do not suggest: 1
proves the rule: 1
people asked me: 1
to determine whether: 1
whisper you would: 1
that the sky: 1
was bright and: 1
it was impossible: 1
didn't matter who: 1
harry would have: 1
with potter there: 1
tell me also: 1
keep you any: 1
shall follow them: 1
if professor quirrell: 1
you to get: 1
hard for harry: 1
voice in his: 1
cloak then turned: 1
atop the cloak: 1
in slytherin don't: 1
but there were: 1
what i wanted: 1
serious look on: 1
magic elected during: 1
a tie would: 1
really all that: 1
sell out mr: 1
every single one: 1
in an unused: 1
civilization reaching outward: 1
not declare the: 1
knew he was: 1
me start by: 1
complicated they have: 1
anyone i'll be: 1
mildly you must: 1
completely evil like: 1
ancient wards at: 1
keep her eyes: 1
paintings or other: 1
nest of cubbyholes: 1
scream slowly he: 1
said the defense: 1
hermione was just: 1
the office of: 1
quidditch is transparent: 1
a n if: 1
out how to: 1
head below had: 1
the way to: 1
no friend of: 1

just what you: 1
suggest that any: 1
fascinating things that: 1
so she hadn't: 1
with that it: 1
easy to imperius: 1
it's fine miss: 1
decided that they: 1
aftermath hermione granger: 1
them really wanted: 1
nodded as i: 1
the headmaster should: 1
whispery chuckle well: 1
think professor quirrell: 1
the reward i: 1
vengeances said blaise: 1
of slytherins who'll: 1
sat at a: 1
from your own: 1
harry had no: 1
you are young: 1
it with me: 1
slowly fading as: 1
significant to him: 1
like to be: 1
your mother's footsteps: 1
harry a cold: 1
to feel a: 1
and knowing the: 1
not to hurt: 1
of magic elected: 1
the headmaster hadn't: 1
up fighting the: 1
said draco harry: 1
wizards to mars: 1
he could understand: 1
a muuudbloood what: 1
for students to: 1
tell anyone it: 1
out fine you're: 1
got any vengeances: 1
quite extraordinary fool: 1
but there're also: 1
a high chance: 1
of everyone else: 1
granger has two: 1
couldn't live in: 1
the magical allele: 1
his chair and: 1
you already know: 1
details just proposed: 1
hands through his: 1
eyes just saw: 1
headmaster thought the: 1
other word just: 1
which draco malfoy: 1
off alarms quirrell: 1
again you may: 1
than putting him: 1
the rivalry was: 1
professor mcgonagall might: 1
the hat tilted: 1
protect me if: 1
if he and: 1
have taken dumbledore's: 1
billion muggles if: 1
is dumbledore and: 1
professors who'd do: 1
do something more: 1
a minute after: 1
wipe out her: 1
reacted just the: 1
been shouting i: 1
bright and brilliant: 1
potter the stupidity: 1
minus a small: 1
that wish -: 1
she said in: 1
unity is stronger: 1
with the murder: 1
higher level than: 1
of work grownups: 1
to keep the: 1
the polls and: 1
are you said: 1
no matter how: 1
britain's recent history: 1
the bullies into: 1
during that period: 1
most fascinating things: 1
to her that: 1
childish enthusiasm harry: 1
he was trembing: 1
of failure look: 1
games and sometimes: 1
two of them: 1
the voters that: 1
believe potter the: 1
to see it: 1
stare tell me: 1
her miss granger: 1
been frightened only: 1
ought to take: 1
the crowd i: 1
a black mist: 1
harry practicing his: 1
time hermione had: 1
be good she: 1
a buffoon who: 1
footsteps go and: 1
the dark mark: 1
you as to: 1
want to cause: 1
who could have: 1
life so many: 1
than her again: 1
why you suggested: 1
governed by a: 1
quirrell had forgotten: 1
messenger didn't approach: 1
that the moisture: 1
asked her how: 1
country that would: 1
the whisper however: 1
still have to: 1
a battle earlier: 1
was uncharacteristic of: 1
with a muuudbloood: 1
never heard of: 1
of people asked: 1
should somehow discover: 1
he is no: 1
of letting a: 1
what protection i: 1
you survive it: 1
until later mr: 1
follow them harry: 1
should have guessed: 1
but it's good: 1
didn't approach her: 1
but i had: 1
elections isn't to: 1
i am afraid: 1
classroom and trying: 1
nudged the bullies: 1
me directly i: 1
hinted had i: 1
quirrell's dry voice: 1
on to your: 1
saying all the: 1
his cousin either: 1
make that wish: 1
of people hate: 1
the mysterious boy-who-lived: 1
chuckle it's good: 1
probably not important: 1
by threatening his: 1
blaise and she: 1
whether the people: 1
hear professor quirrell's: 1
gryffindor instead of: 1
world could ever: 1
slytherin that really: 1
human it was: 1
intention of being: 1
to the rest: 1
turned in that: 1
it was one: 1
harry potter or: 1
rough range of: 1
- so what: 1
then why would: 1
have keyed his: 1
said i couldn't: 1
back and blurred: 1
in frustration he: 1
explanation they stop: 1
simply mad you: 1
war alone that: 1
already guessed the: 1
is strength -: 1
granger asked professor: 1
and the cat: 1
students he went: 1
was genuinely selected: 1
copies of the: 1
sincerely trying to: 1
wasn't what i: 1
did not devise: 1
slytherin lessons then: 1
i can you: 1
that you were: 1
be a peril: 1
anything like this: 1
get into professor: 1
over often meet: 1
but i don't: 1
it was also: 1
drawing you into: 1
father's frieeeends think: 1
because young ravenclaw: 1
happens in stories: 1
advocate said harry: 1
for slytherin before: 1
and while dumbledore: 1
to show i: 1
just killed you: 1
in the course: 1
you and who: 1
secrecy inevitably broke: 1
crushing you a: 1
to trust again: 1
end that someone: 1
told me i: 1
going to work: 1
she'd always wondered: 1
besides who said: 1
have been brilliant: 1
elaborate and his: 1
student rivalry was: 1
quirrell gave a: 1
not speak of: 1
of the most: 1
you any longer: 1
said the societies: 1
mcgonagall hastily you're: 1
only a meddler: 1
professor quirrell so: 1
did it occur: 1
familiarity with muggle: 1
a terribly sad: 1
a little sad: 1
granger or isn't: 1
was probably about: 1
sort of work: 1
than dictatorship -: 1
in the world: 1
in history of: 1
done well in: 1
take the mark: 1
chair and spoke: 1
be sane pretending: 1
and undignified at: 1
was blushing furiously: 1
students in hogwarts: 1
and b professor: 1
have already guessed: 1
his young students: 1
enough and she: 1
hand them in: 1
any longer aftermath: 1
now little slytherin: 1
all your father's: 1
not to take: 1
to my office: 1
miss granger and: 1
silent for a: 1
a good man: 1
headmaster asks too: 1
congratulations on having: 1
of magical britain: 1
that if i: 1
but i should: 1
working in groups: 1
the ancient wards: 1
common enemy harry: 1
offer you -: 1
because if it: 1
sure he must: 1
dark lord alone: 1
you simply saw: 1
quirrell said mildly: 1
and tania leach: 1
a flawed leader: 1
a muuudbloood sang: 1
what i have: 1
be there or: 1
spoke the defense: 1
control his voice: 1
of nowhere and: 1
trees anyone who: 1
hate me now: 1
make it dark: 1
of the united: 1
ministers of magic: 1
granger i'm worried: 1
inclined his head: 1
saturday not after: 1
his sight could: 1
argument it's not: 1
worry was showing: 1
alcove as he: 1
said his voice: 1
wait for any: 1
to the very: 1
a higher level: 1
number of companions: 1
you were truly: 1
albus had i: 1
into his plots: 1
is there what: 1
- i see: 1
don't go completely: 1
up stairs and: 1
quirrell hadn't realized: 1
knows that dumbledore's: 1
as to who: 1
turned decisively and: 1
and despite everything: 1
the rough range: 1
to said blaise: 1
conversation over again: 1
now do you: 1
her that professor: 1
this christmas but: 1
out of his: 1
one plot going: 1
sometimes his plotting: 1
mum hadn't betrayed: 1
next year harry: 1
nobody expects you: 1
did the sorting: 1
was eating him: 1
the headmaster that: 1
my own house: 1
well i mean: 1
and consulted with: 1
sight could manage: 1
one dark lord: 1
how many wizards: 1
professor's voice can: 1
fighting a battle: 1
am afraid mr: 1
the first time: 1
and stood up: 1
about fooling himself: 1
me at once: 1

not intelligence the: 1
the wall blaise: 1
they also believed: 1
in your future: 1
just proposed turning: 1
from the headmaster: 1
all right to: 1
nation no he: 1
outward looking upward: 1
he'd been hoping: 1
what you told: 1
vanished only it: 1
if you survive: 1
the new chapter: 1
my concerns were: 1
plots that elaborate: 1
life at least: 1
went up stairs: 1
leaped out of: 1
single mark they: 1
he the wisest: 1
headmaster had said: 1
class and pretend: 1
mean in that: 1
events blur away: 1
and beautiful glowing: 1
the cat still: 1

harry didn't end: 1
it didn't vanish: 1
excellent marks in: 1

cloak but then: 1
and have courage: 1
an ad hominem: 1
by lucius malfoy: 1
and dumbledore and: 1
quirrell's eyes who: 1
he trod it: 1
and figure out: 1

professor quirrell gave: 1
of today's battle: 1
mark in kind: 1
as transparently silly: 1
beaten and spat: 1
wizarding war that: 1
much in favor: 1
said with obviously: 1
forest obscured by: 1
whether the figure: 1
again the whispery: 1

whitening where they: 1
if you say: 1
her if she'd: 1
would combine magic: 1
neither of them: 1
a light mark: 1
what did you: 1
dumbledore said harry: 1
enemy just imperiuses: 1
have a mask: 1
took the mark: 1
without looking up: 1
for the plan: 1
she took them: 1
revering the game: 1
than one plot: 1
cousin kimberly blaise: 1
generals and i: 1
but he didn't: 1
i asked her: 1
not suggest trying: 1
there were in: 1
only startled the: 1
only one who's: 1
more nuanced than: 1
had also offered: 1
truth was well: 1
straightened as though: 1

cubbyholes containing professor: 1

professor quirrell's departure: 1
him you may: 1
make with a: 1
by the trees: 1
and i took: 1
whoever or whatever: 1
that draco had: 1
say to that: 1
no one else: 1
other students he: 1
said harry and: 1
his voice perhaps: 1
a million but: 1
a little shriek: 1
resentful and bitter: 1
disorientation and blaise: 1
healthy for young: 1
to evacuate all: 1
somehow discover that: 1
say but i: 1
that way he: 1
her eyes when: 1
toward his meeting: 1
there with his: 1
suggested gryffindor for: 1
lucius malfoy wizards: 1

all that interesting: 1
could make with: 1
potter or draco: 1
like you and: 1

a great rivalry: 1
shaking off the: 1
your future career: 1
it a lot: 1
said the unidentifiable: 1
a long moment: 1
or that you: 1

stupidity is not: 1
and prevent the: 1
is ridiculous to: 1
this we will: 1
occur again you: 1
fled professor quirrell: 1
dumbledore and he'll: 1
meddle in adult: 1
so easy to: 1
harry didn't care: 1

worthy leaders do: 1
headmaster asks you: 1
hermione just didn't: 1
not comfortable with: 1

might also think: 1
you're looking for: 1
you said hermione: 1
into endorsing a: 1
such an event: 1
at a higher: 1
and tell me: 1
from his book: 1
come now little: 1
into the black: 1
muuudbloood what will: 1
it from your: 1
crazier than dumbledore: 1
being involved was: 1
and strode off: 1
at that not: 1
secret explanation they: 1
nowhere and said: 1
closed briefly then: 1
side as if: 1
transfiguration professor mcgonagall's: 1
his mind asking: 1
involved in something: 1
consulted with me: 1
sitting in an: 1
managed to stop: 1
from going to: 1
your christmas presents: 1
contest after the: 1
student five decades: 1
a worthy leader: 1
if i worked: 1
at the black: 1
army everything will: 1
think that a: 1
dumbledore said that: 1
the rule since: 1
that they were: 1
of elections isn't: 1
letting a war: 1
not meet again: 1
in complications and: 1
to at least: 1
stones within his: 1
childish nor that: 1
seventh to marry: 1
anyone could make: 1
a little calmer: 1
i read mentioned: 1
b professor quirrell: 1
anything indeed tell: 1
you ruined your: 1
can you are: 1
absolute gaping idiot: 1
are no dangers: 1
gave a whispery: 1
and if he: 1
broad-brimmed black hat: 1
knew about and: 1
also possible to: 1
we have spoken: 1
- i believe: 1
his own i: 1
any age hey: 1
do unless you: 1
blurred out the: 1
know until i: 1
you to make: 1
to your mother: 1
young students miss: 1
of money really: 1
future saviour of: 1
at least the: 1
that professor mcgonagall: 1
did come down: 1
a final question: 1
battle invalid all: 1
secrets you've told: 1
fighting a war: 1
betrayals would certainly: 1
to one side: 1
wryly perhaps i: 1
in his chair: 1
of them would: 1
you too much: 1
the hallways with: 1
and bitter to: 1
agent and you: 1
mark of a: 1
caution present them: 1
sharp then that: 1
one most important: 1
alliances with draco: 1
muggle history over: 1
professor professor mcgonagall: 1
wizards there were: 1
to hurt them: 1
may contact me: 1
afterward a war: 1
truly the equal: 1
him excellent marks: 1
nasty people got: 1
or minus a: 1
one best leader: 1
country into a: 1
said go ahead: 1
just turned and: 1
it did come: 1
working with a: 1
who was losing: 1
slytherin before she'd: 1
the kind of: 1
leader our country: 1
could hear professor: 1
blaise didn't wait: 1
there are no: 1
if you try: 1
looking it does: 1
of her favorite: 1
potter and the: 1
who might also: 1
hermione was blushing: 1
wanted me to: 1
of albus dumbledore: 1
girls the headmaster: 1
the headmaster actually: 1
the other secrets: 1
a tie why: 1
but sometimes his: 1
adult style and: 1
was there something: 1
turned in blank: 1
threats were just: 1
enough not to: 1
complications and caution: 1
be there right: 1
he must have: 1
silver radiance like: 1
not to tell: 1
down the dark: 1
fine afterward but: 1
said after another: 1
after professor quirrell's: 1
harry didn't say: 1
professor mcgonagall and: 1
get your christmas: 1
blaise his voice: 1
little shriek before: 1
have urgent business: 1
and yooouuu're not: 1
the same direction: 1
wasn't dumb only: 1
dumbledore the headmaster: 1
refused to let: 1
too is childish: 1
lessons then that: 1
war will teach: 1
know that hermione: 1
got their name: 1
which lucius malfoy: 1
sunshine said blaise: 1
cat leaped out: 1
selfish wanting you: 1
be a danger: 1
any other word: 1
his own face: 1
the slightest familiarity: 1
when she took: 1
school who thinks: 1
i asked mum: 1
test and lost: 1
to your common: 1
to keep and: 1
headmaster actually blaise: 1
was losing the: 1
hermione in startlement: 1
not going to: 1
but i would: 1
whispery chuckle indeed: 1
maybe if he: 1
it didn't matter: 1
the enthusiastic illusions: 1
you may go: 1
what her mind: 1
better than all: 1
indeed said the: 1
and cloak but: 1
stairs and down: 1
year nobody expects: 1
friend of albus: 1
it came down: 1
it was a: 1
is also possible: 1
much rage he: 1
his curiosity was: 1
wouldn't hurt one: 1
blaise knew about: 1
been obvious even: 1
potter harry tore: 1
looking for the: 1
possibly require this: 1
and then start: 1
to be sane: 1
clear cold voice: 1
with adult style: 1
black hat tilted: 1
the people shall: 1
but the thought: 1
and dumbledore the: 1
a better form: 1
in a tie: 1
allowances for the: 1
had not grown: 1
face your war: 1
with the dark: 1
scores but then: 1
old yes she: 1
wide does the: 1
battle magic again: 1
feel guilty it: 1
took into your: 1
if you are: 1
age was a: 1
and you'll still: 1
better form of: 1
people shall follow: 1
and then said: 1
away said hermione: 1
promised you is: 1
dark lord by: 1
dumbledore being involved: 1
seem to think: 1
and let draco: 1
ago being the: 1
only professors who'd: 1
the headmaster did: 1
after he heard: 1
a retired movie: 1
magical allele just: 1
that was well: 1
i won't keep: 1
promise him that: 1
is a person: 1
the figure beneath: 1
worried or uncomfortable: 1
that held any: 1
is giving you: 1
idiot to trust: 1
voice perhaps they: 1
of a second: 1
the forest obscured: 1
the headmaster asking: 1
i'm your friend: 1
asked mum that: 1
helping kimberly the: 1
make allowances for: 1
me i just: 1
would like me: 1
he and granger: 1
look to our: 1
professor mcgonagall's homework: 1
guilty it wasn't: 1
that was an: 1
time professor quirrell: 1
what happened to: 1
first year nobody: 1
with his mouth: 1
to make professor: 1
own face you: 1
but he is: 1
- hermione granger: 1
it probably is: 1
think i'm -: 1
that to the: 1
you this christmas: 1
potter they would: 1
he said that: 1
form of government: 1
this but if: 1
is the lesson: 1
let out a: 1
the way you: 1
of invisibility off: 1
through his hair: 1
a girl in: 1
blaise swallowed hard: 1
cannot find a: 1
a single point: 1
- so the: 1
knew the kind: 1
hands forcing a: 1
the one behind: 1
are ever worried: 1
it's been moved: 1
little slytherin if: 1
what will all: 1

for any other: 1
that hermione granger: 1
harry was very: 1

that's why you: 1
ask harry potter: 1

draco's fingers were: 1
voters that they: 1

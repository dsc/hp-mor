they were in: 1
harry drew a: 1
even granger and: 1
and then it: 1
dumbledore's booming voice: 1
beaten but threats: 1
do you two: 1
father lord malfoy: 1
clear soon enough: 1
raised by muggles: 1
at the audience: 1
resulted professor quirrell: 1
confused silence you: 1
obvious allies but: 1
and know this: 1
to remind them: 1
professor quirrell spoke: 1
simply to impose: 1
had written their: 1
marched against another: 1
another your parents: 1
solve all our: 1
did nothing to: 1
me that mr: 1
the command was: 1
three envelopes containing: 1
salvation he-who-must-not-be-named may: 1
up in a: 1
enemy rose against: 1
to institute a: 1
a temporary structure: 1
traitorous voice that: 1
a moment earlier: 1
granger's eyes flicked: 1
and draco realized: 1
knew that once: 1
slack or incompetence: 1
breach of their: 1
glances with granger: 1
too little to: 1
the many small: 1
merely puzzled now: 1
that she took: 1
have learned to: 1
tell me what: 1
a long pause: 1
haloed in ravenclaw's: 1
air or maybe: 1
recommendation my students: 1
boy who faced: 1
and called it: 1
face now stern: 1
decline of wizardry: 1
even thought about: 1
again being amplified: 1
quite enough to: 1
own family is: 1
learned they have: 1
to take advantage: 1
to crystallize a: 1
an entire country: 1
history of the: 1
students sat down: 1
not there was: 1
and not a: 1
crush you said: 1
see the next: 1
the possible mr: 1
draco stood in: 1
battlefield there was: 1
ascend three children: 1
will not deduct: 1
blaise zabini had: 1
encouraged greatly by: 1

of them but: 1
another pause harry: 1
time she had: 1
platinum and emeralds: 1
and then turned: 1
to try and: 1
i have no: 1
what is fair: 1
amplified if you: 1
practically a mudblood: 1
not threaten them: 1
day for i: 1
hadn't fallen into: 1
himself off you're: 1
dark lord in: 1
soak in -: 1
she said nothing: 1
stage really was: 1
or even granger: 1
had proven himself: 1
not too much: 1
granger and those: 1
quirrell but you: 1
listened not daring: 1
common enemy do: 1
them have lost: 1
if you're divided: 1
unified within itself: 1
won't it draco: 1
up at their: 1
agree with you: 1
teachers and she: 1
potter wishes for: 1
generals do the: 1
like he was: 1
hundred voices in: 1
aren't always enough: 1
a lord strong: 1
turned his head: 1
all of slytherin: 1
the lake and: 1
you no recommendation: 1
defense professor paused: 1
but the problem: 1
and he used: 1
united facing a: 1
speeches are not: 1
of all gems: 1
students of hogwarts: 1
shall be quite: 1
granger beside him: 1
deliberately of course: 1
for when the: 1
that you must: 1
already thought of: 1

applauding warmly and: 1
dismayed the headmaster: 1

doing it -: 1
conjure the grand: 1
dissatisfaction by supporting: 1
enough for me: 1
saying no word: 1

could never change: 1
they wish to: 1
the enemy will: 1
moment when the: 1
wait for professors: 1
in an instant: 1
attacking your enemy: 1
the envelopes well: 1
awe professor quirrell's: 1
was a confused: 1
divided land one: 1
might have worked: 1
something about architecture: 1
will have to: 1
is still fragmented: 1
can be manipulated: 1
professor quirrell and: 1
an embarrassed look: 1
tapped a cheek: 1
of slytherin had: 1
went on do: 1
but i say: 1
it would make: 1
the whole game: 1
any guide at: 1
to just buy: 1
word as yet: 1
wishes were directly: 1
what zabini had: 1
about that when: 1
you and for: 1
which one whole: 1
hufflepuff surely it: 1
themselves anti-malfoy a: 1
father probably wasn't: 1
knew what would: 1
been 254 to: 1
please be kind: 1
enjoyed the few: 1
son of lucius: 1
harry's hands -: 1
them alongside our: 1
learned nothing the: 1
yermy wibble knew: 1
all agree on: 1
professor quirrell opened: 1
contempt a dramatist: 1
hundred who thought: 1
to him he: 1
the edge of: 1
had decided not: 1
indeed there was: 1
the riot had: 1
his voice now: 1
any slack or: 1
i meant to: 1
that he'd done: 1
lake and that: 1
silence was instant: 1
thing draco turned: 1
for slytherin to: 1
is long since: 1
them to act: 1
hours minerva ordinarily: 1
invention that made: 1
have lost family: 1
generation did too: 1
miss granger draco: 1
the boy-who-lived take: 1
envelope your wish: 1
vulnerable in one: 1
be haloed in: 1
moment so fast: 1
his adopted family: 1
and perhaps fifty: 1
you could rely: 1
his voice general: 1
now how it: 1
give us a: 1
you try to: 1
simple i will: 1
face maybe i'll: 1
our lives every: 1
hufflepuff created the: 1
none could escape: 1
smiling it took: 1
wished only to: 1
mood had rapidly: 1
shot a glance: 1
and if all: 1
home and enjoy: 1
rapid glances -: 1
of surprise from: 1
was a puzzled: 1
muggles he was: 1
of the world: 1
rang forth like: 1
fewer and fewer: 1
eyes of headmaster: 1
than the slow: 1
think my father: 1
unify themselves not: 1
godric gryffindor and: 1
look at professor: 1
fell mr potter: 1
was a frown: 1
the podium to: 1
believed that harry: 1
disease - mr: 1
now stern saying: 1
breath there were: 1
dreadful feeling of: 1
be unified then: 1
- you mean: 1
dumbledore in a: 1
the secrets they: 1
his seat his: 1
me to join: 1
defense professor's voice: 1
for me to: 1
resume in the: 1
of their loyalty: 1
of unity but: 1
clapped and cheered: 1
coming up with: 1
you see i: 1
is for ravenclaw: 1
malfoy said professor: 1
on this occasion: 1
off you're a: 1
in ravenclaw or: 1
subtly motioned her: 1
she had the: 1
wizardry or that: 1
hand i shall: 1
a moment i'm: 1
draco raised his: 1
the most terrible: 1
mistake said professor: 1
before you this: 1
own behalf time: 1
potter whose fists: 1
students who would: 1
was the sound: 1
country marched against: 1
the generals no: 1
that two of: 1
take all of: 1
called themselves anti-malfoy: 1
then the follies: 1
i can't do: 1
lucius malfoy will: 1
cheered for dragon: 1
the power of: 1
the sheet of: 1
foe more numerous: 1
then something else: 1
professor quirrell this: 1
as i such: 1
hermione granger the: 1
stumbling over a: 1
if everyone is: 1
it a throne: 1
one level of: 1
well whatever his: 1
of them while: 1
cowards and do: 1
now they still: 1
a gigantic spout: 1
did and was: 1
as possible i: 1
years old well: 1
next time yes: 1
simply done it: 1
and visual style: 1
malfoy said granger: 1
the tiniest bit: 1
the few occasions: 1
the envelopes in: 1
you do in: 1
air of detached: 1
impossible - and: 1
finally harry potter: 1
you too failed: 1
have to do: 1
his right hand: 1
for one brief: 1
just do what: 1
rule strong enough: 1
consequences of their: 1
that the students: 1
completely with general: 1
draco that moon-traveling: 1
so fast that: 1
draco's jaw dropped: 1
over a memorized: 1
i will obey: 1
the stage really: 1
repeat then the: 1
snapped harry potter: 1
to act in: 1
it happened you: 1
hear what the: 1
the final score: 1
people only do: 1
things to try: 1
least he wished: 1
amplified but you: 1
families or what's: 1
thought about that: 1
to speak again: 1
stop them and: 1
surprised to see: 1
strength and though: 1
strategies more complicated: 1
up as the: 1
power as wizards: 1
fury and unbearable: 1
there was silence: 1
were gasps mostly: 1
malfoy himself will: 1
amused grin and: 1
snape and won: 1
at just one: 1
containing the three: 1
being impressed by: 1
this and mark: 1
was another pause: 1
will make clear: 1
zabini had done: 1
house that's why: 1
that you are: 1
not grant that: 1
their methods he: 1
lord perished lucius: 1
the cure might: 1
as his voice: 1
thousand questions and: 1
is good for: 1
day's entertainment but: 1
moment for this: 1
and with a: 1
trying to be: 1
one simple invention: 1
he can take: 1
the results so: 1
was feeling a: 1
wryly and some: 1
same war twice: 1
of those too: 1
had applied their: 1
he said them: 1
for a gryffindor: 1
wondering look in: 1
old well said: 1
malfoy did not: 1
to mark that: 1
you know the: 1
may i -: 1
by the power: 1
done he needed: 1
will claim that: 1
half a hundred: 1
be best if: 1
that draco thought: 1
thing as draco: 1
there was another: 1
called it a: 1
dark lord perished: 1
last a few: 1
future mr malfoy: 1
grasp once they: 1
about that mr: 1
mild voice of: 1
thinking the same: 1
really was well: 1
said them but: 1
when there are: 1
lives every day: 1
britain yermy wibble: 1
earlier flattery was: 1
stuffed chair in: 1
more complicated than: 1
a susurration of: 1
and a daze: 1
hogwarts but the: 1
artistry and the: 1
ancient house of: 1
funeral pyre there: 1
riot in front: 1
and all the: 1
to trust in: 1
me to mark: 1
of lucius scion: 1
letter to lucius: 1
potter harry potter: 1
on my own: 1
professor paused deliberately: 1
both your armies: 1
to accept traitors: 1
lord had lived: 1
own face there: 1
if you are: 1
people laughed but: 1
against that backdrop: 1
nothing more oh: 1
on doing nothing: 1
is not so: 1
professor quirrell wore: 1
logically impossible -: 1
the obvious place: 1
after the astounded: 1
it is good: 1
that the cure: 1
well as i: 1
took a deep: 1
have a wish: 1
down again very: 1
defeat the enemy: 1
against the crowd: 1
not even i: 1
say what threat: 1
didn't help that: 1
harry's chaotics looked: 1
another wish if: 1
they knew that: 1
smile then announce: 1
who wished only: 1
faint glitter of: 1
quirrell's eyes were: 1
and tore open: 1
the obvious implication: 1
people fear traitors: 1
death eaters who: 1
a while that: 1
gaze at where: 1
of the game: 1
him haloed in: 1
than uniting your: 1
armies we will: 1
once again being: 1
whole country opposing: 1
unity is strength: 1
faded into a: 1
and said nothing: 1
on a wish: 1
you saw it: 1
and dismayed the: 1
it was at: 1
released itself draco's: 1
watching students would: 1
who had covered: 1
quirrell opened the: 1
cure might be: 1
war people didn't: 1
the game no: 1
fallen into the: 1
will and sometimes: 1
then it seemed: 1
any other generals: 1
incompatible it's logically: 1
audience including a: 1
few dozen attackers: 1
so i make: 1
of horror as: 1
between grindelwald and: 1
may not have: 1
accepted traitors from: 1
did not ask: 1
possible mr potter: 1
boy-who-lived has to: 1
not deduct quirrell: 1
the boy-who-lived has: 1
point harry potter's: 1
nodded as though: 1
the face of: 1
divided you're vulnerable: 1
the evil general: 1
truthfully mr potter: 1
and on the: 1
houses of hogwarts: 1
in your ability: 1
or otherwise draco: 1
chuckle from draco: 1
all our lives: 1
stern saying no: 1
stupid the rules: 1
muggleborns the students: 1
brightest academic star: 1
wishes for -: 1
but you are: 1
on the faces: 1
iron and know: 1
started the riot: 1
a daze of: 1
cheek looking thoughtful: 1
back in kind: 1
himself too weak: 1
draco tried with: 1
indeed i planned: 1
not to spoil: 1
about the dangers: 1
moment earlier flattery: 1
speech i wanted: 1
not so i: 1
done the work: 1
he-who-must-not-be-named may not: 1
quirrell stood there: 1
there is a: 1
they listened not: 1
do what draco: 1
you what lesson: 1
straightened at the: 1
stands to reason: 1
defense professor this: 1
grin and what: 1
ridiculous there are: 1
a surprise coming: 1
tearing envelope your: 1
professor quirrell slowly: 1
still count for: 1
be a lie: 1
speak on my: 1
that we will: 1
it they would: 1
directly opposed -: 1
the students sat: 1
and you-know-who do: 1
about why mr: 1
knowing it was: 1
fury and frustration: 1
have called themselves: 1
was laughing without: 1
part of the: 1
slytherin - i: 1
is doing it: 1
our own power: 1
his head to: 1
this day about: 1
of history is: 1
silence went on: 1
formal voice knowing: 1
professors dryly then: 1
others indeed i: 1
still came as: 1
do please be: 1
but the very: 1
ahead and defeat: 1
the headmaster rose: 1
happen to him: 1
toward which quirrell: 1
at the dark: 1
what if he: 1
quirrell in the: 1
he looked considering: 1
- yes go: 1
notice just because: 1
were just having: 1
general granger and: 1
robes looked merely: 1
even from some: 1
actually defeat the: 1
and salazar slytherin: 1
i'm proud to: 1
refuses what if: 1
you this day: 1
there smiling wryly: 1
harry potter's voice: 1
- mr potter: 1
were still damp: 1
harry said still: 1
in front of: 1
spoke again his: 1
factions would be: 1
needed to last: 1
use it against: 1
just buy a: 1
further speeches if: 1
enough to rule: 1
were shattered in: 1
either of us: 1
create the one: 1
for something too: 1
stretched for a: 1
stress pressed down: 1
amplified and heard: 1
i'll just do: 1
the past history: 1
students would see: 1
was not how: 1
but when you: 1
understand there was: 1
had done the: 1
structure the makers: 1
who were mad: 1
save them there: 1
not like them: 1
and if some: 1
envelope beside draco: 1
december air or: 1
insect and all: 1
without any change: 1
quirrell there is: 1
marble inlaid with: 1
whoever's in their: 1
and i don't: 1
boy who had: 1
glance filled at: 1
potter everything the: 1
harry potter whose: 1
again and was: 1
the astounded silence: 1
sat down again: 1
boy-who-lived take that: 1
draco said coldly: 1
wood but the: 1
enjoyed the many: 1
share draco blinked: 1
and applauding warmly: 1
you long enough: 1
behalf time will: 1
for professors to: 1
like weight upon: 1
audience yes professor: 1
now there'd been: 1
thought she was: 1
fragmented and weak: 1
is nothing for: 1
professor smiling it: 1
the parchment then: 1
an instant they: 1
malfoy's fists were: 1
amusement dropped away: 1
he wouldn't ban: 1
scion of the: 1
to think that: 1
granger played that: 1
but it was: 1
draco realized as: 1

a hundred voices: 1
when it is: 1
parents' generation did: 1
lord in history: 1
granger said dumbledore's: 1
strategy today against: 1
and though lucius: 1
the same war: 1
i don't mean: 1
or that father: 1
in his speech: 1
distrust and confusion: 1
mark then they: 1
the peril as: 1
petty bickering and: 1
what i can't: 1
it's one of: 1
to see it: 1
while they still: 1
chaos harry said: 1
congratulated on having: 1
with gems of: 1
reason that what: 1
still live my: 1
alive how quickly: 1
neither of us: 1
be part of: 1
longer be heard: 1

you and lest: 1
could the defense: 1
angrier mr potter: 1
not say what: 1
the chaos legion: 1
us all -: 1
pause from the: 1
as well as: 1
go home and: 1
laughing without pause: 1
brief dry smile: 1
act together but: 1
professor quirrell his: 1
dark or otherwise: 1
see what students: 1
the rules are: 1
empty skins inspired: 1
rose against us: 1
today against sunshine: 1
appeared calm though: 1
had proven foolish: 1
and fewer aurors: 1
my own wish: 1
enemy and if: 1
that is beyond: 1
speeches if you: 1
is any guide: 1
suppose you are: 1
that the warming: 1
the most distrust: 1
country opposing them: 1
spies we'll ban: 1
for him said: 1
together to beat: 1
quirked up in: 1
wrong your parents': 1
screamed a hundred: 1
a vast funeral: 1
opulence but this: 1
of wealth and: 1
make the world: 1
dumbledore and on: 1
born - enough: 1
the explosion might've: 1
those armies could: 1
glitter and called: 1
a pause as: 1
more pathetic but: 1
forces to crush: 1
the follies of: 1
against another your: 1
that point harry: 1
do because everyone: 1
words finished leaving: 1
agreed to take: 1
how i expected: 1
conjuration only needed: 1
their arts their: 1
to symbolize the: 1
professor quirrell's eyes: 1
escape the dark: 1
their wishes as: 1
potter spoke his: 1
do it every: 1
the soldiers they: 1
dropped the snitch: 1
of fire blasted: 1
is a way: 1
are you trying: 1
parchment burst into: 1
write a letter: 1
never fight the: 1
make up for: 1
emeralds and granger: 1
many small chances: 1
said harry we: 1
others would already: 1
to move you: 1
flicked briefly toward: 1
podium his voice: 1
also costs them: 1
houses should still: 1
three children and: 1
the three generals: 1
its core sturdy: 1
mark of britain: 1
was nervous at: 1
long since dead: 1
follies of your: 1
ask do you: 1
there were anti-malfoy: 1
damaging than what: 1
breath i didn't: 1
zabini and write: 1
standing up and: 1
the battlefield shot: 1
granger the brightest: 1
longer amplified but: 1
are just a: 1
game said harry: 1
your wish somehow: 1
one whole country: 1
he saw that: 1
dumbledore stood in: 1
the makers hadn't: 1
but now it: 1
green-trimmed robes looked: 1
this day if: 1
and enjoy your: 1
my intended lesson: 1
again his voice: 1
but now if: 1
them there was: 1
he'd just backed: 1
lesson they have: 1
took his mark: 1
daze of horror: 1
so my own: 1
if you can't: 1
although first there: 1
potter i expected: 1
and over in: 1
draco turned from: 1
even harry's chaotics: 1
them but the: 1
doubt of it: 1
against half a: 1
the speechless silence: 1
had covered a: 1
front of the: 1
at stopping wars: 1
thought he might: 1
of the highest: 1
your will and: 1
same mistake next: 1
against them alongside: 1
thought of another: 1
face truthfully mr: 1
will try to: 1
no recommendation but: 1
earn their salvation: 1
intense fire that: 1
professor quirrell sounding: 1
or less without: 1
the words as: 1
have enjoyed the: 1
the dreadful pressure: 1
said in his: 1
battle we find: 1
be united facing: 1
have something they: 1
the future as: 1
to the possible: 1
been the better: 1
to be part: 1
the tension released: 1
there were many: 1
controlled the anger: 1
against a country: 1
yes professor said: 1
draco turned back: 1
he thinks about: 1
face him the: 1
a rather intrigued: 1
sunshine and dragon: 1
professor quirrell after: 1
was pathetic and: 1
afraid of traitors: 1
covered a stuffed: 1
your parents faced: 1
professor i do: 1
suddenly cutting the: 1
granger then to: 1
believe it this: 1
did that it: 1
this too will: 1
off the battlefield: 1
were a greater: 1
nothing while they: 1
quirrell slowly turned: 1
that ever harry: 1
no more traitors: 1
they'll understand there: 1
country to hold: 1
especially in slytherin: 1
few decades passed: 1
to himself and: 1
watching students truthfully: 1
were astonished murmurs: 1
quirrell his voice: 1
a tearing envelope: 1
like to hear: 1
cared for nothing: 1
without even meaning: 1
lord's grasp once: 1
about architecture and: 1
traitors see you: 1
just having fun: 1
over a living: 1
for that it: 1
hope said professor: 1
enough but you: 1
and that the: 1
laid out before: 1
who had expressed: 1
better now there'd: 1
hand closed into: 1
peace not if: 1
the very act: 1
but at least: 1
i completely agree: 1
looked at the: 1
to take that: 1
that cared for: 1
points on this: 1
as much direct: 1
on harry's part: 1
obvious place for: 1
they have been: 1
tried simply to: 1
wishes as all: 1
finally professor quirrell: 1
on granger's face: 1
to tell me: 1
on whoever's in: 1
it didn't help: 1
to riot in: 1
a lovely thing: 1
the words earlier: 1
when the dark: 1
your lives in: 1
cold as december: 1
parents would have: 1
also allowed to: 1
think it will: 1
quirrell with a: 1
claim that you: 1
with glitter of: 1
they're breaking the: 1
in the wrong: 1
to slight any: 1
honorable and pure: 1
cheered and went: 1
the outer surfaces: 1
not how i: 1
of the tension: 1
and rowena ravenclaw: 1
were mad who: 1
and take the: 1
consider whether there: 1
the result clever: 1
she nor the: 1
land one dark: 1
those three envelopes: 1
the headmaster and: 1
own grave but: 1
highest tower of: 1
fear traitors because: 1
dozen attackers and: 1
explosive mood had: 1
and awe professor: 1
it no more: 1
things you don't: 1
stood there smiling: 1
opposed him were: 1
do in the: 1
they took it: 1
of acting together: 1
the silence was: 1
a little speech: 1
then announce that: 1
there were soldiers: 1
had lived to: 1
to hold it: 1
is also allowed: 1
laughed but not: 1
half-expecting the words: 1
he ask for: 1
bleak and hard: 1
said draco they're: 1
was surprised to: 1
the shock was: 1
that people should: 1
slytherins they'll understand: 1
hush from the: 1
and she said: 1
to scatter the: 1
to say so: 1
serve and professor: 1
potter's gaze moved: 1
way for you: 1
three wishes using: 1
envelopes containing the: 1
than what a: 1
with it that: 1
professor quirrell was: 1
went home having: 1
- the stage: 1
motioned her would: 1
granger before you: 1
your parents could: 1
large transfigurations she: 1
and mark it: 1
costs and the: 1
at malice at: 1
in different armies: 1
you're a few: 1
wishes using a: 1
not for being: 1
pathetic and if: 1
any founder of: 1
the same rules: 1
defense professor's eyes: 1
speak again and: 1
was a lovely: 1
professor quirrell prepared: 1
house that's eight: 1
puzzled now it: 1
crowd as professor: 1
you have to: 1
in my army: 1
quirrell had awakened: 1
wasn't going to: 1
enough to save: 1
the consequences of: 1
then they could: 1
my traitors to: 1
it appears to: 1
a stupid move: 1
all your lives: 1
potter your will: 1
wouldn't ban spies: 1
no longer be: 1
her own grave: 1
as wizards but: 1
act together and: 1
to solve all: 1
allowed to be: 1
slight titter of: 1
lucius malfoy who: 1
will no longer: 1
should play quidditch: 1
did not there: 1
could crush any: 1
have imagined it: 1
break you up: 1
taken aback granger's: 1
to walk off: 1
now professor quirrell: 1
do not ask: 1
plan - the: 1
apologize for that: 1
obey you headmaster: 1
minerva was feeling: 1
but there are: 1
quirrell but there: 1
the first place: 1
him the most: 1
quirrell leaned forward: 1
and your parents: 1
or perish that: 1
and draco shot: 1
one there was: 1
their day's entertainment: 1
crossed harry potter's: 1
has accepted traitors: 1
and regret the: 1
crowd his customary: 1
memorized speech i: 1
happens when people: 1
you cannot throw: 1
which makes your: 1
was leaning upon: 1
many harry potter's: 1
clever betrayals until: 1
once and i'll: 1
he tapped a: 1
podium and took: 1
do not like: 1
game well um: 1
and draco raised: 1
coming harry potter: 1
and for one: 1
not live all: 1
i planned my: 1
ears of adults: 1
getting angrier mr: 1
had already been: 1
in history your: 1
only to make: 1
and we'll crush: 1
be thinking the: 1
it it might: 1
say that she: 1
too much this: 1
being saved by: 1
at where albus: 1
aside your petty: 1
future as you: 1
will be a: 1
looked up from: 1
he has more: 1
like she thought: 1
pitfall of being: 1
stage draco heard: 1
to make the: 1
you-know-who would have: 1
to unify themselves: 1
were to find: 1
many of them: 1
those incredibly stupid: 1
can it's exactly: 1
knowing that it: 1
students in the: 1
a foe that: 1
him to say: 1
a mudblood himself: 1
possible i told: 1
meant to say: 1
do ends up: 1
do that the: 1
in his cruelty: 1
own illusion of: 1
at all then: 1
to reason that: 1
three parchments upon: 1
professor his voice: 1
traitors do might: 1
didn't tell my: 1
by the words: 1
who saves you: 1
in the first: 1
then to draco: 1
threat in your: 1
that slytherin meant: 1
few occasions when: 1
and dragon i: 1
it for others: 1
dorm-mates in ravenclaw: 1
a moment for: 1
envelopes well said: 1
his voice suddenly: 1
wizardry their eyes: 1
points unfairly said: 1
that was unified: 1
comes i can: 1
draco wasn't looking: 1
dragon i didn't: 1
glitter of marble: 1
said he wouldn't: 1
if father did: 1
enemy is also: 1
potter's voice could: 1
confine yourself to: 1
just because you: 1
not ask me: 1
the same thing: 1
about that harry: 1
common foe harry: 1
- enough bellowed: 1
it seemed to: 1
as though to: 1
a greater threat: 1
ran through the: 1
spoke people fear: 1
white there were: 1
in green-trimmed robes: 1
have to say: 1
to stand the: 1
earlier but now: 1
on large transfigurations: 1
you are simply: 1
and fury and: 1
the traitors up: 1
core sturdy wood: 1
the stage waiting: 1
traitors also costs: 1
no mistake said: 1
you think my: 1
and the problem: 1
more or less: 1
the voice of: 1
from being fished: 1
that's why godric: 1
smart if you're: 1
than it had: 1
hogwarts watched and: 1
said granger sounding: 1
wasn't looking at: 1
little better now: 1
right now professor: 1
parents faced one: 1
hope is to: 1
would be encouraged: 1
harry we have: 1
granger draco said: 1
mostly from muggleborns: 1
a grim intensity: 1
and make the: 1
sunshine you did: 1
foe that cared: 1
mouth that he'd: 1
take this country: 1
dei ex machina: 1
world a vast: 1
but tried simply: 1
not have deserved: 1
not quite have: 1
only important thing: 1
public if harry: 1
pressed down like: 1
were glaring at: 1
shock draco exchanged: 1
seen three armies: 1
proud to be: 1
he did and: 1
inspired nothing but: 1
his own face: 1
a slytherin to: 1
proven himself too: 1
nothing professor quirrell: 1
total make no: 1
your parents will: 1
have no common: 1
people should always: 1
heard the defense: 1
took it they: 1
mark it well: 1
to say about: 1
defense professor gazed: 1
grindelwald and you-know-who: 1
still happy to: 1
than either of: 1
of those armies: 1
malfoy and beside: 1
whole watching crowd: 1
mudblood himself he: 1
frustration it didn't: 1
if he refuses: 1
just backed his: 1
perhaps i could: 1
professor claimed to: 1
of thousands that: 1
people do because: 1
students said albus: 1
incompetence there was: 1
black dust sprinkling: 1
his own father: 1
they still live: 1
much this whole: 1
see what he: 1
of sunshine and: 1
needed to remind: 1
in the speechless: 1
his death would: 1
flatly from beside: 1
both on your: 1
undertone i suppose: 1
was unified within: 1
said that inner: 1
quietly and no: 1
tickled at the: 1
he-who-must-not-be-named wished to: 1
drew forth the: 1
it - but: 1
i shall be: 1
you never fight: 1
most costly things: 1
for you to: 1
in ravenclaw how: 1
did not quite: 1
fled like whipped: 1
it i suggest: 1
difficult enough to: 1
live all your: 1
pause harry standing: 1
with evident showmanship: 1
other students gazed: 1
to lucius malfoy: 1
do hope said: 1
dark lord like: 1
on his own: 1
opposed - you: 1
the utter silence: 1
weak then said: 1
all gems with: 1
being amplified if: 1
glanced at the: 1
build as professor: 1
their mood that's: 1
death eaters would: 1
to be congratulated: 1
rose from his: 1
was a pause: 1
malfoy and malfoy: 1
dark lord but: 1
daring to move: 1
is simple i: 1
to propose a: 1
implication professor quirrell: 1
malfoy can work: 1
death eaters agreed: 1
and heard that: 1
was just their: 1
you won't it: 1
your parents deserved: 1
you to concede: 1
which quirrell now: 1
it was once: 1
ash there have: 1
not for the: 1
as cold now: 1
i could break: 1
even understood what: 1
now if father: 1
harry potter everything: 1
defeated by any: 1
deserved to lose: 1
then only a: 1
it said granger: 1
it was pretty: 1
his mark and: 1
good for a: 1
there were fewer: 1
do what is: 1
we will wipe: 1
last soldier left: 1
occasions when she: 1
mouth quirked up: 1
no longer accept: 1
to concede immediately: 1
own power as: 1
to all agree: 1
you miss granger: 1
of opulence but: 1
move you too: 1
that general chaos: 1
rely on whoever's: 1
of being impressed: 1
might perhaps have: 1
say so draco: 1
burned with a: 1
are simply wrong: 1
was a long: 1
will do said: 1
enemy to impose: 1
whatever it was: 1
them that the: 1
traitors because of: 1
an honest accident: 1
from the defense: 1
have learned something: 1
before occurred to: 1
them it stands: 1
crush any dark: 1
he's too weak: 1
rapid glances with: 1
they did not: 1

his mark then: 1
to look out: 1
himself will believe: 1
said in a: 1
in kind they: 1
had it no: 1
toward the watching: 1
low enough for: 1
spoke there were: 1
for the crisp: 1
meant by the: 1
are wiser do: 1
general malfoy said: 1
students gazed up: 1
see an embarrassed: 1
both like to: 1
follow him or: 1
was still whirling: 1
if the past: 1
professor his hand: 1
imagined it the: 1
been described by: 1
they were just: 1
bare of all: 1
that he'd just: 1
to a few: 1
this day's lesson: 1
you trying to: 1
potter harry potter's: 1
deduct quirrell points: 1
been if not: 1
wishes are mutually: 1
this day for: 1
of platinum and: 1
to build as: 1
soon enough that: 1
well done at: 1
it took a: 1
those wishes are: 1
quirrell sounding very: 1
harry gasped granger: 1
from doing it: 1
dangerously rising voice: 1
simplicity also has: 1
had been 254: 1
traded rapid glances: 1
laughter ran through: 1
known dumbledore could: 1
of malfoy can: 1
titter of laughter: 1
and pure and: 1
and dumbledore together: 1
what i will: 1
to the podium: 1
to unite then: 1
home having enjoyed: 1
he hadn't thought: 1
damp from being: 1
any request consider: 1
said miss granger: 1
burst into flames: 1
parchments upon which: 1
for a while: 1
of students said: 1
use traitors and: 1
the lesson of: 1
try and stop: 1
showmanship the defense: 1
do you understand: 1
do the most: 1
transfigurations she should: 1
well said the: 1
always enough general: 1
have to solve: 1
but minerva was: 1
with bewilderment and: 1
too will serve: 1
a plan -: 1
could survive there: 1
thunders draco hadn't: 1
say anything about: 1
if i could: 1
any traitors and: 1
mask and when: 1
students as they: 1
gasps from the: 1
you can't stop: 1
didn't act together: 1
edge of draco's: 1
sorry about that: 1
dry indeed there: 1
him off the: 1
i used that: 1
with a grim: 1
be interesting would: 1
already been standing: 1
kind they did: 1
within itself professor: 1
being amplified and: 1
most ancient house: 1
the nation is: 1
then you face: 1
fight the same: 1
nothing the nation: 1
of the audience: 1
three armies do: 1
kind to the: 1
feeling of digging: 1
shall see you: 1
only a united: 1
for wars it's: 1
grand stage toward: 1
professor quirrell they: 1
said but i: 1
would you like: 1
have to all: 1
rule over you: 1
you ask your: 1
for others indeed: 1
but threats aren't: 1
prepared another wish: 1
being hunted down: 1
you did not: 1
being irrelevant it: 1
done it at: 1
calm though draco: 1
mr potter your: 1
survive there were: 1
were not there: 1
harry potter visibly: 1
house were hexing: 1
quickly would they: 1
can't do mr: 1
a stuffed chair: 1
was at its: 1
and took up: 1
general chaos i: 1
no common enemy: 1
leaving his mouth: 1
and the final: 1
time yes that'll: 1
of dumbledore no: 1
at professor quirrell: 1
the three had: 1
himself and then: 1
written their wishes: 1
own wish to: 1
it was nervous: 1
would be united: 1
raised his voice: 1
upon a platinum: 1
of it your: 1
you won't and: 1
draco it was: 1
spoke his voice: 1
beside him hermione: 1
friends in ravenclaw: 1
i'm hermione granger: 1
i would both: 1
next threat in: 1
learned something this: 1
his customary air: 1
professor drew forth: 1
whole country marched: 1
say quietly and: 1
a falling mask: 1
you face other: 1
the better term: 1
other generals it: 1
without my help: 1
at least for: 1
malfoy meant slytherin: 1
voice say quietly: 1
even i can: 1
instant and total: 1
the future mr: 1
customary air of: 1
watched and waited: 1
the game simplicity: 1
dramatist would have: 1
silence you can't: 1
everyone needing to: 1
to make and: 1
the generals do: 1
but fear and: 1
lord's hand i: 1
and also your: 1
leaned forward at: 1
together but for: 1
good said their: 1
not unite the: 1
though draco was: 1
stupid things you: 1
then turned back: 1
decades passed between: 1
to cause as: 1
should like to: 1
was that people: 1
your parents nearly: 1
i can't win: 1
face there were: 1
minerva ordinarily enjoyed: 1
that had been: 1
sentiment which might: 1
through a thousand: 1
who dared face: 1
confidence in your: 1
mad who wished: 1
of them have: 1
the rules but: 1
of the headmaster: 1
punished by pain: 1
live my own: 1
that left only: 1
was showing on: 1
seemed to crystallize: 1
tension released itself: 1
voice knowing it: 1
the danger what: 1
and other costs: 1
either of our: 1
by what zabini: 1
strength the dark: 1
may expect to: 1
moment i'm not: 1
the obvious allies: 1
crowd with a: 1
though he did: 1
december you-know-who would: 1
miss granger have: 1
act of speaking: 1
in ravenclaw's sapphire: 1
that is all: 1
my students but: 1
greater threat than: 1
was a little: 1
he might have: 1
rises lucius malfoy: 1
unity but the: 1
have a surprise: 1
was instant and: 1
potter i would: 1
mood that's it: 1
as well draco: 1
possibly doubt that: 1
forth the parchment: 1
time you may: 1
seat his face: 1
hand stretched out: 1
go ahead -: 1
feeling a little: 1
do not wait: 1
each other just: 1
lucius malfoy did: 1
might have imagined: 1
history is that: 1
defense professor i: 1
into the usual: 1
and something tickled: 1
come said professor: 1
your people and: 1
there was some: 1
down snape and: 1
draco harry potter: 1
damage as possible: 1
did not unite: 1
could not threaten: 1
the full fifty: 1
potter does we: 1
that seemed to: 1
and then professor: 1
as all the: 1
change of expression: 1
and hermione granger: 1
unite in the: 1
dead at the: 1
take that terrible: 1
ended around fifteen: 1
right hand stretched: 1
called that a: 1
already be thinking: 1
while that was: 1
failed this country: 1
forward at the: 1
enough that this: 1
to soak in: 1
might be less: 1
important thing was: 1
people didn't act: 1
draco looked rather: 1
world could not: 1
the last war: 1
exchanged rapid glances: 1
you two intend: 1
i allowed traitors: 1
expected that particular: 1
rather intrigued expression: 1
obnoxious most certainly: 1
he hadn't even: 1
face other risks: 1
you-know-who do you: 1
to find a: 1
ends up being: 1
slight any of: 1
be even more: 1
a sharp tone: 1
dry voice of: 1
or what's left: 1
and draco son: 1
i won't make: 1
the eyes of: 1
the whole watching: 1
destruction this i: 1
accordingly mr potter: 1
going against the: 1
speech accordingly mr: 1
shot himself in: 1
well said professor: 1
deserved to win: 1
its future and: 1
beyond ridiculous there: 1
and anger and: 1
ban spies we'll: 1
would be impossible: 1
that you ask: 1
as the defense: 1
more traitors i: 1
puzzled pause from: 1
mark that incompetence: 1
do about it: 1
completely agree with: 1
only promised one: 1
against his adopted: 1
were many speeches: 1
such speeches are: 1
to accomplish it: 1
renewed hush from: 1
a break blaise: 1
their despicable cowardice: 1
not there to: 1
had inscribed their: 1
from muggleborns the: 1
dumbledore there was: 1
an insect and: 1
blasted out of: 1
the explosive mood: 1
of our divided: 1
then indeed you: 1
a few hours: 1
it's exactly the: 1
had started the: 1
other lucius malfoy: 1
because the riot: 1
nothing about traitors: 1
same house were: 1
the clouds but: 1
single leader then: 1
army and i: 1
would have to: 1
would both like: 1
in which the: 1
why godric gryffindor: 1
potter's gaze went: 1
and studded with: 1
the world is: 1
coordinating using the: 1
to the dark: 1
tone like she: 1
i didn't tell: 1
how quickly would: 1
knowing that any: 1
do this day: 1
would make overwhelmingly: 1
if a whole: 1
threat will come: 1
indeed you might: 1
quirrell nodded as: 1
problem of acting: 1
showing on his: 1
wars a few: 1
calmly i won't: 1
cannot possibly doubt: 1
of the noble: 1
threat than the: 1
against us in: 1
please confine yourself: 1
at the front: 1
away like a: 1
looked considering for: 1
see you on: 1
or the secrets: 1
shone with glitter: 1
it will be: 1
slytherin to win: 1
am skeptical that: 1
the costs of: 1
dared face him: 1
that the dark: 1
now as his: 1
quirrell prepared to: 1
speaking seemed to: 1
harry said flatly: 1
good measure their: 1
malfoy and miss: 1
entertainment but i: 1
were perfectly unified: 1
over and over: 1
what a whole: 1
darkness comes i: 1
what in merlin's: 1
you could never: 1
i shall see: 1
the fury of: 1
a sharp undertone: 1
who thought to: 1
something this day: 1
what lesson they: 1
house in my: 1
all when classes: 1
many speeches made: 1
not the tiniest: 1
speech i meant: 1
means to restrain: 1
i such speeches: 1
same rules and: 1
grades low enough: 1
have been described: 1
together had applied: 1
that it would: 1
lesson of history: 1
open the last: 1
dumbledore and he: 1
that easily draco: 1
cut himself off: 1
when you try: 1
quirrell the dark: 1
beside him her: 1
professor quirrell again: 1
dark lord's grasp: 1
most terrible dark: 1
institute a draft: 1
day about the: 1
incredibly stupid things: 1
to create the: 1
albus dumbledore there: 1
and granger traded: 1
has a great: 1
of extermination then: 1
will obey you: 1
knows their arts: 1
something else for: 1
doing it again: 1
did he ask: 1
flames and burned: 1
you mean said: 1
could grow into: 1
to earn their: 1
for being saved: 1
them i used: 1
children and straightened: 1
in peace not: 1
into the corner: 1
so the dark: 1
few people laughed: 1
no word as: 1
and spread division: 1
concede immediately and: 1
potter said calmly: 1
was well done: 1
it against them: 1
impossible for him: 1
professor's eyes flicked: 1
to address the: 1
is the enemy: 1
merlin's name did: 1
some students who: 1
what he thinks: 1
in his cruel: 1
in any battle: 1
was a renewed: 1
that mr potter: 1
worry said professor: 1
were clenched tight: 1
about traitors and: 1
inner voice it: 1
into a collective: 1
won't and we'll: 1
as he said: 1
your parents have: 1
difficult coming up: 1
your army granger's: 1
made no recommendation: 1
suggest that you: 1
yes go ahead: 1
the boy-who-lived or: 1
i - yes: 1
hadn't known dumbledore: 1
of hogwarts in: 1
alongside our own: 1
ravenclaw and i'm: 1
lords who were: 1
oh don't worry: 1
she was suddenly: 1
before then you: 1
draco hadn't even: 1
that'll be even: 1
whatever his other: 1
one cunning plot: 1
now it would: 1
about that but: 1
that then something: 1
of those wishes: 1
it stands to: 1
division is weakness: 1
i would speak: 1
rapidly faded into: 1
and burned with: 1
until the last: 1
lord took his: 1
including a chuckle: 1
lose the voice: 1
left on the: 1
think that he'd: 1
up and tore: 1
said coldly you: 1
were fewer and: 1
before that i'm: 1
quirrell wore an: 1
hard your parents: 1
by that point: 1
and then there: 1
of the dark: 1
then he and: 1
clear voice knowing: 1
to father probably: 1
you said draco: 1
intrigued expression on: 1
it was strange: 1
numerous than they: 1
i will go: 1
it i shall: 1
coldly you have: 1
they're slytherins they'll: 1
say about that: 1
there are just: 1
weak to stop: 1
regret the day: 1
with zabini and: 1
gasped granger looking: 1
only hope is: 1
you but tried: 1
said flatly from: 1
playing into harry's: 1
their own illusion: 1
it's logically impossible: 1
said calmly i: 1
a dei ex: 1
to its future: 1
and when he: 1
learned to hide: 1
a tight fist: 1
if you could: 1
crowd from against: 1
up and applauding: 1
work together but: 1
the stage draco: 1
and strength and: 1
look on granger's: 1
- he knows: 1
if he's too: 1
him the vigilantes: 1
walk off the: 1
professor gazed out: 1
almost fell mr: 1
mark and the: 1
been standing up: 1
command was clear: 1
save us all: 1
eight hundred years: 1
to dumbledore and: 1
that it had: 1
mind said the: 1
from his seat: 1
will not live: 1
him hermione granger: 1
well draco controlled: 1
first place i'm: 1
um said granger: 1
professor quirrell's voice: 1
fury of his: 1
it was harry: 1
riot had started: 1
dust sprinkling down: 1
fight against his: 1
weakness said the: 1
death would inspire: 1
then the defense: 1
can do that: 1
were gasps from: 1
never change the: 1
the headmaster was: 1
said draco malfoy: 1
your house and: 1
country alive how: 1
of albus dumbledore: 1
living country and: 1
way that would: 1
a wish oh: 1
about it snapped: 1
occasion but next: 1
accept traitors see: 1
do you and: 1
rising voice nor: 1
corner more or: 1
because you grew: 1
her high voice: 1
general chaos harry: 1
together and a: 1
do mr potter: 1
like iron and: 1
stupid then if: 1
cunning plot and: 1
otherwise draco malfoy's: 1
by a one-year-old: 1
direction of dumbledore: 1
the help of: 1
if harry had: 1
and cheered and: 1
potter has accepted: 1
quidditch without the: 1
was considerable laughter: 1
to say that: 1
damage the traitor: 1
i expected you: 1
make the same: 1
clever plots and: 1
great deal to: 1
ravenclaw to win: 1
because they're afraid: 1
what draco tried: 1
hold it in: 1
and professor quirrell: 1
time with your: 1
by death that: 1
mean said harry: 1
had expressed that: 1
people unite in: 1
the usual pitfall: 1
chances for artistry: 1
of those incredibly: 1
expected you to: 1
make clear soon: 1
created the four: 1
crystallize a plan: 1
off the stage: 1
i suggest that: 1
eyes were as: 1
looking absolutely aghast: 1
it in his: 1
people and attacking: 1
when draco glanced: 1
your enemy and: 1
gryffindor to have: 1
yourself to the: 1
learn this day's: 1
explosion might've come: 1
lord rose and: 1
experience than either: 1
that once they: 1
inscribed their wishes: 1
same thing as: 1
we find that: 1
family to the: 1
stage toward which: 1
help that they: 1
dumbledore i should: 1
in the faint: 1
dreadful pressure like: 1
voice general granger: 1
crowd as draco's: 1
squarely into the: 1
place for him: 1
to make mr: 1
of speaking seemed: 1
are not for: 1
parents could have: 1
surprise coming harry: 1
he'd mentioned harry: 1
who faced down: 1
matter how stupid: 1
the most costly: 1
even before that: 1
act in the: 1
and write a: 1
wrong direction is: 1
by their own: 1
and take his: 1
and those factions: 1
grant three wishes: 1
wonder if perhaps: 1
the snitch ruins: 1
what would happen: 1
does directly the: 1
of traitors also: 1
parchment then without: 1
be it mr: 1
sure controlled would: 1
adults as the: 1
few hours minerva: 1
less damaging than: 1
get draco had: 1
wanted to make: 1
themselves about that: 1
anti-malfoy a moment: 1
for miss granger: 1
of the danger: 1
hands - if: 1
louder than it: 1
amplified louder than: 1
watching students very: 1
were directly opposed: 1
hermione granger beside: 1
risks and other: 1
thinking at just: 1
war twice and: 1
with you but: 1
audience as well: 1
his voice mark: 1
something too it: 1
intend to do: 1
which might perhaps: 1
turned to look: 1
stop thinking at: 1
though it was: 1
could rely both: 1
he was playing: 1
the snitch what: 1
level the chaos: 1
we make the: 1
faces of the: 1
much direct damage: 1
by supporting the: 1
than the disease: 1
crushed by a: 1
should always be: 1
will serve and: 1
academic star of: 1
detached amusement dropped: 1
one harry potter: 1
upon which the: 1
firmly nodded well: 1
the disease -: 1
eyes and fury: 1
voice harry potter: 1
your own lifetimes: 1
parents deserved to: 1
award house points: 1
what people do: 1
help of any: 1
bickering and take: 1
ravenclaw or for: 1
defense professor drew: 1
have to be: 1
your armies -: 1
try to unite: 1
having thought of: 1
people should be: 1
students but i: 1
mark professor quirrell's: 1
slowly turned his: 1
family - he: 1
occasion to tire: 1
with general malfoy: 1
hogwarts to the: 1
to look at: 1
left only drifting: 1
it was being: 1
rule over a: 1
open and spread: 1
been wars in: 1
already said he: 1
was silence professor: 1
to restrain them: 1
and when draco: 1
ask me to: 1
gaze moved to: 1
come but dumbledore: 1
few traitors and: 1
a one-year-old boy: 1
no longer amplified: 1
went to granger: 1
this your parents: 1
like an insect: 1
a few years: 1
that all three: 1
the watching audience: 1
the battlefield draco: 1
results so clearly: 1
- the boy: 1
then harry cut: 1
all to its: 1
perfectly unified knowing: 1
do that harry: 1
- and then: 1
just shrugged sorry: 1
the slow decline: 1
no one dared: 1
anything about why: 1
for they did: 1
for slytherin -: 1
would have faced: 1
a draft though: 1
of another one: 1
accomplish it without: 1
them you saw: 1
were in different: 1
on do you: 1
a wry grin: 1
this whole country: 1
lesson is simple: 1
hexing each other: 1
where draco stood: 1
a gryffindor to: 1
it without my: 1
house color neither: 1
eaters would have: 1
will do when: 1
mean to slight: 1
to ask said: 1
their destruction this: 1
me what i: 1
made him the: 1
over in his: 1
in the eyes: 1
and his mouth: 1
audience especially in: 1

the students as: 1
eaters who were: 1
of your parents: 1

defense professor smiling: 1
headmaster and make: 1
of everyone needing: 1
but if everyone: 1
a leader as: 1
that resulted professor: 1
other costs and: 1
beside draco not: 1
quirrell points on: 1
a brief dry: 1
we will join: 1
in his most: 1

professor quirrell stood: 1
tell my traitors: 1

if you don't: 1
united magical world: 1
their loyalty would: 1
and weak how: 1
evident showmanship the: 1

in a war: 1
a little better: 1
her would be: 1

dark lord took: 1
dark lord rose: 1
even stranger the: 1

of professors dryly: 1
after a gigantic: 1

speeches made for: 1
a soundless stress: 1
seem quite enough: 1
they did nothing: 1
is for slytherin: 1
potter though you: 1
temporary structure the: 1
nation is still: 1
at him right: 1
beside draco looked: 1
the illusion of: 1
used that strategy: 1
was once again: 1
a single plot: 1
when classes resume: 1
were as cold: 1
was he did: 1
glitter of emeralds: 1
you what your: 1
of the damage: 1
enough bellowed albus: 1
voice knowing that: 1
had been if: 1
to hide like: 1
but do please: 1
adopted family -: 1
sturdy wood but: 1
will be done: 1
she said in: 1
fast that draco: 1
for - there: 1
you and regret: 1
we will no: 1
draco son of: 1
of darkness comes: 1
no matter how: 1
two intend to: 1
easily draco said: 1
like them my: 1
podium to address: 1
armies - not: 1
not if the: 1
draco hadn't known: 1
absolutely aghast and: 1
vast funeral pyre: 1
and the adults: 1
meant malfoy and: 1
star of hogwarts: 1
nothing for it: 1
mr malfoy and: 1
his family for: 1
voice firmed as: 1
will come said: 1
won whispered a: 1
said and said: 1
who were perfectly: 1
the words finished: 1
over this country: 1
the dark mark: 1
the students of: 1
also has a: 1
result clever plots: 1
not saying you're: 1
and for miss: 1
behind the stage: 1
it every time: 1
is enough and: 1
there'd been one: 1
played that game: 1
what threat will: 1
to join with: 1
and squaring those: 1
can't win against: 1
and that is: 1
said the dry: 1
a heap of: 1
accident but it: 1
into a lord: 1
say he has: 1
but houses should: 1
have been defeated: 1
complicated than uniting: 1
the podium his: 1
opposing them it: 1
as for harry: 1
conversation to go: 1
it seems like: 1
when the explosion: 1
who opposed him: 1
time will make: 1
agree on a: 1
thought granger played: 1
so be it: 1
in the name: 1
from against that: 1
and yes that: 1
all wondering what: 1
and clever betrayals: 1
you mr potter: 1
wish if i: 1
didn't seem quite: 1
could escape the: 1
when she had: 1
for i do: 1
ability to learn: 1

that what a: 1
just a few: 1

a slight titter: 1
quirrell the three: 1
i speak on: 1
of the muggles': 1
had rapidly faded: 1
a god blowing: 1
i shall have: 1
follies and he: 1
doing nothing about: 1
hadn't thought granger: 1
you are all: 1
voice was bleak: 1
me once and: 1
there were astonished: 1
saw it today: 1
tensed up as: 1
remind them that: 1
classes resume in: 1
the problem of: 1
the anger flushing: 1
nearly lost against: 1
be done the: 1
house of malfoy: 1
best if you: 1
traitors from either: 1
look like he: 1
threat rises lucius: 1
that would create: 1
hide like cowards: 1
are mutually incompatible: 1
score had been: 1
loyalty would be: 1
frowning and something: 1
that particular conversation: 1
and the illusion: 1
later after a: 1
the adults clapped: 1
thing was that: 1
saying that in: 1
whirling through a: 1
i can do: 1
work with the: 1
already turning to: 1
more experience than: 1
spread division is: 1
fist unity is: 1
have won the: 1
brief moment so: 1
albus dumbledore in: 1
skins inspired nothing: 1
quirrell looked at: 1
it might have: 1
defense professor claimed: 1
if we make: 1
not tie into: 1
have been dark: 1
grasp forever but: 1
the warming charms: 1
they would be: 1
on having thought: 1
of any traitors: 1
the damage the: 1
at the parchment: 1
winning there were: 1
to beat their: 1
be heard because: 1
unite then you: 1
fifteen seconds later: 1
power of the: 1
of a hundred: 1
that any breach: 1
seconds later after: 1
now filled with: 1
if general potter: 1

certainly not harry: 1
take the mark: 1
harry standing beside: 1
in your own: 1

that understanding to: 1
the general of: 1
not all of: 1

to my office: 1
heap of ash: 1
with granger they: 1
there is nothing: 1
even meaning to: 1
day of darkness: 1
the three children: 1
are all wondering: 1
wish to make: 1
the last envelope: 1
took the two: 1
- but by: 1
audience puzzlement and: 1
all of the: 1
that if a: 1
not wait for: 1
ravenclaw's sapphire as: 1
dark lord had: 1
traitors i completely: 1
was amplified louder: 1
carefully and quietly: 1
harry had been: 1
don't notice just: 1
army there were: 1
house points unfairly: 1
this to soak: 1
whole country does: 1
wiser do not: 1
do when the: 1
will you repeat: 1
lovely thing draco: 1
makes your wish: 1
wibble who called: 1
around fifteen seconds: 1
the corner more: 1
and strong neither: 1
dumbledore had already: 1
those factions would: 1
shaken what in: 1
in - in: 1
been the obvious: 1
have to apologize: 1
granger firmly nodded: 1
slytherin meant malfoy: 1
draco controlled the: 1
said the mild: 1
crowd and if: 1
chaos i agree: 1
ever harry potter: 1
professors to save: 1
aurors who dared: 1
gryffindor and salazar: 1
hogwarts in the: 1
phrase give us: 1
throw aside your: 1
teacher are you: 1
one way but: 1
defense professor had: 1
the crowd from: 1
to be you: 1
without pause so: 1
betrayals until the: 1
salazar slytherin and: 1
was harry potter: 1
him that had: 1
sounding like she: 1
wrong professor quirrell: 1
what he meant: 1
it at all: 1
the first person: 1
might wish that: 1
of a house: 1
allies but their: 1
using a single: 1
yes that'll be: 1
they tell but: 1
were tears in: 1
closed into a: 1
i already thought: 1
friends in hufflepuff: 1
hermione granger firmly: 1
you on the: 1
whole country were: 1
symbolize what happens: 1
for the mouths: 1
but even before: 1
by the phrase: 1
lives in peace: 1
shot himself you: 1
better term finally: 1
no said draco: 1
from some students: 1
three generals had: 1
him or perish: 1
they could crush: 1
harry potter turned: 1
you like to: 1
perish that your: 1
greatly by what: 1
understanding to create: 1
from the three: 1
to say he: 1
make you no: 1
but the conjuration: 1
were winning against: 1
every day if: 1
an interesting sentiment: 1
few years too: 1
drifting black dust: 1
could have fought: 1
manipulated by you: 1
lord was winning: 1
through him that: 1
no doubt of: 1
waited finally professor: 1
at all to: 1
himself you cannot: 1
made for the: 1
up with it: 1
change the game: 1
are still to: 1
nothing but their: 1
threaten them and: 1
hermione granger of: 1
and emeralds not: 1
enjoy your time: 1
that's eight hundred: 1
when people unite: 1
from the crowd: 1
lucius malfoy and: 1
to dissipate the: 1
voice clear and: 1
quirrell again and: 1
studded with gems: 1
parents will do: 1
nation to institute: 1
that backdrop of: 1
to say draco: 1
mr potter though: 1
tight and trembling: 1
well said miss: 1
soundless stress pressed: 1
voice it will: 1
to open the: 1
students and teachers: 1
sharp tone like: 1
i will do: 1
acting together isn't: 1
the podium and: 1
we'll ban them: 1
bellowed albus dumbledore: 1
in the same: 1
though to himself: 1
too it was: 1
draco said in: 1
that incompetence there: 1
and the utter: 1
announce that you: 1
his other follies: 1
blowing to scatter: 1
much to ask: 1
ravenclaw and helga: 1
only do because: 1
draco heard the: 1
done the defense: 1
traitors and gave: 1
looking at him: 1
quirrell that you: 1
anger flushing through: 1
nervous at first: 1
come to my: 1
a renewed hush: 1
to see an: 1
cannot throw aside: 1
to act together: 1
for dragon army: 1
words earlier but: 1
like this not: 1
chaos legion is: 1
entire country by: 1
players do ends: 1
to the traitors: 1
to spoil it: 1
hundred thunders draco: 1
this will be: 1
even that it: 1
lucius scion of: 1

nor the headmaster: 1
if some still: 1
eaters they were: 1

i've had it: 1
it was he: 1
intended lesson but: 1
name did he: 1
the parchment and: 1
weak how few: 1
would be best: 1
gaze went to: 1
to 254 behind: 1
slytherin and rowena: 1
far too much: 1
of it before: 1
and sometimes you: 1
malfoy who saves: 1
a hundred thunders: 1
said their defense: 1
having fun there: 1
on the face: 1
go on doing: 1
be worse than: 1
a throne -: 1
professor quirrell in: 1
draco not even: 1
own lifetimes will: 1
a wondering look: 1
least for a: 1
but their wishes: 1
well he-who-must-not-be-named wished: 1
through the crowd: 1
up for the: 1
not many harry: 1

quirrell looked up: 1
voice could no: 1
voice of albus: 1
commend it mr: 1
what if he's: 1
of hogwarts but: 1
draco exchanged rapid: 1
his students and: 1
quietly professor quirrell: 1
neither she nor: 1
professor quirrell that: 1
his most formal: 1
them but houses: 1
the day of: 1
every house color: 1
quirrell turned from: 1
watching audience yes: 1
were anti-malfoy factions: 1
their common foe: 1
if you cannot: 1
of you have: 1
his speech others: 1
what's left of: 1
a great deal: 1
man named yermy: 1
and unbearable shame: 1
eaters agreed to: 1
was strange to: 1
was ridiculous the: 1
supporting the boy-who-lived: 1
ahead - and: 1
or for a: 1
at the boy-who-lived: 1
quirrell turned back: 1
their empty skins: 1
you were not: 1
potter was born: 1
was clear i: 1
full contempt a: 1
an amused grin: 1
how it happened: 1
stop them from: 1
hadn't even thought: 1
as draco it: 1
the enemy to: 1
only drifting black: 1
silence that resulted: 1
quirrell was laughing: 1
he wished to: 1
warming charms didn't: 1
out my intended: 1
malfoy is not: 1
surely it would: 1
came as a: 1
forever but at: 1
worse than the: 1
been defeated by: 1
that your only: 1
own father squarely: 1
two of you: 1
they were still: 1
- harry had: 1
he said but: 1
all the rest: 1
the only important: 1
make you do: 1
it before any: 1
said dumbledore's booming: 1
divided magical world: 1
fun there was: 1
and malfoy meant: 1
visibly tensed up: 1
that would be: 1
potter she said: 1
it took the: 1
draco in a: 1
have learned they: 1
that in hogwarts: 1
times when it: 1
up with a: 1
other risks and: 1
trust in his: 1
boy could grow: 1
things differently they: 1
been one brief: 1
the faint glitter: 1
a memorized speech: 1
the wrong direction: 1
harry potter draco: 1
slytherin to have: 1
something we have: 1
unfairly said professor: 1
that potter has: 1
i make you: 1
if perhaps i: 1
few traitors do: 1
the last soldier: 1
whispered a traitorous: 1
sentiment miss granger: 1
and knew something: 1
mr malfoy draco: 1
back to look: 1
impressed by their: 1
inconvenient a slight: 1
will go on: 1
the crowd with: 1
high voice clear: 1
to draco his: 1
gems with evident: 1
told them to: 1
it will have: 1
anti-malfoy factions who: 1
his voice was: 1
he knows their: 1
be lucius malfoy: 1
terrible dark lord: 1
unbearable shame no: 1
to crush him: 1
true lord dark: 1
smile crossed harry: 1
punished by death: 1
from beside draco: 1
shall grant three: 1
have no confidence: 1
allowed traitors and: 1
snitch what screamed: 1
themselves not too: 1
had never before: 1
of wizardry or: 1
with any request: 1
envelope mr malfoy: 1
potter visibly tensed: 1
a war of: 1
students and his: 1
young to tell: 1
then there was: 1
something tickled at: 1
is that you: 1
himself in the: 1
be kind to: 1
facing a divided: 1
mr malfoy miss: 1
be able to: 1
each other in: 1
ravenclaw how many: 1
he needed to: 1
it had never: 1
was being amplified: 1
nor for the: 1
address the whole: 1
in their house: 1
to commend it: 1
architecture and visual: 1
he meant by: 1
slowly trudged it: 1
meant slytherin -: 1
take that general: 1
saying you're wrong: 1
grant that one: 1
direction is that: 1
should be able: 1
do for themselves: 1
to tire herself: 1
cruelty and strength: 1
i only promised: 1
the occasion to: 1
quirrell he tapped: 1
his face now: 1
tell but that's: 1
they a foe: 1
utter silence went: 1
the two of: 1
was playing into: 1
we'll crush you: 1
future and if: 1
drew a deep: 1
but i already: 1
general potter does: 1
you don't mind: 1
and make no: 1
that harry could: 1
upon all the: 1
those too you: 1
problem is the: 1
pain none could: 1
this country alive: 1
in mingled fury: 1
though you were: 1
a frown on: 1
immediately and with: 1
the front row: 1
still to be: 1
did too little: 1
no further speeches: 1
called upon the: 1
costs them i: 1
now said professor: 1
leaning upon a: 1
danger what people: 1
harry cut himself: 1
should have enjoyed: 1
faced down snape: 1
and getting angrier: 1
backed his own: 1
of you will: 1
my lesson is: 1
if all this: 1
254 behind the: 1
find a leader: 1
twice and the: 1
forth like iron: 1
the vigilantes who: 1
so draco would: 1
if you thought: 1
last envelope beside: 1
waiting to ascend: 1
and we will: 1
fifty professor quirrell: 1
that made him: 1
against both your: 1
- i will: 1
potter if you: 1
harry potter spoke: 1
first envelope mr: 1
was frowning and: 1
seemed to dissipate: 1
first and then: 1
war of extermination: 1
potter just shrugged: 1
that i speak: 1
his wizardry their: 1
voice nor for: 1
win but make: 1
understood that well: 1
also your friends: 1
his cruel grasp: 1
he did not: 1
do said professor: 1
of marble inlaid: 1
wealth and knew: 1
whether there is: 1
potter turned to: 1
might've come but: 1
and defeat the: 1
potter an amused: 1
you all when: 1
just one level: 1
differently they're breaking: 1
the name of: 1
shoot or the: 1
science and use: 1
a house that's: 1
that harry said: 1
stand the watching: 1
everything the other: 1
will on him: 1
three had inscribed: 1
in his eyes: 1
in the last: 1
draco grimly he: 1
lesson but had: 1
else for slytherin: 1
try to take: 1
traitors and a: 1
pyre there have: 1
watching crowd his: 1
rose and the: 1
aghast and there: 1
harry potter an: 1
no one had: 1
agree completely with: 1
claimed to have: 1
speechless silence that: 1
shall have to: 1
at their defense: 1
thought of it: 1
shame no said: 1
to last a: 1
no confidence in: 1
and other students: 1
still looking amused: 1
was laughter though: 1
long enough but: 1
stay beaten but: 1
father had proven: 1
gazed out at: 1
so clearly laid: 1
would they have: 1
most formal voice: 1
pretty difficult coming: 1
and the explosive: 1
when they do: 1
just for wars: 1
know this your: 1
on professor quirrell's: 1
i suppose you: 1
spoil it for: 1
for this to: 1
you up before: 1
of our armies: 1
you must actually: 1
not ask do: 1
worked draco hadn't: 1
to the sound: 1
that the only: 1
spout of fire: 1
and trembling and: 1
booming voice harry: 1
would already be: 1
and beside him: 1
have called that: 1
the four houses: 1
makers hadn't fallen: 1
make no mistake: 1
if one person: 1
students in green-trimmed: 1
this country said: 1
out on large: 1
that i shall: 1
that terrible mark: 1
go ahead and: 1
clearly laid out: 1
everyone is coordinating: 1
and most ancient: 1
make overwhelmingly more: 1
glances - may: 1
against sunshine and: 1
aback granger's face: 1
family is long: 1
evil general chaos: 1
of his wizardry: 1
wait for harry: 1
rule over this: 1
understood what he: 1
has to say: 1
foolish enough to: 1
professor quirrell nodded: 1
she was a: 1
quirrell spoke there: 1
flattery was a: 1
only part of: 1
and then harry: 1
be smart if: 1
person decides to: 1
would have won: 1
you do not: 1
stage waiting to: 1
but this time: 1
have worked draco: 1
to rule strong: 1
obvious implication professor: 1
for i can: 1
fire that left: 1
other just because: 1
in which one: 1
draco knew the: 1
is beyond ridiculous: 1
first person who: 1
speech others would: 1
of hogwarts to: 1
draco blinked and: 1
battlefield draco knew: 1
must actually defeat: 1
the mark of: 1
count for something: 1
you're divided you're: 1
platinum and studded: 1
considerable laughter from: 1
that boy could: 1
meaning to father: 1
sometimes you must: 1
the day that: 1
but by that: 1
like a god: 1
out before you: 1
flushing through him: 1
at its core: 1
should still count: 1
could do that: 1
it this will: 1
traitors up until: 1
very dry indeed: 1
out it seems: 1
and before even: 1
potter was frowning: 1
podium bare of: 1
yes said harry: 1
lord dark or: 1
you're wrong professor: 1
saves you and: 1
recommendation but he'd: 1
in merlin's name: 1
grim intensity his: 1
of hogwarts watched: 1
very act of: 1
he refuses what: 1
at the crowd: 1
that a dei: 1
rules are stupid: 1
traitors to cause: 1
some laughter from: 1
amused smile crossed: 1
propose a mark: 1
perished lucius malfoy: 1
of ravenclaw and: 1
lie for when: 1
still fragmented and: 1
herself out on: 1
them and if: 1
and a soundless: 1
leader then indeed: 1
grave but minerva: 1
that moon-traveling muggles: 1
that was pathetic: 1
draco's recognition an: 1
in the obvious: 1
at least he: 1
hogwarts and draco: 1
it your parents: 1
founder of hogwarts: 1
is that in: 1
nothing to earn: 1
to rely on: 1
measure their empty: 1
dumbledore together had: 1
at the edge: 1
to be obnoxious: 1
uniting your people: 1
most certainly not: 1
draco shot a: 1
into a tight: 1
country and not: 1
see you all: 1
he spoke again: 1
will be lucius: 1
do might be: 1
looked merely puzzled: 1
maybe it was: 1
too failed this: 1
prepared to open: 1
face and for: 1
vigilantes who opposed: 1
be a true: 1
tiniest bit but: 1
do that then: 1
it that people: 1
about that he: 1
a few people: 1
noble and most: 1
you must follow: 1
fair although first: 1
really work together: 1
said granger i've: 1
professor quirrell with: 1
but you will: 1
this not the: 1
beside draco harry: 1
sharp undertone i: 1
the mild voice: 1
standing where draco: 1
the direction of: 1
saw the result: 1
next threat rises: 1
weight upon all: 1
dragon army there: 1
in hufflepuff surely: 1
it was just: 1
i could not: 1
will join forces: 1
hadn't even understood: 1
for good measure: 1
been a stupid: 1
only needed to: 1
god blowing to: 1
whipped dogs and: 1
the riot ended: 1
from the envelopes: 1
they fled like: 1
showed full contempt: 1
inlaid with platinum: 1
tire herself out: 1
they're going against: 1
occurred to draco: 1
himself he wouldn't: 1
his face truthfully: 1
think you will: 1
ridiculous the boy: 1
it again when: 1
all - harry: 1
world could survive: 1
little speech i: 1
that dissatisfaction by: 1
hoped his death: 1
- may i: 1
there are times: 1
work together to: 1
quirrell this too: 1
greater enemy rose: 1
the traitor does: 1
had been half-expecting: 1
it was ridiculous: 1
time beat me: 1
was suddenly stumbling: 1
they're afraid of: 1
muggles were a: 1
in the way: 1
bewilderment and anger: 1
a cheek looking: 1
rely both on: 1
of parchment burst: 1
dark lord's hand: 1
why mr malfoy: 1
fished out of: 1
thoughtful which makes: 1
audience and his: 1
well um said: 1
he'd done it: 1
adults clapped and: 1
seems like they're: 1
with your families: 1
bit but now: 1
rather shaken what: 1
squaring those three: 1
granger traded rapid: 1
cold now as: 1
deep breath there: 1
they wait for: 1
and if we: 1
in the direction: 1
gazed up at: 1
was a wondering: 1
down like weight: 1
dark lord understood: 1
- no said: 1
is to trust: 1
professor turned back: 1
what the boy-who-lived: 1
oh that would: 1
simply wrong your: 1
perhaps fifty death: 1
he wouldn't fight: 1
honest accident but: 1
in the crowd: 1
there was laughter: 1
was any founder: 1
but you mr: 1
i should like: 1
voice that boy: 1
gave the generals: 1
too much to: 1
to apologize for: 1
else is doing: 1
do hope that: 1
for a moment: 1
would see him: 1
look out at: 1
quirrell i mean: 1
and cold as: 1
defense professor with: 1
face of headmaster: 1
voices in the: 1
icily enough is: 1
deep breath i: 1
smiling wryly and: 1
to ascend three: 1
that you have: 1
when you have: 1
can take all: 1
is coordinating using: 1
we will see: 1
head to gaze: 1
- and draco: 1
see it i: 1
peril as well: 1
three children were: 1
had subtly motioned: 1
secrets they tell: 1
ex machina for: 1
filled with a: 1
seen the results: 1
a foe more: 1
is not strong: 1
battlefield shot himself: 1
country were to: 1
first there was: 1
think that i: 1
when the day: 1
sense to just: 1
cowardice if not: 1
i didn't he: 1
potter and draco: 1
them my lesson: 1
dry smile then: 1
that they were: 1
fingers open and: 1
ask your dorm-mates: 1
of britain yermy: 1
ears of students: 1
and you know: 1
but the command: 1
tight fist unity: 1
lord malfoy can: 1
stop them that: 1
this time she: 1
no means to: 1
with the dreadful: 1
will not award: 1
that one there: 1
lived to rule: 1
is fair although: 1
but the outer: 1
winning against a: 1
might be worse: 1
gems of every: 1
that he said: 1
interesting sentiment miss: 1
but dumbledore had: 1
say draco said: 1
sapphire as for: 1
and miss granger: 1
said nothing more: 1
generals it took: 1
that's it said: 1
his mouth that: 1
that this is: 1
you don't notice: 1
any of them: 1
what happens when: 1
snitch ruins the: 1
a dangerously rising: 1
to granger then: 1
unified knowing that: 1
lost against half: 1
slytherin had cheered: 1
the muggles' science: 1
carefully stacking and: 1
able to rely: 1
in a clear: 1
just their mood: 1
rules and the: 1
before you come: 1
they can it's: 1
mark of a: 1
slow decline of: 1
i expected that: 1
a mark of: 1
to gaze at: 1
- there was: 1
malfoy and see: 1
tried with zabini: 1
to be a: 1
lucius malfoy is: 1
be obnoxious most: 1
parents have learned: 1
again when there: 1
problem of everyone: 1
him right now: 1
death eaters were: 1
malfoy draco turned: 1
enough is enough: 1
a few dozen: 1
know the peril: 1
level of the: 1
next time you: 1
were clenched white: 1
for nothing but: 1
there are no: 1
more sense to: 1
parents when you: 1
brief moment when: 1
draco's mind was: 1
they still came: 1
because they were: 1
granger sounding like: 1
over you and: 1
boy professor quirrell's: 1
front row he: 1
still whirling through: 1
him said draco: 1
confusion and make: 1
last war people: 1
the enemy is: 1
not award house: 1
in hogwarts we: 1
angry and dismayed: 1
tore open the: 1
a living country: 1
up until now: 1
inspire others so: 1
will not see: 1
something they wish: 1
harry potter professor: 1
accept the help: 1
down one dark: 1
factions who had: 1
long pause harry: 1
- if you: 1
professor said draco: 1
quirrell there was: 1
open the envelopes: 1
of expression on: 1
was carefully stacking: 1
my speech accordingly: 1
pause harry drew: 1
as december you-know-who: 1
and do nothing: 1
faced one dark: 1
that when they: 1
hand please confine: 1
had done he: 1
said still looking: 1
directly the soldiers: 1
face the sheet: 1
wish somehow i: 1
to symbolize what: 1
guide at all: 1
being fished out: 1
play quidditch without: 1
draco was sure: 1
and went home: 1
direct damage as: 1
platinum podium bare: 1
students very good: 1
and use it: 1
mr potter if: 1
them from doing: 1
when he spoke: 1
single plot there: 1
lord or if: 1
realized as the: 1
plot there was: 1
i'm the general: 1
where draco had: 1
grew up with: 1
them and even: 1
them for him: 1
faced the consequences: 1
professor quirrell he: 1
with a sharp: 1
professor rang forth: 1
his voice firmed: 1
thought to take: 1
death that any: 1
into your wish: 1
quirrell your wish: 1
too weak then: 1
then go ahead: 1
described by the: 1
like cowards and: 1
boy-who-lived or even: 1
granger looking absolutely: 1
the conjuration only: 1
the brightest academic: 1
differently they can: 1
had stretched for: 1
wry grin that: 1
granger's face and: 1
would look like: 1
office with any: 1
firmed as he: 1
trembling and hermione: 1
shattered in an: 1
crisp and cold: 1
in a dangerously: 1
it today i: 1
your ability to: 1
yes that was: 1
mr malfoy said: 1
in your army: 1
day if everyone: 1
as yet but: 1
and confusion and: 1
been dark lords: 1
wish oh that: 1
to 254 to: 1
and mr potter: 1
lesson go home: 1
country said professor: 1
outside foe that: 1
was pretty difficult: 1
draco glanced at: 1
to learn this: 1
frown on the: 1
clenched tight and: 1
would happen to: 1
you might wish: 1
mind was still: 1
as he spoke: 1
the problem is: 1
to take this: 1
of us at: 1
but i will: 1
grow into a: 1
draco he hadn't: 1
a thousand questions: 1
can do for: 1
itself professor quirrell: 1
looking amused i: 1
arts their secrets: 1
he said and: 1
the audience and: 1
the dreadful feeling: 1
at first and: 1
professor's voice say: 1
falling mask and: 1
the work with: 1
one of those: 1
a traitorous voice: 1
eyes flicked briefly: 1
or incompetence would: 1
enemy do you: 1
smile then the: 1
he and granger: 1
you headmaster and: 1
ban them for: 1
today i allowed: 1
and see what: 1
threats aren't always: 1
don't mind said: 1
little to unify: 1
enough and what: 1
and i'm proud: 1
and the enemy: 1
when students in: 1
history your parents: 1
but honorable and: 1
a puzzled pause: 1
stopping wars a: 1
happy to accept: 1
mr potter she: 1
was a susurration: 1
and i'll stay: 1
granger's face was: 1
enough general of: 1
still damp from: 1
wizards but what: 1
laughter though it: 1
a shock draco: 1
to conjure the: 1
voice was amplified: 1
i am skeptical: 1
day that ever: 1
take advantage of: 1
and the death: 1
students can do: 1
cause as much: 1
dark lord or: 1
wishes it had: 1
don't worry said: 1
voice now filled: 1
planned my speech: 1
and helga hufflepuff: 1
and even stranger: 1
make no further: 1
and his voice: 1
the same problem: 1
the rest of: 1
could have been: 1
she had done: 1
been crushed by: 1
almost fell to: 1
that it appears: 1
is strength the: 1
were soldiers from: 1
that harry gasped: 1
professor this is: 1
you saw the: 1
his mouth quirked: 1
every time beat: 1
a way for: 1
of a tearing: 1
some still greater: 1
while they wait: 1
of you long: 1
one dared to: 1
restrain them you: 1
a platinum podium: 1
miss granger before: 1
in the fury: 1
in glitter and: 1
but had decided: 1
to win but: 1
his hand closed: 1
my own family: 1
him you see: 1
headmaster rose from: 1
to the watching: 1
attackers and yes: 1
he spoke people: 1
nodded well said: 1
clenched white there: 1
their secrets and: 1
all that the: 1
him to stand: 1
and the rules: 1
than they a: 1
foe that was: 1
will believe it: 1
long since worked: 1
create the most: 1
granger i've had: 1
costly things to: 1
potter professor quirrell: 1
have made no: 1
country does to: 1
he hoped his: 1
then said that: 1
and was surprised: 1
day's lesson go: 1
is inconvenient a: 1
would be far: 1
if you think: 1
in one way: 1
that inner voice: 1
any outside foe: 1
every house in: 1
or if you: 1
him and draco: 1
then without any: 1
said albus dumbledore: 1
glaring at each: 1
quirrell already turning: 1
make and before: 1
by pain none: 1
quirrell and you: 1
strange to think: 1
but you never: 1
but he'd mentioned: 1
methods he can: 1
you are wiser: 1
cruel grasp forever: 1
a letter to: 1
not a heap: 1
because of the: 1
probably wasn't going: 1
or whatever it: 1
a country of: 1
be encouraged greatly: 1
any battle we: 1
you repeat then: 1
of hogwarts and: 1
now slowly trudged: 1
would inspire others: 1
digging her own: 1
brief intense fire: 1
illusion of wealth: 1
harry potter just: 1
same problem of: 1
their combined talent: 1
had been a: 1
everyone else is: 1
tower of hogwarts: 1
to draco that: 1
ask for i: 1
on him you: 1
soldiers they shoot: 1
left of them: 1
your petty bickering: 1
of sunshine but: 1
shock was showing: 1
into harry's hands: 1
- in the: 1
having enjoyed their: 1
whose fists were: 1
past history of: 1
of strategies more: 1
annoyed yes said: 1
sheet of parchment: 1
- not if: 1
proven foolish enough: 1
pressure like a: 1
and won whispered: 1
nothing but fear: 1
the audience including: 1
will get draco: 1
knew something about: 1
looked taken aback: 1
and no longer: 1
name of sunshine: 1
you are still: 1
professor was carefully: 1
draco said icily: 1
from his hand: 1
leader as strong: 1
years too young: 1
us will use: 1
strong as the: 1
and if in: 1
harry had simply: 1
you have no: 1
a united magical: 1
country of thousands: 1
go the defense: 1
said draco in: 1
granger standing where: 1
a clock it's: 1
an amused smile: 1
two of those: 1
deal to commend: 1
anger and awe: 1
dogs and betrayed: 1
too weak to: 1
a lie for: 1
pause so be: 1
then if one: 1
them that slytherin: 1
somehow i shall: 1
before any other: 1
you prepared another: 1
who called upon: 1
they do not: 1
turning to walk: 1
from draco he: 1
for themselves about: 1
sunshine and the: 1
have seen the: 1
susurration of surprise: 1
is weakness said: 1
fire blasted out: 1
of detached amusement: 1
the crisp december: 1
heard that we: 1
place i'm the: 1
harry potter and: 1
not harry potter: 1
how many of: 1
the nation to: 1
that mr malfoy: 1
make the generals: 1
and quietly professor: 1
irrelevant it would: 1
all this does: 1
breaking the rules: 1
dared to speak: 1
the three parchments: 1
back to his: 1
in a wry: 1
house and also: 1
on his face: 1
i told them: 1
potter's face maybe: 1
yet but the: 1
final score had: 1
by muggles he: 1
a man named: 1
together but i: 1
angry and getting: 1
us a break: 1
sprinkling down from: 1
he was practically: 1
fought back in: 1
not think it: 1
questions and a: 1
despicable cowardice if: 1
strong neither of: 1
surfaces shone with: 1
because they knew: 1
could not grant: 1
applied their combined: 1
and lest you: 1
was bleak and: 1
a chuckle from: 1
you grew up: 1
professor quirrell your: 1
and waited finally: 1
the other players: 1
enough to propose: 1
way but when: 1
rest of our: 1
of their despicable: 1
of ash there: 1
one had proven: 1
defense professor was: 1
granger and i: 1
dissipate the dreadful: 1
win against both: 1
with a wish: 1
a single leader: 1
draco they're slytherins: 1
by you that: 1
whole game said: 1
him her high: 1
no grades low: 1
hunted down one: 1
from either of: 1
it was sad: 1
but what if: 1
more numerous than: 1
ordinarily enjoyed the: 1
then you won't: 1
now it was: 1
costs of unity: 1
we should play: 1
this is not: 1
does not tie: 1
it's something we: 1
quirrell they were: 1
up before then: 1
expect to lose: 1
controlled would have: 1
of course i: 1
to do what: 1
that father had: 1
upon the nation: 1
saw that even: 1
stacking and squaring: 1
quirrell i do: 1
and total make: 1
amused i can't: 1
was sure controlled: 1
mingled fury and: 1
full fifty professor: 1
have deserved to: 1
usual pitfall of: 1
rules so my: 1
all then go: 1
isn't just for: 1
that the three: 1
i'm not saying: 1
wipe him off: 1
symbolize the costs: 1
understand now how: 1
had the occasion: 1
like she was: 1
enjoyed their day's: 1
fell to a: 1
named yermy wibble: 1
professor with bewilderment: 1
each other lucius: 1
lord like an: 1
zabini had shot: 1
speaks out it: 1
knew the shock: 1
fewer aurors who: 1
she thought she: 1
a clear voice: 1
that people only: 1
briefly toward the: 1
albus dumbledore stood: 1
dryly then professor: 1
had awakened or: 1
though lucius malfoy: 1
expression on his: 1
will wipe him: 1
pure and take: 1
or maybe it: 1
for a temporary: 1
dark mark professor: 1
took a moment: 1
silence professor quirrell: 1
i wanted to: 1
that any slack: 1
as you have: 1
words as he: 1
my own behalf: 1
plot and that: 1
what screamed a: 1
tears in his: 1
part saying that: 1
was practically a: 1
albus dumbledore i: 1
you think you: 1
but i wonder: 1
and hard your: 1
potter it was: 1
look in the: 1
rules but if: 1
scatter the clouds: 1
didn't he said: 1
looking thoughtful which: 1
the dangers of: 1
his face appeared: 1
my army and: 1
won't make you: 1
who would have: 1
to like this: 1
advantage of those: 1
granger of ravenclaw: 1
that strategy today: 1
charms didn't seem: 1
of draco's recognition: 1
took up and: 1
been an honest: 1
expression on professor: 1
that's only part: 1
harry's part saying: 1
the audience especially: 1
sad when students: 1
see him haloed: 1
harry could the: 1
his hand please: 1
one-year-old boy professor: 1
find that potter: 1
wouldn't fight against: 1
to do about: 1
clock it's one: 1
them while they: 1
lord understood that: 1
itself draco's mind: 1
part of a: 1
us at stopping: 1
hogwarts we should: 1
game simplicity also: 1
mark this and: 1
muggles' science and: 1
when the next: 1
awakened or whatever: 1
my office with: 1
seemed to build: 1
grimly he hadn't: 1
up being irrelevant: 1
murmurs from the: 1
things differently they're: 1
mentioned harry potter: 1
dropped away like: 1
any dark lord: 1
if everyone decides: 1
as they listened: 1
betrayed each other: 1
quirrell's voice was: 1
how stupid the: 1
out fingers open: 1
to make up: 1
mutually incompatible it's: 1
and teachers and: 1
very carefully and: 1
in slytherin even: 1
are times when: 1
trudged it was: 1
be far too: 1
quirrell's face showed: 1
ask said professor: 1
their eyes met: 1
the first envelope: 1
horror as professor: 1
for a slytherin: 1
see i am: 1
silence had stretched: 1
down from his: 1
truthfully i have: 1
from where draco: 1
eaters were winning: 1
shrugged sorry about: 1
machina for they: 1
was sad when: 1
perhaps have been: 1
as strong as: 1
the world a: 1
that hermione granger: 1
them and then: 1
what a few: 1
save them and: 1
wish to share: 1
are no grades: 1
to hear what: 1
granger have something: 1
there was the: 1
with you miss: 1
dangers of strategies: 1
with platinum and: 1
thousands that is: 1
hope that you: 1
done it it: 1
their wishes were: 1
and there were: 1
that you prepared: 1
of emeralds and: 1
that in public: 1
just because they: 1
defeat the evil: 1
where albus dumbledore: 1
there were tears: 1
does we will: 1
him were being: 1
must follow him: 1
and stop them: 1
not strong enough: 1
had a rather: 1
had shot himself: 1
our armies we: 1
extermination then only: 1
that you had: 1
draco his face: 1
talent to conjure: 1
your will on: 1
you understand now: 1
potter draco wasn't: 1
his eyes and: 1
up from the: 1
i mean that: 1
happened you saw: 1
surprise from the: 1
draft though he: 1
any change of: 1
wish difficult enough: 1
as crisp and: 1
pause as professor: 1
said icily enough: 1
had been raised: 1
the same mistake: 1
emeralds not all: 1
since dead at: 1
it draco malfoy: 1
always be unified: 1
be you won't: 1
that even harry's: 1
again very carefully: 1
you may expect: 1
would create the: 1
the grand stage: 1
all three of: 1
secrets and their: 1
it the defense: 1
mr potter wishes: 1
sunshine but even: 1
visual style from: 1
the dry voice: 1
from every house: 1
voice level the: 1
you to accomplish: 1
the crowd and: 1
wore an amused: 1
before even that: 1
foe harry potter: 1
you have learned: 1
crush him and: 1
the faces of: 1
do not say: 1
the audience as: 1
but for the: 1
face showed full: 1
defense professor rang: 1
wibble knew what: 1
malfoy and then: 1
soldiers from every: 1
pathetic but you: 1
since worked out: 1
my help i: 1
of adults as: 1
lest you think: 1
have fought back: 1
other players do: 1
it snapped harry: 1
unite the death: 1
by any outside: 1
i'll stay beaten: 1
break blaise zabini: 1
for artistry and: 1
make no doubt: 1
together isn't just: 1
granger they would: 1
tie into your: 1
dumbledore and other: 1
that was not: 1
i wonder if: 1
the way that: 1
face appeared calm: 1
were hexing each: 1
promised one cunning: 1
skeptical that hermione: 1
for ravenclaw to: 1
still greater enemy: 1
gigantic spout of: 1
army granger's eyes: 1
harry potter over: 1
voice mark this: 1
been half-expecting the: 1
they were shattered: 1
no recommendation my: 1
for the first: 1
is all that: 1
and if general: 1
even more pathetic: 1
would have defeated: 1
that i'm hermione: 1
in your house: 1
malfoy can be: 1
your time with: 1
instant they fled: 1
because everyone else: 1
moon-traveling muggles were: 1
haloed in the: 1
in public if: 1
as draco's jaw: 1
but not many: 1
other in mingled: 1
she should have: 1
interesting would you: 1
considering for a: 1
and straightened at: 1
minerva and dumbledore: 1
have defeated an: 1
everyone decides to: 1
a divided land: 1
and was leaning: 1
clear and strong: 1
and granger standing: 1
parents nearly lost: 1
have learned nothing: 1
astounded silence had: 1
request consider whether: 1
traitors and we: 1
draco would have: 1
other follies and: 1
his voice level: 1
looked rather shaken: 1
a dramatist would: 1
quite annoyed yes: 1
harry potter it: 1
collective sentiment which: 1
embarrassed look on: 1
chair in glitter: 1
and then he: 1
again and your: 1
illusion of opulence: 1
father squarely into: 1
person who speaks: 1
do not think: 1
thinks about that: 1
and frustration it: 1
and their methods: 1
less without even: 1
what your parents: 1
country by the: 1
not if you: 1
beat me once: 1
standing beside him: 1
that it was: 1
draco thought he: 1
potter over and: 1
fear and no: 1
ruins the whole: 1
the mouths of: 1
and he looked: 1
recognition an interesting: 1
this occasion but: 1
the students in: 1
armies do this: 1
voice as crisp: 1
not daring to: 1
draco had subtly: 1
she took a: 1
and attacking your: 1
quirrell believed that: 1
more oh don't: 1
stranger the obvious: 1
lord but honorable: 1
said granger standing: 1
malfoy will claim: 1
another one harry: 1
it would look: 1
too young to: 1
dark lords who: 1
it well he-who-must-not-be-named: 1
do you think: 1
father did that: 1
clouds but do: 1
using the same: 1
wish that the: 1
you think that: 1
like they're going: 1
then you could: 1
blinked and then: 1
helga hufflepuff created: 1
i say that: 1
term finally harry: 1
puzzlement and the: 1
you come to: 1
exactly the same: 1
quirrell already said: 1
your wish difficult: 1
a brief intense: 1
children were glaring: 1
intensity his right: 1
were being hunted: 1
appears to me: 1
his voice as: 1
dumbledore no said: 1
but their destruction: 1
would speak to: 1
a true lord: 1
and gave the: 1
chaotics looked taken: 1
course i only: 1
was some laughter: 1
others so the: 1
the battlefield there: 1
three of those: 1
lost family to: 1
i shall grant: 1
you're vulnerable in: 1
had been an: 1
outer surfaces shone: 1
never before occurred: 1
lucius malfoy himself: 1
mistake next time: 1
astonished murmurs from: 1
envelopes in which: 1
at each other: 1
met and a: 1
the highest tower: 1
have been wars: 1
be congratulated on: 1
don't mean to: 1
this country to: 1
do because they're: 1
to share draco: 1

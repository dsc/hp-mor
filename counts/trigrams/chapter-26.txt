there might have: 1
the vile little: 1
if that was: 1
quirrell had stumbled: 1
then a biting: 1
was different from: 1

truth if you: 1
a pause professor: 1
said harry to: 1
- his voice: 1
stealing it back: 1
deep breath i: 1
say somewhat to: 1
of forty galleons: 1
you two not: 1
which generates gains: 1
copies which had: 1
door of course: 1
to mind like: 1
for lunch and: 1
he didn't think: 1

the carriage rattled: 1
to this they: 1
doing his best: 1
with the newspaper: 1
used by two: 1
to really notice: 1
do not understand: 1
that much trouble: 1
since the material: 1

of his trunk: 1
to death was: 1
dawn in harry's: 1
again professor quirrell: 1
professor quirrell carefully: 1
it he wanted: 1
quirrell there was: 1
seeming to rather: 1
with her if: 1
when i am: 1
formal while being: 1
of the fire: 1
a much larger: 1
was screaming at: 1
doing anything special: 1
to destroy my: 1
was standing could: 1
important are you: 1
set something in: 1
hallways at least: 1
have viewed a: 1
potter walked past: 1
professor quirrell humming: 1
rowling professor quirrell's: 1
significance to you: 1
to succeed rita: 1
with her failure: 1
harry's adoptive parents: 1
your ability to: 1
flames tearing at: 1
much trouble yes: 1
enough to believe: 1
seemed to really: 1
or his designees: 1
than the dalliers: 1
disappointed that they: 1
this point saying: 1
would happen to: 1
the back left: 1
he had cringed: 1
look professor quirrell: 1
it cost a: 1
looks the fearful: 1
a point mr: 1
delegated the execution: 1
same charms from: 1
vile friends with: 1
11 55 am: 1
anyone valuable with: 1
of gringotts should: 1

you tell me: 1
to what he: 1
and hufflepuff nodded: 1
table in a: 1
were screaming i: 1
to happen in: 1
in the fifteenth: 1
open a path: 1
part as well: 1
quirrell said i'm: 1
not likely to: 1
being railroaded into: 1
gold coins sitting: 1
fewer than four: 1
completely incredulous forty: 1
as his brain: 1
who held it: 1
i see it: 1
things and seeing: 1
official present and: 1
quirrell said frowning: 1
even after hearing: 1
he cared which: 1
at harry for: 1
confused they were: 1
really eating away: 1
middle of diagon: 1
flinched i suppose: 1
out on friends: 1
didn't - need: 1
though the metal: 1
came in bearing: 1
still i wonder: 1
shock on professor: 1
defeated one of: 1
that the next: 1
passed over one: 1
back into professor: 1
because if my: 1
rita skeeter tried: 1
twisting as it: 1
said he wasn't: 1
to him as: 1
for breakfast and: 1
demanded be repaid: 1
to eat lunch: 1
done homework in: 1
were parted in: 1
- sit down: 1
even a metal: 1
to that much: 1
path into a: 1
as children or: 1
have done to: 1
been waiting all: 1
to defy that: 1
are engaged in: 1
got three left: 1
after professor quirrell: 1
didn't think your: 1
they had been: 1
it and the: 1
four different charms: 1
been hacked out: 1
it really wouldn't: 1
- you stole: 1
deserving of all: 1
were run by: 1
so some students: 1
not think it: 1
my more promising: 1
and harry folded: 1
waitress we will: 1
him professor quirrell: 1
pleased with her: 1
rest of our: 1
flee and start: 1
out involuntarily with: 1
pay it back: 1
there a moral: 1
the brief episode: 1
harry was simply: 1
them don't cast: 1
where professor quirrell: 1
and drew forth: 1
do mean all: 1
turned away and: 1
but that is: 1
supposed to be: 1
reason why there: 1
passed around in: 1
it seemed did: 1
the feeling he: 1
execution i don't: 1
sitting diagonally across: 1
been been able: 1
paper cut harry: 1
i do know: 1
likewise said harry: 1
willing to defeat: 1
key harry's muggle: 1
incorrect mr potter: 1
children going through: 1
griphook had stared: 1
skeeter and warn: 1
runes on the: 1
example and professor: 1
that was possible: 1
we might even: 1
soup to start: 1
harry took a: 1
he rose up: 1
his sixth year: 1
by rich people: 1
forth as an: 1
to read about: 1
in the wood: 1
might pay a: 1
accompanied by harry: 1
terrible mood today: 1

harry who almost: 1
real answer was: 1
face no said: 1
imperius professor quirrell: 1
fired from her: 1
it the silver: 1
stacks of gold: 1
requisites for becoming: 1
building professor quirrell: 1
hands tiny droplets: 1
control i simply: 1
room with thoroughly: 1
hufflepuff oh come: 1
surprisingly long pause: 1
there was the: 1
hand to another: 1
a constant feeling: 1
knowledge the students: 1
bill seeming to: 1
harry suddenly wished: 1
up then and: 1
with silver runes: 1
not been given: 1
all that they: 1
debt to the: 1
smiling slightly so: 1
the silver twisting: 1
you mind -: 1
the waitress we: 1
you serious harry: 1
things mr potter: 1
was it sounds: 1
quirrell said he: 1
he actually didn't: 1
would witness the: 1
what they do: 1
just before noon: 1
this particular item: 1
yes said ravenclaw: 1
they were almost: 1
room wearing the: 1
a beautiful blue: 1
which the merely: 1
the ruined inkwell: 1
quirrell don't you: 1
cheer him up: 1
he paused looking: 1
ask at this: 1
few paces behind: 1
when professor quirrell: 1
far away as: 1
believe - and: 1
almost to the: 1
it was like: 1
skeeter oh you: 1
the words there: 1
to diversify his: 1
secondary market in: 1
than usual sit: 1
his letter and: 1
of integrity which: 1
to be directed: 1
what sort of: 1
off the counter: 1
no secondary market: 1
defy that sense: 1
would lose another: 1
his students in: 1
knew or guessed: 1
on the inside: 1
realize that said: 1
harry if you're: 1
albania in the: 1
the hand in: 1
voice had dropped: 1
potter secretly betrothed: 1
be arduous still: 1
his eyes had: 1
seemed that harry: 1
century first things: 1
professor quirrell keep: 1
rather curious but: 1
any choice said: 1
at the same: 1
my enemy i: 1
had cringed and: 1
leaned forward and: 1
shopkeeper had gotten: 1
been a signed: 1
looking closely was: 1
be directed at: 1
it until the: 1
deal with narrow: 1
leather with silver: 1
of my enemies: 1
to read but: 1
he said people: 1
hogwarts need a: 1
you discover something: 1
sitting in a: 1
a photo of: 1

thursday that was: 1
in his vault: 1

an occlumency instructor: 1
sixth-year gryffindor did: 1
the execution i: 1
was the nicest: 1
but no mr: 1
before harry could: 1
alley excuse me: 1
rich people let: 1
flickering rapidly back: 1
again still the: 1
first time you: 1
did not fall: 1
the word 'book': 1
cut harry automatically: 1
what happened the: 1
of the shopkeepers: 1
those if say: 1
from where he: 1
pitying looks the: 1
at all rita: 1
your strength as: 1
a brain could: 1
desk as though: 1
then spoke no: 1
harry thought the: 1
just to knock: 1
gets a little: 1
you can't seriously: 1
under an imperius: 1
have a point: 1
still on fire: 1
them to feel: 1
dark lord departed: 1
frowning that seems: 1
promising students a: 1
know it was: 1
i suppose that: 1
the bookstore seemed: 1
out of harry's: 1
or equity or: 1
when harry potter: 1
resigned smile i: 1
accompanied by several: 1
least five minutes: 1
bearing a platter: 1
they couldn't be: 1
from a utilitarian: 1
you're not running: 1
our life wondering: 1
bookstore accompanied by: 1
arrested but they: 1
feeling of something: 1
have not made: 1
vaults for an: 1
say that is: 1
causing harry to: 1
fee and enforce: 1
door and if: 1
gringotts could be: 1
raised by muggles: 1
suspect since the: 1
so ridiculously obvious: 1
bargained him down: 1
expression was now: 1
a man you: 1
his voice cutting: 1
until he graduated: 1
much he can: 1
originally was probably: 1
and she said: 1
about it secondhand: 1
rita skeeter or: 1
and heard harry: 1
something that cast: 1

then he didn't: 1
and one of: 1
though of course: 1
yes the original: 1
twisted to another's: 1
had balanced the: 1
vanished back into: 1
bit heavy and: 1
the cries of: 1
life wondering what: 1
way an agonized: 1
could simply tell: 1
still dizzy with: 1
like he cared: 1
as an invisible: 1

my reputation but: 1
choice said harry: 1
happy shortly after: 1
swiftly conducted a: 1
nodded i shall: 1
unlike either muggle: 1
good mood mr: 1
perhaps not quite: 1

the wall with: 1
your own sake: 1
transaction which generates: 1
helpless indignation you: 1

a complete failure: 1
to explain anything: 1
diversify his investments: 1
had ever been: 1
quite deliberately announced: 1
by the hand: 1
delivered into a: 1
fury on professor: 1
without headmaster dumbledore: 1

marriage of the: 1
lessons in flattery: 1
his chair and: 1
necessary to perform: 1
congratulatory smiles the: 1

you will appreciate: 1
and set something: 1
and pay it: 1
it was meant: 1
waiting all day: 1

harry was wondering: 1
gains from trade: 1
staggered suddenly lurching: 1
copies of the: 1
dumbledore refusing to: 1
forest it made: 1

harry had a: 1
be quite enjoying: 1
well you didn't: 1
in or out: 1
which hadn't been: 1
impossible but i: 1
that much money: 1
another fifty harry: 1
in the world: 1

of whatever-it-was had: 1
cast a curse: 1
may as well: 1
harry's part as: 1

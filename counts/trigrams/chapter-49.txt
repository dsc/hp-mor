then here is: 1
secrets is real: 1

why it caught: 1

in guessing that: 1
her walk toward: 1
harry's ethics were: 1
superior intelligence and: 1
of abigail myrtle: 1
in fact -: 1
mr potter let: 1
the same as: 1
professor who was: 1

gryffindor was making: 1

blatantly innocent bystander: 1
and speak by: 1

to self thought: 1
looking at harry: 1
leaving him windmilling: 1

professor mcgonagall had: 1
in december professor: 1
you to apologize: 1
comparison to broomsticks: 1
like it was: 1
no longer seemed: 1
come here next: 1
think the dark: 1
1943 oh of: 1
so the line: 1
prompted a student: 1
this year's crop: 1
of evidence significant: 1
would think if: 1
hm i suppose: 1
for the wrong: 1
and slytherin was: 1
monster - probably: 1
you would perform: 1
it anyway there: 1
i will keep: 1
and puddling on: 1
bribe money to: 1
would have been: 1
of the case: 1
shoulders have straightened: 1
privacy invaded by: 1
for silence again: 1
a meter high: 1
silence then and: 1
see why the: 1
some great serpent: 1
the other black: 1

salazar could i: 1
runs back to: 1
we're on the: 1
breath it was: 1
see harry slowly: 1
eyes seldom wavering: 1
believe the chamber: 1
we shall not: 1
meeting the blur: 1
its burden of: 1
i might have: 1
to flying squirrels: 1
something oddly relaxing: 1
possibility whenever extraordinary: 1
should be obvious: 1
professor quirrell and: 1
greatest distance that: 1
mock the obvious: 1
any evidence from: 1
somehow the defense: 1
that godric couldn't: 1
even more the: 1
no sound they: 1
how professor quirrell: 1
great snake had: 1
twisted if only: 1
sick to his: 1
the impression that: 1

three of which: 1
defense professor smiled: 1
asked about parseltongue: 1

harry said the: 1
too good sometimes: 1
climb to power: 1
topic can i: 1
a speed that: 1
his slack mouth: 1
assembly weighed nothing: 1
mr hagrid's expulsion: 1
to clear out: 1
hovered at the: 1
with think posssible: 1
be completely one-sided: 1
mind one way: 1
enough to bring: 1
a hesitant 'ahhh': 1
gone professor quirrell: 1
oh of course: 1
sauce professor quirrell: 1
still as though: 1
hogwarts of muggleborns: 1
his eyes were: 1
you know as: 1

as i ssaid: 1
instead of dippet: 1
slytherin's chamber of: 1

ssmart foolissh thing: 1
he protested now: 1
to defeat a: 1
suspected since december: 1
actual ordering -: 1

quirrell after a: 1
the knowledge that: 1
the rigid control: 1
to let you: 1
as he walks: 1
find salazar's chamber: 1
to the extent: 1
slytherin was remarking: 1
had only wanted: 1
i did wish: 1
centuries come mr: 1
i looked up: 1
off into the: 1
willss the snake: 1
meat strips smothered: 1
to warrant mr: 1
was grinning now: 1
from professor quirrell: 1
like nearly far: 1
statues or architectural: 1
had translated a: 1
had said the: 1
or another there: 1
right even when: 1
ballss of memory: 1
i don't suppose: 1
now we shall: 1
well then mr: 1

heavy-looking sauce plus: 1
off guard i: 1
illegal harry's brain: 1
the carriage professor: 1
avada kedavra said: 1
once harry would: 1
and the sense: 1
tried to think: 1
keyed into his: 1
understood her -: 1
it and if: 1
opportune moment i: 1
potter a plate: 1
harry slowly took: 1
december said harry: 1
secret for that: 1
caught my attention: 1
i would much: 1
a trace of: 1
that murder was: 1
is clearly willing: 1
to move through: 1
dumbledore is clearly: 1
would fix him: 1
shock how -: 1
the distance and: 1
mr potter would: 1
sincere apologies harry: 1
head like it: 1
himself up out: 1
of his wand: 1
surveillance and this: 1
it harry was: 1
hat's message to: 1
only a parselmouth: 1
quirrell was done: 1
your mental privacy: 1
of adrenaline running: 1
turned up any: 1
slowly it had: 1

slithering snakes -: 1
at having been: 1
again and drew: 1
see harry said: 1
enough to warrant: 1
soy sauce professor: 1
did only that: 1
just as harry: 1
secrets so maybe: 1
to harry's advantage: 1
time you went: 1
number thirty-four become: 1
him mr potter: 1
missed that further: 1
- and it: 1
called the chamber: 1
a phrase spoken: 1
of miss myrtle: 1
enough evidence to: 1
parseltongue instead of: 1
sstill in other: 1

discomfort was enough: 1
he harry could: 1
though and i: 1
make sure to: 1

slide home the: 1
tenorman's family chili: 1
hagrid is innocent: 1
in harry's eyes: 1
english - get: 1
cautionary finger then: 1
his reasons were: 1
suddenly feeling sick: 1

the death of: 1
body that you: 1

began eating so: 1
back for him: 1
the stuff he: 1

and with dumbledore: 1
to accuse mr: 1
too just as: 1
this was plausible: 1
recognize it but: 1
never written down: 1
in 1943 oh: 1

harry shook her: 1
his shoulders straightened: 1
question how did: 1
harry said cannot: 1
of secrets hadn't: 1
through leaving him: 1
of wizards that: 1

matter that it: 1
the true explanation: 1
reasons were wrong: 1
which would catch: 1
easy enough to: 1
looked like snakes: 1
the trouble of: 1
wasn't stupid then: 1
quirrell did not: 1
is not a: 1
was a blur: 1
exact but true: 1
from something professor: 1
waiting for him: 1
my firsst classs: 1
and tried to: 1
parseltongue was personal: 1
headmaster of hogwarts: 1

more by reflex: 1
speed that seemed: 1
think about it: 1
from its direction: 1
sshell without dissturbing: 1
then mr potter: 1
if he protested: 1
while sstill in: 1

a certain series: 1
he'd forgotten in: 1
respecting your mental: 1

much respect for: 1
numbers of everything: 1
and his eyes: 1

a sharp breath: 1
paul breedlove had: 1
mr potter said: 1
of secrets so: 1
the snake gave: 1
to be the: 1
parts of harry: 1
to important goals: 1
so you taught: 1

very cunning indeed: 1
of adrenaline that: 1
and some muggle: 1
impatient finger harry: 1
ask myself which: 1
research on the: 1

quirrell said equably: 1
from slytherin's monster: 1
the placing of: 1
remotely like a: 1

i believe the: 1
mr potter a: 1
of memory -: 1
of research on: 1

something odd about: 1
launchers and the: 1
- - just: 1
cannot usse until: 1
hand to slide: 1

harry hesitated in: 1
carriage rolled along: 1
said mr potter: 1
and our marvelous: 1
did reveal something: 1
boy darts another: 1
you that question: 1
most animal predators: 1

you see something: 1
over a frantic: 1
had promised not: 1

of hogwarts in: 1
resolved to stick: 1
slumped back down: 1
hssss no ah: 1
unlesss heir of: 1
headmaster further argues: 1
carriage salutations said: 1
a judicial panel: 1
i discovered that: 1
counted as important: 1
him but he'd: 1
dirt path a: 1
secret harry didn't: 1
hadn't heard before: 1
on dumbledore and: 1
the instant harry: 1
in 1943 approximately: 1
completely off guard: 1
drew his wand: 1
true then here: 1
your usse only: 1
sspeak you ssee: 1
might have persuaded: 1
am not regisstered: 1
than the headmaster: 1
fear mr hagrid's: 1
him and he: 1
the series of: 1
which itself was: 1
an interesting question: 1
resting quietly in: 1
just now of: 1
and climbed into: 1
was done coughing: 1
the snake performed: 1
was telling his: 1
not until just: 1
knox headmaster dippet: 1
blue harry didn't: 1
become animaguss all: 1
warn you mr: 1
of planss beyond: 1
here is what: 1
it had certainly: 1
protested now -: 1
wearing professorial robes: 1
harry prompted more: 1
smiles and beckoned: 1
was true in: 1
miss myrtle and: 1
weighed nothing which: 1
he can do: 1
well it's called: 1
true descendant of: 1
if there had: 1
quirrell said flatly: 1
mr potter professor: 1
hogwarts that looked: 1
this glimpse shows: 1
had become expressionless: 1
of dippet the: 1
in the placing: 1
to any statues: 1
and when he: 1
not professor quirrell: 1
would result in: 1
see anything odd: 1
if you could: 1
anymore harry said: 1
a wave the: 1
system agreed that: 1
well said harry: 1
order to impose: 1
of slytherin but: 1
few calculations whatever: 1
a blur a: 1
though waiting for: 1
was in parseltongue: 1
malfoy has no: 1
if they can: 1
as a hypothesis: 1
talk to flying: 1
while you turn: 1
resulting fight would: 1
his deliberations that: 1
- he'd performed: 1
have - yes: 1
tried only this: 1
at hogwarts and: 1
there were any: 1
to passs unsseen: 1
to go -: 1
him from professor: 1
been your heritage: 1
improbability somehow the: 1
a moment the: 1
had lived you: 1
marvelous justice system: 1
surprised so i: 1
it no sense: 1
quirrell had way: 1
interrupted for a: 1
moment harry didn't: 1
question should be: 1
him as he: 1
with dumbledore applying: 1
though it had: 1
monster powerful enough: 1
to have attended: 1
the dementor your: 1
slytherin's great snake: 1
i would not: 1
was accused of: 1
- the other: 1
a possibility whenever: 1
of us possibly: 1
sstupid ssnake animaguss: 1
was something oddly: 1
will do as: 1
bring you out: 1
dust as he: 1
slytherin's monster the: 1
and then i: 1
use parseltongue instead: 1
of course it: 1
otherss undersstand uss: 1
and a glass: 1
smiling why not: 1
twitched its head: 1
he set his: 1
professor quirrell's chair: 1
echoed why no: 1
undetected spell on: 1
that mr bester: 1
said according to: 1
key question how: 1
face expressionless the: 1
harry nodded grimly: 1
called the lady: 1
animaguss musst be: 1
anything of truly: 1
triumph by force: 1
and professor quirrell: 1
to the waitress: 1
secrets and the: 1
hagrid's expulsion and: 1
monster what harry: 1
parselmouth professor what: 1
the teachers it: 1
water to clear: 1
relaxing harry thought: 1
that was how: 1
have suspected since: 1
bowed to them: 1
the case regardless: 1
lying around where: 1
the monster spoke: 1
do you think: 1
a way just: 1
i ssaid yess: 1
what harry said: 1
that further research: 1
to the trouble: 1
significant enough to: 1
sspeech yess will: 1
myrtle in 1943: 1
any meat in: 1
deduction from something: 1
other parts of: 1
but i did: 1
have a bowl: 1
and instinct than: 1
shock and then: 1
own chair as: 1
been slowly weakening: 1
now well it's: 1
foregone conclusion lucius: 1
why go to: 1
one mr rubeus: 1
mind to another: 1
to him again: 1
matter just what: 1
wasn't the same: 1
but friendship do: 1
it did reveal: 1
past the best: 1
judicial panel may: 1
and drew his: 1
into the chamber: 1
some original magical: 1
enough sentient creature: 1
carriage started in: 1
be feeling grateful: 1
research and some: 1
the lost knowledge: 1
how you think: 1
parselmouth in this: 1
grown significantly stronger: 1
true in a: 1
not to rid: 1
quirrell could've snuck: 1
panicked backward leap: 1

she gave professor: 1
at the moment: 1

probably-mythical tale of: 1
source of you-know-who's: 1
as the snake: 1
i can't say: 1
a boy waits: 1
case far enough: 1
entity which salazar: 1
worth seeing in: 1
turned to look: 1
toward the outer: 1
and they have: 1
of hogwarts had: 1
for he was: 1
- the snake: 1
potential heir of: 1
series of incantations: 1
finger harry closed: 1
would be huge: 1
his heart racing: 1
i was a: 1
further as though: 1
foolissh thing to: 1
less harry said: 1
slytherin keyed into: 1
the revelation was: 1
will find is: 1
personal magic not: 1
not regisstered hissed: 1
starting with everything: 1
up the reference: 1
or suspect first: 1

running through him: 1
on how nice: 1
dirt trail that: 1
harry i found: 1
my sincere apologies: 1
plants or any: 1
might realize that: 1
hadn't turned up: 1
door the other: 1
anyone else to: 1
realized not until: 1
the second time: 1
was that harry: 1
raised a cautionary: 1
obviously innocent he: 1
only to those: 1
'poisonous' the constant: 1
not discovered until: 1
to snakes where: 1
forward and the: 1
bring cloak to: 1
would perform before: 1
grateful to her: 1
would pose to: 1
cavernous mouth as: 1
you are able: 1
whether the revelation: 1
harry would have: 1
the headmaster further: 1
before you reply: 1
faster oh salazar: 1
were flexible when: 1
is a carriage: 1
as a severe: 1
if professor quirrell: 1
personally determined to: 1
sspeak you hear: 1
sseven dayss bring: 1
the dirt leaving: 1
question forgot you: 1
that conclusion based: 1
imagined slytherin's great: 1
what were the: 1
ssnake animaguss not: 1
that slowly it: 1
the whole parselmouth: 1
whole assembly weighed: 1
which is unlikely: 1
would prove yourself: 1
reveal the answer: 1
hisses that translated: 1
well that definitely: 1
to sspeak you: 1
as though in: 1
is not your: 1
are also a: 1
slytherin's monster resting: 1
said harry because: 1
new item of: 1
nodded ansswer in: 1
may rule that: 1
one way or: 1
why no i: 1
was just how: 1
you into the: 1
either by headmaster: 1
iss you have: 1
monster was not: 1
mr potter mr: 1
have not ssaid: 1
but the hiss: 1
that was just: 1
something illegal harry's: 1
sufficiently that i: 1
a lot of: 1
danger it would: 1
in the eyes: 1
hisses which harry's: 1
fact that the: 1
draco to let: 1
making sardonic comments: 1
water but i: 1
first i believe: 1
case of mr: 1
infant self's victory: 1
apologize it is: 1
have already begun: 1
ordering that mr: 1
in dark gray: 1
quirrell raised a: 1
for the moment: 1
not exact it: 1
timed it exactly: 1
guessing that you: 1
would never break: 1
up an old: 1
should have alerted: 1
was standing there: 1
respond only to: 1
are considered and: 1
sweet slithering snakes: 1
short hisses which: 1
it harry kept: 1
you taught mr: 1
could not triumph: 1
of neville chamberlain: 1
forest beside a: 1
scooted back for: 1
truly great import: 1
any suggestions for: 1
of flying squirrels: 1
my occlumency barriers: 1
had nothing to: 1
accuse mr hagrid: 1
would seem that: 1
wonder what they: 1
harry could find: 1
and to find: 1
even though it: 1
barriers then professor: 1
respect rather than: 1
other humanss but: 1
harry took a: 1
hold hourglasss motionlesss: 1
try speaking to: 1
if the discussion: 1
which was in: 1
came to important: 1
an eye only: 1
a knock at: 1
look at him: 1
harry's fault if: 1
wardss while you: 1
in its own: 1
remarking on how: 1
potter it was: 1
therefore her murder: 1
a shiver that: 1
digress the new: 1
for a closed: 1
must continue thinking: 1
potter harry nodded: 1
solve on your: 1
soup and a: 1
give no ssign: 1
huge flaw in: 1
of short hisses: 1
which was exactly: 1
time - you: 1
and harry wasn't: 1
clearly willing to: 1
only a guess: 1
well now let: 1
this time be: 1
before discussing anything: 1
you would not: 1
hesitated in sudden: 1
he-who-must-not-be-named began his: 1
malfoy will only: 1
conclusion lucius malfoy: 1
his face expressionless: 1
time it would: 1
performed a shiver: 1
did not think: 1
secrets hadn't counted: 1
death and comprehended: 1
dementor harry said: 1
hypothesis let alone: 1
become of you: 1
enough to come: 1
i had destroyed: 1
it exactly right: 1
toward the door: 1
had destroyed a: 1
to know it: 1
would have liked: 1
a way to: 1
hopes too high: 1
it's called the: 1
was not that: 1
the headmaster promises: 1
the next descendant: 1
no longer seeming: 1
begun to spread: 1
the carriage started: 1
to recognize it: 1
said and shrugged: 1
was not ready: 1
huge platter with: 1
sometimes he got: 1
the waitress and: 1
had returned professor: 1
could be wrong: 1
i have suspected: 1
crop of students: 1
said equably i: 1
just think harry: 1
said now we: 1
tesst in sseven: 1
undersstand harry nodded: 1
be moved the: 1
was allowed to: 1
i spent a: 1
with a good: 1
of new wards: 1
as though waiting: 1
quirrell did the: 1
student body that: 1
his dry smiles: 1
performed thirty spells: 1
harry was feeling: 1
all the fuss: 1
what the sweet: 1
sentient beings with: 1
to bring you: 1
unless slytherin's monster: 1
secret which itself: 1
i shall have: 1
lord voldemort and: 1
defense professor said: 1
extraordinary people are: 1
prospect of eating: 1
that he-who-must-not-be-named began: 1
to the tablecloth: 1
only that and: 1
telling his priors: 1
answer over the: 1
monster that salazar's: 1
rare the snake's: 1
fuss will blow: 1
have persuaded him: 1
potter i don't: 1
planned to ask: 1
himself second i: 1
be convicted by: 1
tell you what: 1
wanted it harry: 1
some new item: 1
parting words to: 1
me during my: 1
reflect badly on: 1
that lord voldemort: 1
meant 'poisonous' the: 1
professorial robes trudging: 1
act would reflect: 1
seem like sincere: 1
fault that you: 1
and couldn't it: 1
supposedly talk to: 1
- there came: 1
well away from: 1
his eyes seldom: 1
multiple murders in: 1
just there was: 1
silence for a: 1
suppose that the: 1
i digress the: 1
keep your secret: 1
winter holiday i: 1
even though the: 1
the waitress didn't: 1
one give no: 1
was human once: 1
to forget said: 1
with everything you've: 1
it turns out: 1
fine student body: 1
started in motion: 1
shouted by hufflepuff: 1
spoonfuls of soup: 1
a true descendant: 1
suppose that is: 1
this go to: 1
a being who'd: 1
well there might: 1
reason to fear: 1
shoved himself up: 1
then and when: 1
harry said how: 1
sstolen cannot transsport: 1
think posssible to: 1
that harry recognized: 1
evidence of course: 1
the right guess: 1
only you-know-who had: 1
thinking what were: 1
himself you must: 1
hogwarts and all: 1
held up a: 1
they are visible: 1
long as we're: 1
the case and: 1
the magical british: 1
remain closed until: 1
how the hell: 1
a smart move: 1
quirrell said quietly: 1
a cautionary finger: 1
not have any: 1
sharp black pupils: 1
by comparison to: 1
some muggle rocket: 1
after her demise: 1
hear hissed harry: 1
of everything four: 1
to make accusations: 1
then she bowed: 1
excited mr potter: 1
anyone to do: 1
but how the: 1
was making sardonic: 1
not snakes being: 1
to be gained: 1
will you keep: 1
would ensure that: 1
she was able: 1
as was the: 1
to rid hogwarts: 1
of your power: 1
he was human: 1
whatever the secret: 1
said harry so: 1
nonmagical animals besides: 1
simply too good: 1
was remarking on: 1
go to waste: 1
in motion taking: 1
slytherin to another: 1
secrets then -: 1
defense professor had: 1
leap halfway through: 1
that harry's mind: 1
benediction and warns: 1
case and simply: 1
can find it: 1
to a phrase: 1
flying squirrels what: 1
' it wouldn't: 1
which the headmaster: 1
respect for authority: 1
resstricted harry said: 1
to his surveillance: 1
a mournful pattern: 1
distance in another: 1
was looking up: 1
is why certain: 1
students a potential: 1
puzzle you can: 1
of slytherin business: 1
seeming like such: 1
he walks half: 1
patronus charm and: 1
must test whether: 1
and resumed her: 1
got his amazing: 1
beckoned with an: 1
rather questionable logic: 1
a student puppet: 1
indicate that it: 1
it what sort: 1
pose to professor: 1
snake performed a: 1
and stood up: 1
professor would deduce: 1
the resulting fight: 1
robes harry still: 1
the prospect of: 1
who got into: 1
was a bit: 1
in front of: 1
bypass the interdict: 1
said the snake: 1
he was not: 1
first defense class: 1
down enemy with: 1
to another the: 1
backward leap halfway: 1
with a slight: 1
realize the sorting: 1
that looks remotely: 1
eyes stared at: 1
course not professor: 1
from his own: 1
would be most: 1
harry's brain performed: 1
is not quite: 1
his surveillance and: 1
sound they are: 1
trace of dust: 1
not sstupid ssnake: 1
didn't even see: 1
stomach rule twelve: 1
gates of hogwarts: 1
why she was: 1
a useful defense: 1
such progress it: 1
it cannot have: 1
by as the: 1
just what sort: 1
moment i have: 1
feeling sick to: 1
probable to me: 1
for him to: 1
to do it: 1
nothing to hide: 1
professor quirell leaned: 1
his as well: 1
had been very: 1
people are considered: 1
because if the: 1
worried about the: 1
long-lived enough sentient: 1
be keeping your: 1
than he was: 1
potter said professor: 1
is to exhibit: 1
nodded shortly one: 1
a wobbling rasp: 1
potter it should: 1
iss mosst ssecure: 1
harry would never: 1
far to the: 1
hogwarts it is: 1
slytherin but do: 1
lord's mind one: 1
harry still hadn't: 1
also parselmouths the: 1
mr potter that: 1
indeed opened in: 1
asking whether the: 1
regisstered hissed the: 1
or ghosts but: 1
item of evidence: 1
to talk to: 1
a finger for: 1
suspect first i: 1
of short quick: 1
you i wonder: 1
at harry as: 1
classs sstrike down: 1
back to the: 1
dippet prompted a: 1
professor quirrell had: 1
what they would: 1
course said harry: 1
you turn sshell: 1
his climb to: 1
of sometimes evading: 1
from snakes or: 1
lucius malfoy will: 1
only cannot be: 1
he picked up: 1
key the wards: 1
door then professor: 1
been easy to: 1
and flat and: 1
were simply too: 1
it caught my: 1
of his usual: 1
your mind though: 1
to be seen: 1
business actually -: 1
must now remain: 1
a dementor harry: 1
imparting all of: 1
favors the interpretation: 1
headmaster instantly therefore: 1
recounted the probably-mythical: 1
even if he: 1
be wrong said: 1
ensure privacy and: 1
over over the: 1
his throat from: 1
snakes where anyone: 1
too smart judging: 1
i know or: 1
just not exact: 1
though to mock: 1
having been discovered: 1

it shouldn't be: 1
in the end: 1
secret or is: 1

did wish to: 1
returning to his: 1

useful defense against: 1
without dissturbing wardss: 1
on that evidence: 1
advantage to be: 1
her professor quirrell: 1
did not have: 1
a sorceress called: 1
snake but the: 1
to kill anyone: 1
a small clearing: 1
a bit pressured: 1

gave professor quirrell: 1
and turned to: 1

not buying this: 1
his own waterglass: 1

harry's mind translated: 1
- a monster: 1
but to maintain: 1
but he'd forgotten: 1
as professor quirrell: 1
something wrong with: 1
you really care: 1

with an impatient: 1
green soup and: 1
it came to: 1
could've snuck in: 1

how did the: 1
and why it: 1
suspect that all: 1
flaw in sscheme: 1

and if i: 1
unlikely harry was: 1
sorting hat -: 1
next descendant of: 1

direction in the: 1
dumbledore and dumbledore: 1
your fault that: 1
be hard given: 1
don't suppose you: 1
she'd meant not: 1
same as causation: 1
positively glacial by: 1
trouble of creating: 1

then it was: 1
told him not: 1

or by some: 1
not be interrupted: 1

thereby yes harry: 1
your worst memory: 1
the sweat beading: 1
parselmouth when harry: 1

indeed cunning enough: 1
the whole assembly: 1

closed the door: 1
again and resumed: 1
ask you to: 1
to no one: 1
my heritage out: 1
grounds at hogwarts: 1
sorting why you: 1
conclusion based on: 1
a known parselmouth: 1
of secrets is: 1
several spoonfuls of: 1
an old story: 1
so mr potter: 1
harry hadn't done: 1
set his glass: 1
overcome its burden: 1
authority included i: 1
him in harry's: 1
professor what the: 1
harry was nervous: 1
betrayed slytherin's secret: 1
departed when she: 1
all the teachers: 1
wonder if you: 1
had broken past: 1
professor would take: 1
thinly now well: 1
performed legilimency on: 1
to respond only: 1
the man's shoulders: 1
as they say: 1
right guess even: 1
nod many resstrictionss: 1
you-know-who had lived: 1
a major bombshell: 1
day of the: 1
do whatever thiss: 1
sso hissed the: 1
i do something: 1
then - if: 1
a skin-wrapped skull: 1
monster mr potter: 1
the actual ordering: 1
professor quirrell sipped: 1
it looking at: 1
in my firsst: 1
ask you that: 1
right time frame: 1
- ah hssss: 1
snakes temporal sequence: 1
a good enough: 1
secrets was indeed: 1
monster were powerful: 1
hourglasss is resstricted: 1
see him but: 1
- when professor: 1
magic not snakes: 1
treacle soda then: 1
take that as: 1
a snake a: 1
hadn't decided what: 1
first place harry: 1
on professor quirrell's: 1
closed judicial panel: 1
age if there: 1
into the carriage: 1
be sure to: 1
his water but: 1
harry in shock: 1
thirty-sseven ruless number: 1
itself in a: 1
do it for: 1
only a true: 1
them nothing but: 1
steady i was: 1
up his spoon: 1
about the patronus: 1
sat in silence: 1
of course said: 1
progress it is: 1
keys and grounds: 1
hence my interest: 1
if he had: 1
of one mr: 1
not your fault: 1
nobody knew anything: 1
to those who: 1
than calculation shoved: 1
having trouble though: 1
you see mr: 1
of small meat: 1
flashed teeth solid: 1
then i would: 1
she was gone: 1
professor quirrell began: 1
story should go: 1
do not promisse: 1
was too smart: 1
discovered as the: 1
there came a: 1
way just not: 1
smile twisted further: 1
yes professor quirrell: 1
sorely disappointed harry: 1
shadows somehow that: 1
stronger after the: 1
so why slytherin's: 1
the outer bounds: 1
soup in silence: 1
locate the true: 1
stand out as: 1
exact it was: 1
even regret your: 1
flatly he-who-must-not-be-named left: 1

it a useful: 1
is standing well: 1
to his stomach: 1
was something unbearably: 1
do if can: 1
harry nodded a: 1
dark lord nods: 1
or in the: 1
harry thought about: 1
plate of tenorman's: 1
end it is: 1
said as he: 1
convicted by the: 1
your age if: 1
have any suggestions: 1
was slytherin's monster: 1
a small stream: 1
in a heavy-looking: 1
quirrell the defense: 1
- don't become: 1
performed either by: 1
when his reasons: 1
to sway again: 1
hagrid i see: 1
moving past at: 1
their carriage salutations: 1
moment the defense: 1
more background information: 1
the question should: 1
result in the: 1
harry a plate: 1
- the defense: 1
just as professor: 1
and lord voldemort: 1
not die with: 1
said without letting: 1
merely provide some: 1
were powerful enough: 1
enough snakelore to: 1
at harry animaguss: 1

out yesterday ah: 1
of harry's perceptions: 1
on me during: 1
the moment but: 1

letting this go: 1
it his eyes: 1

us suppose that: 1
pattern of black: 1
in white and: 1
was obvious the: 1
dark lord's parting: 1
further ask myself: 1
glacial by comparison: 1

from not hearing: 1
mr potter but: 1
didn't belong there: 1
left there that: 1
thought harry with: 1
shouldn't be enough: 1
headmaster specifically hunting: 1
harry didn't know: 1
animal predators hm: 1
he spoke again: 1
flat you really: 1
to him salazar's: 1
even if they: 1

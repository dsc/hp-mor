an answer and: 1
internally but as: 1

three aurors i: 1
which it had: 1
one who originally: 1
think there will: 1

it was supposed: 1
acceptance out of: 1
was correct harry: 1
leaving behind albus: 1
question that there: 1
headmaster briefly made: 1

ups and downs: 1
feeling a bit: 1
face was a: 1
not described the: 1
gotten into a: 1
hermione yeah said: 1
to me if: 1

acceleration factor that: 1
homework mr crabbe: 1
that is not: 1
was practicing some: 1
shall we dumbledore: 1
will omit a: 1
would you have: 1
ends up inside: 1
as realization hit: 1
thought it was: 1
learned - the: 1
from the treetops: 1
presented itself with: 1
harry they just: 1
nine and three-quarters: 1
mcgonagall had told: 1
her that chance: 1
day and its: 1
he also have: 1
lesser ally or: 1
him - i'm: 1
the sad little: 1
take it out: 1
to give her: 1
potter and hated: 1
not nearly enough: 1
the winter-dried and: 1
so much already: 1
he had done: 1
hogwarts gentlemen harry: 1
bias was the: 1
professor quirrell you: 1
as if they: 1
to the effect: 1
ought to she'd: 1
just kissed him: 1
that he'd thought: 1
work some things: 1
paper on the: 1
empty tattered cloak: 1
him back with: 1
signs of dementation: 1
never work for: 1
enough to disillusion: 1
back then daphne: 1
opened his mouth: 1
first you know: 1
realization hit him: 1
excluded as suspects: 1
i was supposed: 1
james severus then: 1
what you were: 1
looked at her: 1
me you're nuts: 1
the looks he: 1
a prophecy i: 1
my absolute rejection: 1
inscribed simply the: 1
dark lord knew: 1
resident seer seers: 1
but not james's: 1
even understand happiness: 1
at the result: 1
also looking healthier: 1
tongue to the: 1
obliviate yourself so: 1
indeed said dumbledore: 1
in solid rock: 1
finger on his: 1
on the surface: 1
tell you that: 1
had been part: 1
perhaps dumbledore had: 1
the aurors cast: 1
did not count: 1
once walking as: 1
so they'd have: 1
him first tracey: 1
of infant children: 1
if severus had: 1
deepest depth of: 1
the can and: 1
the day i: 1
again said dumbledore: 1
it to mister: 1
him in fact: 1
path back to: 1
an evil plot: 1
it sounds like: 1
now knows who: 1
young ravenclaw until: 1
her friends dying: 1
say about the: 1
it out of: 1
the girls glanced: 1
of luring him: 1
was frightened of: 1
draco malfoy what: 1
doing his homework: 1
make it bouyant: 1
the prophecy had: 1
tell everyone the: 1
said harry they: 1
to hear the: 1
any more the: 1
heard it from: 1
without even hesitating: 1
i don't like: 1
to work indeed: 1
aside foolish woman: 1
have told no: 1
with a strange: 1
remembering his parents: 1
what you've found: 1
said sincerely i: 1
been professor trelawney: 1
but then potter: 1
the course of: 1
to tell everyone: 1
looking healthier though: 1
crust you could: 1
so there was: 1
dumbledore had arranged: 1
with molten lava: 1
for lord voldemort: 1
plot had failed: 1
had told her: 1
else about the: 1
attack therefore with: 1
considered tell me: 1
the threat to: 1
curiosity professor quirrell: 1
then stayed in: 1
the expected reaction: 1
dumbledore had deliberately: 1
of dumbledore's insanity: 1
the headmaster briefly: 1
revealing nothing new: 1
he had continued: 1
i am so: 1
what she'd just: 1
that someone whom: 1
better if we: 1
over this matter: 1
logic was correct: 1
plot what would: 1
you and your: 1
could throw it: 1
meanwhile gregory had: 1
sorts of ideas: 1
slithering snakes was: 1
and reading what: 1
observe said professor: 1
are drunk at: 1
ever explain just: 1
realized he'd already: 1
professor quirrell the: 1
for a few: 1
to be wise: 1
but said the: 1
bulstrode didn't tell: 1
the other two: 1
he had preferred: 1
know and i'll: 1
have begged lily's: 1
of hogwarts had: 1
had tried to: 1
the day and: 1
somehow dumbledore had: 1
front of her: 1
don't mind shall: 1
of charm while: 1
you needed to: 1
maybe even before: 1
on the off-chance: 1
how things are: 1
in the other's: 1
harry said i'd: 1
transfiguration professor had: 1
keep the question: 1
walk the dirt: 1
know that you: 1
but there is: 1
to say about: 1
happy enough but: 1
of that myself: 1
dumbledore said slowly: 1
fast in hogwarts: 1
who dies at: 1
two older men: 1
sky illuminating the: 1
they had never: 1
but on the: 1
her mind -: 1
anywhere young ravenclaw: 1
the ministry you: 1
his death dumbledore: 1
severe you don't: 1
- and most: 1
she got the: 1
to arrange for: 1
davis took a: 1
that harry had: 1
but you are: 1
too late but: 1
make sacrifices for: 1
daphne spun on: 1
up and left: 1
quirrell i know: 1
before then but: 1
said dumbledore but: 1
it is not: 1
you again -: 1
supposed the news: 1
it before then: 1
be wise -: 1
and then gave: 1
space with a: 1
what am i: 1
lovestruck girl who: 1
there is a: 1
said daphne harry: 1
i would prefer: 1
trelawney-seconds professor mcgonagall: 1
as the intermediary: 1
sounds like something: 1
than partial transfiguration: 1
to describe dumbledore: 1
potter the preference: 1
looked back to: 1
told harry about: 1
that blindly or: 1
you this rare: 1
earlier did i: 1
contemplative finger on: 1
prophecy literally say: 1
hermione stared at: 1
had the prophecy: 1
this person had: 1
can hate and: 1
needed to cast: 1
pansy sourly from: 1
repeat them immediately: 1
animal patronus charm: 1
shouted tracey meanwhile: 1
and i'll introduce: 1
pouch then looked: 1
please don't harry: 1
said harry he: 1
wanted to read: 1
work for you: 1
to at least: 1
or dangerous if: 1
said and winced: 1
good woman and: 1
been any number: 1
dying her parents: 1
mr potter why: 1
because it threatened: 1
tell you i: 1
do not press: 1
little the dementor: 1
darkness into which: 1
death dumbledore was: 1
for destroying the: 1
we tell the: 1

it's just an: 1
you minerva you: 1
harry nervous as: 1
in their chairs: 1

an active volcano: 1
some of the: 1
failed and he: 1
in her lap: 1
dangerous to the: 1
led back to: 1
important question what: 1
stand it when: 1

stared at the: 1
see said professor: 1
i can ever: 1
on his cheek: 1
teleport it in: 1
soda can from: 1
a kilometer underground: 1
sure it was: 1
refused to answer: 1
odd smile i: 1
a coloring book: 1
dumbledore had known: 1
opportunity until the: 1
it had taken: 1
dementor's cage could: 1
out a window: 1
introduce it to: 1
harry could not: 1
that et cetera: 1
said nothing for: 1
there's any way: 1
kept private so: 1
in the place: 1
into silence when: 1
considered this question: 1
incredulity said professor: 1
effect that merlin: 1
she was practicing: 1
deaths of harry's: 1
ending the wizarding: 1
me but a: 1
if they wanted: 1
knew it otherwise: 1
hesitating hm the: 1

is powerful enough: 1
exceptionally good at: 1
swinging his feet: 1

and your death: 1
if you had: 1
had touched her: 1
the midst of: 1
they won't know: 1
wonder if i: 1
rich noble house: 1
saving them for: 1
the red light: 1
to realize that: 1
and fawkes started: 1
itself i see: 1
albus dumbledore staring: 1
made harry nervous: 1
end of act: 1
but most easily: 1
quirrell they walked: 1
in utter shock: 1
it's somewhere that: 1
dementor tell them: 1
gregory said in: 1
we couldn't cast: 1
still feeling a: 1
it in if: 1

than that already: 1
to subdue you: 1
dumbledore revealed his: 1
almost ate him: 1
so suppose that: 1
good at killing: 1
leading there so: 1
hitting the ground: 1
dirt path back: 1
system and afterward: 1
question private please: 1

of the patronus: 1
learner to realize: 1
over the course: 1
an anonymous cubic: 1
the hole afterward: 1
in exhaustion and: 1
turn on dementors: 1
dementor ever threatens: 1

echoed in her: 1
office took this: 1
i'll say that: 1
means she'd told: 1
of warm feeling: 1
when he did: 1
it again where: 1
that took something: 1
quickly as they: 1
potter got up: 1
traces leading there: 1
rowena if she'd: 1
that had still: 1
potters by name: 1
people standing upon: 1
charm and the: 1
not lightly refuse: 1
what it means: 1
winced internally but: 1
is not how: 1
hopes of luring: 1
secret is written: 1
dementors and the: 1
to somehow learn: 1
bit peaky though: 1
not work like: 1
sort of charm: 1
this what was: 1
away from the: 1
there were other: 1
for sure it: 1
this in without: 1
or maybe that: 1
there is an: 1
give her that: 1
he got from: 1
he is powerful: 1
thank you minerva: 1
the mariana trench: 1
hole afterward the: 1
was a prophecy: 1
and three-quarters on: 1
some distance apart: 1
molten lava under: 1
himself failed to: 1
had been stronger: 1
if you counted: 1
in silence on: 1
unleashing this one: 1
he ought to: 1
obvious reason to: 1
a very odd: 1
professor quirrell sounding: 1
a warning so: 1
was in fact: 1
i to tell: 1
this rare chance: 1
the natural order: 1
lava under its: 1
hermione put the: 1
greengrass hermione had: 1
it seemed likely: 1
had asked such: 1
earth's crust you: 1
with it it: 1
volcano and hope: 1
conversation harry nodded: 1
of a reply: 1
not think there: 1
she whispered all: 1
expected and then: 1
order it might: 1
had peeled off: 1
in stunned realization: 1
and would have: 1
i told you: 1
to face but: 1
professor quirrell causing: 1
i suppose i: 1
it chilled her: 1
slightly beaten dirt: 1
at least think: 1
worked the animal: 1
to leave any: 1
dangerous but there: 1
bone that harry: 1
a good deal: 1
simply popped the: 1
of his plot: 1
found that needs: 1
don't think there's: 1
upon the winter-dried: 1
both the prophecy: 1
have been sufficient: 1
immediately before your: 1
the six people: 1
potter was all: 1
a finer occasion: 1
of me harry: 1
have you taken: 1
his parents dying: 1
one notes that: 1
let me put: 1
him first you: 1
supposed to work: 1
coloring book millicent: 1
course it does: 1
quirrell the two: 1
comed-tea faded out: 1
you could've been: 1
briefly made harry: 1
don't like it: 1
and afterward of: 1
i am indeed: 1
prefer not to: 1
realized what she'd: 1
inclined not to: 1
than a whim: 1
what exactly was: 1
in hopes of: 1
had not believed: 1
hated james severus: 1
house of the: 1
already couldn't cast: 1
of curiosity professor: 1
stated millicent from: 1
crucial prophecy but: 1
also have told: 1
likely then that: 1
and while her: 1
professor mcgonagall therefore: 1
i'll introduce it: 1
supposed to know: 1
interesting pattern to: 1
little lovestruck girl: 1
therefore dumbledore or: 1
lord voldemort himself: 1
therefore it was: 1
the prophecy were: 1
the whole this: 1
being happy enough: 1
and i suspect: 1
tell the ministry: 1
couldn't imagine how: 1
threatens you or: 1
and gotten into: 1
you that it: 1
are not going: 1
whispered all right: 1
realized that explaining: 1
until you work: 1
'potter' she stared: 1
it otherwise he: 1
thing would be: 1
the character of: 1
would prefer not: 1
voldemort to hear: 1
in a low: 1
was harry's turn: 1
harry so hard: 1
matters if i: 1
simply the number: 1
told dumbledore and: 1
voldemort against killing: 1
killing things my: 1
pretty please with: 1
ensure they are: 1
to see that: 1
and it was: 1
accident or one: 1
or are you: 1
identical charms over: 1
how - why: 1
notes that professor: 1
suspicious of me: 1
taken her refusal: 1
impulse and decided: 1
hogwarts he'd really: 1
- harry began: 1
and frowned briefly: 1
insist on not: 1
for the deaths: 1
loved lily before: 1
dementor plan b: 1
am i to: 1
enough but i: 1
kiss shouted daphne: 1
lily's but not: 1
without changing expression: 1
part simply popped: 1
sacrifices for me: 1
rapidly snapped his: 1
at the defense: 1
character not many: 1
her pouch like: 1
might also take: 1
agreed with your: 1
and the true: 1
can't tell you: 1
pansy's lap what's: 1
to hurt hermione: 1
actually - that: 1
us that we: 1
to she'd really: 1
of my absolute: 1
tried to persuade: 1
circumstances but somehow: 1
on top harry: 1
hadn't undone the: 1
dementor to hogwarts: 1
was the technical: 1
boy smiled a: 1
then but yes: 1
professor quirrell already: 1
every reason to: 1
bouyant and invisible: 1
permission the boy: 1
to platform nine: 1
is not spoken: 1
put it this: 1
love that's why: 1
plot at work: 1
was still open: 1
there so it's: 1
pain and fear: 1
his mouth and: 1
nuts daphne stated: 1
let us go: 1
to produce the: 1
close to the: 1
other's presence mr: 1
was the defense: 1
kiss as soon: 1
seemed likely then: 1
snow-spotted grass near: 1
the sun was: 1
headmaster told you: 1
that was what: 1
so even you: 1
dumbledore himself had: 1
needs to be: 1
had deliberately arranged: 1
or for that: 1
out about the: 1
friends that got: 1
rare so if: 1
lead to lord: 1
that warm and: 1
a riddle and: 1
thinking about it: 1
fact that the: 1
killing lily potter: 1
this instant realized: 1
ask and good: 1
though i shall: 1
potter couldn't cast: 1
about now there: 1
patronus charm hermione: 1
'i told you: 1
daphne harry shoved: 1
when people make: 1
quirrell you destroyed: 1
responsible for the: 1
any traces leading: 1
potter being dangerous: 1
that part of: 1
hm said harry: 1
imagine how harry: 1
time and past: 1
malfoy needs to: 1
maybe it gave: 1
picture in stunned: 1
was a critical: 1
i should've fought: 1
yeah said tracey: 1
this professor quirrell: 1
prophecy identified the: 1
to cast a: 1
begged the dark: 1
all things considered: 1
ideally you would: 1
that harry knew: 1
with a thud: 1
probably tungsten drop: 1
said harry besides: 1
professor about an: 1
lily potter and: 1
sufficient reason by: 1
lord voldemort against: 1
role in their: 1
their mouths shut: 1
book millicent already: 1
harry shoved her: 1
an accident or: 1
you are the: 1
could bury it: 1
professor quirrell inclined: 1
window at the: 1
dangerous if you: 1
she felt frozen: 1
of dying alone: 1
floor lay an: 1
waters of the: 1
the planet -: 1
hate and take: 1
the question that: 1
alone somehow that: 1
sounded even odder: 1
it doesn't have: 1
of which was: 1
and behind the: 1
molten core of: 1
need to fight: 1
war did not: 1
stronger than a: 1
told you that: 1
you're nuts daphne: 1
not james's this: 1
current opinions thank: 1
all there is: 1
the prophecy literally: 1
destroyed the dementor: 1
the horizon the: 1
harry for a: 1
an influence flitwick: 1
then gave up: 1
the kiss as: 1
might not ever: 1
i suspect he: 1
- i'm not: 1
was dying and: 1
what it is: 1
the top and: 1
quirrell remarks to: 1
seeing him dying: 1
speak of such: 1
so it's just: 1
know that is: 1
have told dumbledore: 1
you counted up: 1
well as taking: 1
are you just: 1
house and everything: 1
friends now it: 1
out and kept: 1
say that successfully: 1
- maybe teleport: 1
myself professor quirrell: 1
mcgonagall she felt: 1
if i told: 1
wasn't their first: 1
like it when: 1
to where vincent: 1
the dementor's cage: 1
restored the old: 1
thought of that: 1
like true love: 1
you did not: 1
promise to you: 1
lord voldemort's immediate: 1
trench that's the: 1
to be even: 1
it's true love: 1
sense that this: 1
remained innocent somehow: 1
if you wanted: 1
evil plot what: 1
now it was: 1
death here will: 1
read it though: 1
tell the whole: 1
you wanted to: 1
we walk in: 1
one might say: 1
tossed another to: 1
the headmaster but: 1
harry had taken: 1
he had asked: 1
possibly die no: 1
possibly tell you: 1
where would you: 1
into an active: 1
parents if the: 1
while before professor: 1
things out on: 1
red light fading: 1
were not usually: 1
that an immediate: 1
harry said to: 1
his mouth shut: 1
sweet slithering snakes: 1
it threatened me: 1
dying alone somehow: 1
not usually scared: 1
not find out: 1
was sitting with: 1
does not work: 1
shouted 'i told: 1
defense professor not: 1
james potter to: 1
arrange for harry's: 1
dies at the: 1
mildly inclined not: 1
laugh when you: 1
a contemplative finger: 1
other prophecies of: 1
exert an influence: 1
and then looked: 1
still open in: 1
but tell me: 1
death as the: 1
platform nine and: 1
please was the: 1
at leisure not: 1
potter was my: 1
that war had: 1
young boy in: 1
excitedly and as: 1
you were trying: 1
this was a: 1
incredibly bad idea: 1
charm hermione it: 1
obvious sorts of: 1
would attack the: 1
say 'potter' she: 1
snape who had: 1
the calm with: 1
tell me only: 1
late but if: 1
said one simple: 1
why we couldn't: 1
will ever come: 1
was all evil: 1
but something about: 1
quirrell already couldn't: 1
don't tell us: 1
to the dungeons: 1
hadn't well said: 1
was sinking below: 1
why or where: 1
have been plotted: 1
decided that they: 1
professor quirrell as: 1
only then did: 1
the prior probabilities: 1
and fear and: 1
said harry encase: 1
the important thing: 1
of useless incredulity: 1
glanced at the: 1
lord and i: 1
mr malfoy needs: 1
professor quirrell i: 1
death eaters would: 1
has been a: 1
wizards didn't have: 1
professor quirrell thank: 1
- or just: 1
shall we head: 1
fawkes started singing: 1
tapped a contemplative: 1
be his true: 1
defied him born: 1
to me said: 1
breath and shouted: 1
explain just what: 1
dumbledore and would: 1
but they did: 1
time this is: 1
harry closed the: 1
his hurts had: 1
maybe that had: 1
you hate you: 1
in if there's: 1
that if someone: 1
would you put: 1
and destroy them: 1
and its damage: 1
least think for: 1
make it less: 1
apart as harry: 1
harry hadn't well: 1
not have begged: 1
one upon the: 1
quirrell said sounding: 1
such a foreboding: 1
in fact and: 1
i have been: 1
boys simply kept: 1
much already she: 1
out all there: 1
let me know: 1
also take steps: 1
been the darkness: 1
whole chain of: 1
that chance but: 1
you wish to: 1
already confirmation bias: 1
had been professor: 1
head on back: 1
hogwarts quite some: 1
warning so suppose: 1
i do promise: 1
it was only: 1
you just let: 1
remarks to the: 1
had solved that: 1
was the right: 1
indecipherable glance from: 1
hit him rapidly: 1
will observe said: 1
again where would: 1
the old wizard's: 1
the empty cage: 1
they did not: 1
no professor quirrell: 1
have tried to: 1
dying she hadn't: 1
you just pretending: 1
quirrell said without: 1
said in a: 1
cloak harry felt: 1
mouth was still: 1
truth harry dumbledore: 1
supply but i: 1
today and i: 1
in the earth's: 1
wanted to be: 1
suspects in your: 1
had killed james: 1
there's pain and: 1
fully restored the: 1
no one else: 1
cast your suspicion: 1
planet - or: 1
of with those: 1
professor quirrell saved: 1
to learn only: 1
the whole chain: 1
severus had remained: 1
was a fast: 1
animal form of: 1
occasion shall we: 1
the result harry: 1
can't even understand: 1
usually scared of: 1
no matter what: 1
tell us why: 1
scared of infant: 1
not disturbing him: 1
think for a: 1
when dementors slightly: 1
before professor quirrell: 1
if i should: 1
in a randomly: 1
a whim to: 1
calculation one notes: 1
also looking at: 1
a moment locked: 1
told you -: 1
she was sitting: 1
shouted daphne hermione: 1
the boy in: 1
family mentioned by: 1
smiled a little: 1
of act two: 1
but then the: 1
sinking below the: 1
might have been: 1
like he was: 1
i will not: 1
professor trelawney i: 1
if you'd just: 1
of conversation harry: 1
to be me: 1
quirrell harry said: 1
lily as the: 1
produce the expected: 1
undone the day: 1
0 i rejoice: 1
against killing lily: 1
name it had: 1
question i suppose: 1
pretending to be: 1
tracey said flora: 1
plots severus had: 1
child step aside: 1
classes today and: 1
not save your: 1
charm would never: 1
minerva mcgonagall she: 1
loved lily as: 1
as the saying: 1
know if you: 1
been stronger than: 1
riddle and severus: 1
my supply but: 1
that matter slightly: 1
the dementor plan: 1
harry knew so: 1
cubic meter somewhere: 1
potter if you: 1
advance to cast: 1
if someone doesn't: 1
on the planet: 1
to answer any: 1
hurts had been: 1
had just been: 1
professor quirrell they: 1
ask any more: 1
riddle only too: 1
easily of all: 1
cage and the: 1
melting point probably: 1
professor quirrell then: 1
warm feeling you: 1
head and professor: 1
doesn't sound like: 1
evil until granger: 1
would he also: 1
question what the: 1
her away and: 1
not fully restored: 1
ocean on the: 1
who cannot cast: 1
daphne now oh: 1
to trouble i: 1
if another dementor: 1
sounding genuinely shocked: 1
realized how little: 1
life according to: 1
asking the important: 1
me said the: 1
clarity harry couldn't: 1
into the slytherin: 1
them but something: 1
began to walk: 1
known that an: 1
successfully ending the: 1
sneeze without the: 1
on them to: 1
split leading to: 1
door behind himself: 1
that - harry: 1
back with a: 1
if your bringing: 1
got up and: 1
dumbledore and severus: 1
tracey's face was: 1
dumbledore afterward perhaps: 1
spare lily's life: 1
i thought it: 1
past time to: 1
ever threatens you: 1
into hogwarts i: 1
him rapidly snapped: 1
wise - headmaster: 1
the important question: 1
how little the: 1
and lily trelawney's: 1
figured it out: 1
was ordered storytelling: 1
who'd figured it: 1
intermediary dumbledore had: 1
an incredibly bad: 1
something of a: 1
didn't have the: 1
not be excluded: 1
his cheek i: 1
do that et: 1
it when people: 1
are not to: 1
hadn't told anyone: 1
permission therefore it: 1
who originally heard: 1
snapped his mouth: 1
chairs yes said: 1
out on your: 1
that we are: 1
of the question: 1
i don't think: 1
who had once: 1
at once walking: 1
if your spell: 1
which was inscribed: 1
office and only: 1
had knowingly condemned: 1
gets the prince: 1
the truth harry: 1
well normal again: 1
she realize that: 1
knew of the: 1
death perhaps dumbledore: 1
harry about seeing: 1
seer over the: 1
kissing ' then: 1
lord voldemort to: 1
mcgonagall had been: 1
good deal of: 1
a surprisingly good: 1
myself should not: 1
said daphne don't: 1
love does not: 1
say that no: 1
over and then: 1
save your child: 1
awaiting their memory: 1
she was lily: 1
other two who: 1
each muttered identical: 1
shouted everyone harry: 1
must admit mr: 1
i've just this: 1
to the bone: 1
but you couldn't: 1
ground with a: 1
lily potter then: 1
me know and: 1
face was still: 1
she could bring: 1
head and then: 1
was wearing a: 1
not trust with: 1
to his pouch: 1
randomly fluctuating acceleration: 1
serving dumbledore afterward: 1
to persuade her: 1
or the boys: 1
he'd already answered: 1
who knew of: 1
took something out: 1
professor quirrell spoke: 1
me put it: 1
that the patronus: 1
harry and harry: 1
not repeat them: 1
singing to him: 1
work today your: 1
b said harry: 1
seer seers were: 1
feet in her: 1
as harry had: 1
said dumbledore explain: 1
him to his: 1
have kissed me: 1
takes you hermione: 1
sodas harry said: 1
the place the: 1
girl ought to: 1
a better opportunity: 1
it into space: 1
got him an: 1
then had learned: 1
lily as someone: 1
a notable tendency: 1
can't ever be: 1
saved me from: 1
sounding rather severe: 1
of an evil: 1
the young boy: 1
in justice say: 1
prophecy about harry: 1
top 10 nonetheless: 1
behind the unconscious: 1
said the carrow: 1
to his lips: 1
you couldn't untell: 1
know that there: 1
prophecies of which: 1
with which he: 1
he'd only recently: 1
not trouble myself: 1
a kiss it's: 1
has told you: 1
small and shallow: 1
on tracey incensed: 1
no one would: 1
detection and a: 1
at work today: 1
she stared at: 1
one else about: 1
this is the: 1
them to ensure: 1
snape to somehow: 1
stared at harry: 1
said actually i: 1
for me but: 1
time to ask: 1
nervous as the: 1
if you wish: 1
his friends now: 1
this miss bulstrode: 1
have done about: 1
suppose i shouldn't: 1
anyone nor had: 1
describe dumbledore was: 1
been a lucky: 1
still stunned i: 1
he'd really been: 1
forget if you: 1
who you did: 1
spell hadn't undone: 1
never been but: 1
of dementors aftermath: 1
mcgonagall for i: 1
perhaps you will: 1
twins that sounds: 1
aftermath daphne greengrass: 1
was a plot: 1
charms aftermath harry: 1
was still too: 1
someone doesn't know: 1
him about her: 1
to mister glowy: 1
mr potter said: 1
if it had: 1
illuminating the six: 1
aurors cast detection: 1
you have any: 1
no obvious reason: 1
the seventh month: 1
strangely enough harry: 1
plan b said: 1
quirrell that you: 1
said i'd sort: 1
transfiguration for now: 1
pleasure in destroying: 1
herself the other: 1
am not prying: 1
were rare so: 1
walked on for: 1
on whose floor: 1
peeled off at: 1
obvious if you: 1
practicing some sort: 1
shrieked daphne love: 1
entered into hogwarts: 1
daphne hermione was: 1
you taken to: 1
thought of my: 1
to choose information: 1
- born to: 1
hestia carrow from: 1
and then as: 1
reason to keep: 1
all excellent suggestions: 1
hope it ends: 1
mr potter i: 1
a minor enchantment: 1
mr potter has: 1
so carefully at: 1
and possibly die: 1
sound thank you: 1
an extremely sensitive: 1
again godric hadn't: 1
professor quirrell harry: 1
be the first: 1
couldn't forget if: 1
of albus percival: 1
began no professor: 1
and downs on: 1
was that the: 1
bad idea until: 1
underground in a: 1
selected location -: 1
any way i: 1
over the can: 1
realized not nearly: 1
quirrell then looked: 1
plotted by dumbledore: 1
and everything if: 1
harry harry dumbledore: 1
warm and happy: 1
millicent already told: 1
dark lord which: 1
his plot had: 1
sole purpose of: 1
shouldn't ask what: 1
were other prophecies: 1
friends dying everyone: 1
i can't tell: 1
i'd sort of: 1
during fawkes's singing: 1
say it sounds: 1
can't stand it: 1
distinct body-hitting-the-ground-with-a-thuddish sort: 1
his lips i: 1
sincerely i am: 1
that i have: 1
sleeping aurors awaiting: 1
kind of warm: 1
on my first: 1
in her office: 1
they walked for: 1
of those seer-seconds: 1
costing you to: 1
hear about the: 1
into which it: 1
been its goal: 1
is that the: 1
back mr potter: 1
don't ever doubt: 1
really been supposed: 1
that this was: 1
no kissing ': 1
and that had: 1
written here cryptically: 1
you - harry: 1
they burst into: 1
potter said calmly: 1
to get it: 1
one of the: 1
of a sort: 1
the soda he: 1
a good woman: 1
matter what it: 1
turn but most: 1
hermione had refused: 1
lap leaning back: 1
already told us: 1
if the whole: 1
these sodas on: 1
them - erm: 1
voldemort would not: 1
godric hadn't told: 1
glowy person i: 1
was albus dumbledore: 1
order tracey nodded: 1
walked for a: 1
still drive you: 1
potter the two: 1
worked for destroying: 1
slightly annoy my: 1
about the threat: 1
on severus if: 1
miss bulstrode didn't: 1
launch it into: 1
the molten core: 1
as they'd passed: 1
some things out: 1
a mudblood girl: 1
usual self again: 1
didn't say it: 1
your current opinions: 1
or servant useful: 1
that led to: 1
to think of: 1
this aftermath hermione: 1
to you that: 1
rejoice to see: 1
harry's turn to: 1
been mildly inclined: 1
faded out of: 1
imperiused confunded or: 1
less than i: 1
through she had: 1
killed james potter: 1
done because the: 1
a foreboding question: 1
i rejoice to: 1
taking care of: 1
mantle ah the: 1
at harry i: 1
perhaps the death: 1
quirrell thank you: 1
as suspects in: 1
about to collapse: 1
but i do: 1
servant useful but: 1
said calmly i: 1
that he ought: 1
cast a patronus: 1

some way to: 1
it automatically stayed: 1
to them you: 1
that of course: 1
seemed deeply worrying: 1
said professor mcgonagall: 1
itself with a: 1
recently realized not: 1
peaky though i: 1
no light in: 1
not out of: 1
right kind of: 1
exactly where it: 1
dangerous to lord: 1
but somehow this: 1
shoved her away: 1
be kept private: 1
of the hogwarts: 1
from professor trelawney: 1

just an anonymous: 1
slowly or are: 1

with professor quirrell: 1
carrow twins that: 1
already she couldn't: 1
to fight dementors: 1

to be hitting: 1
pouch like a: 1
aurors awaiting their: 1

and kept their: 1
body-hitting-the-ground-with-a-thuddish sort of: 1
part everyone else: 1
hogwarts had no: 1

at the wax-sealed: 1
is a minor: 1
a whim but: 1
if you knew: 1
potters would still: 1
side of that: 1
it you do: 1
or just pick: 1
a strange diamondlike: 1
of her lifetime: 1
the boy looked: 1
potter i can't: 1
it is that: 1
briefly at the: 1
snape severus snape: 1
her terror of: 1
would have told: 1
where it was: 1
before unleashing this: 1
you saved me: 1
to do once: 1
at the empty: 1
potter has told: 1
questions and as: 1
would make you: 1
was laughing and: 1
and both apparently: 1
above and behind: 1
for now anyway: 1
kiss it's true: 1
trelawney hogwarts's resident: 1
standing above and: 1
dumbledore but you: 1
they'd have to: 1
her about remembering: 1
back into her: 1
chance but then: 1
and shouted everyone: 1
he'd thought it: 1
their own chairs: 1
and left the: 1
his attack therefore: 1
but that part: 1
the boy smiled: 1
at daphne now: 1
of hogwarts gentlemen: 1
the death eaters: 1
a randomly selected: 1
about it automatically: 1
had kissed him: 1
of a seer: 1
was the exact: 1
though she was: 1
far enough away: 1
then that professor: 1
you'd obliviate yourself: 1
the swirling waters: 1
winter-dried and snow-spotted: 1
lose a dementor: 1
his part simply: 1
by itself i: 1
at all had: 1
ever find it: 1
steps but why: 1
the deed could: 1
tip of the: 1
to professor mcgonagall: 1
told anyone nor: 1
could not in: 1
ever need to: 1
important thing would: 1
james potter he: 1
people make sacrifices: 1
soda he had: 1
what it ends: 1
have been so: 1
and a randomly: 1
it in solid: 1
me if your: 1
strange diamondlike clarity: 1
good girl ought: 1
you couldn't forget: 1
please with sugar: 1
killing their infant: 1
at that -: 1
that already confirmation: 1
not to trigger: 1
those seer-seconds would: 1
is the last: 1
quite said professor: 1
brought him back: 1
the earth's crust: 1
fight dementors the: 1
had refused to: 1
child dark lords: 1
for that matter: 1
and lord voldemort: 1
until the end: 1
the dungeons right: 1
to the ear: 1
and crucial prophecy: 1
come a finer: 1
to do with: 1
saying went you: 1
said flora and: 1
the headmaster told: 1
me whispered tracey: 1
lifetime most of: 1
you see other: 1
spilled comed-tea faded: 1
you could throw: 1
who was now: 1
would launch it: 1
i thought of: 1
but this one: 1
going to marry: 1
it less obvious: 1
right harry said: 1
on the soda: 1
that isn't there: 1
- the boy: 1
the wax-sealed paper: 1
seers were rare: 1
injuries as if: 1
deal of useless: 1
told it to: 1
the planet you: 1
with sugar on: 1
tell us that: 1
in hogwarts so: 1
her face was: 1
professor quirrell remarks: 1
chose your information: 1
said the defense: 1
indispensable had begged: 1
location - maybe: 1
you can hate: 1
ate him and: 1
older men each: 1
a hole and: 1
just what you: 1
preferred to spare: 1
potter family mentioned: 1
walking as quickly: 1
crossed the room: 1
legilimized to exert: 1
whole this has: 1
normal again sane-ish: 1
aftermath hermione granger: 1
of doom which: 1
i must admit: 1
kill lily potter: 1
attack on the: 1
lily potter the: 1
some reason seemed: 1
had expected and: 1
among other things: 1
noble house and: 1
answer at that: 1
daphne supposed the: 1
quirrell who was: 1
to do hermione: 1
and the three: 1
only recently realized: 1
the technical term: 1
its goal assassinate: 1
okay it works: 1
at the end: 1
lap what's this: 1
professor was wearing: 1
i'm not sure: 1
them each glanced: 1
the prophecy without: 1
and you did: 1
your bringing the: 1
quite some distance: 1
the memory charms: 1
there's no light: 1
why didn't you: 1
influence flitwick and: 1
randomly selected location: 1
cloak against detection: 1
harry away from: 1
it sounded even: 1
presence of a: 1
i think mr: 1
spoken of with: 1
sources there was: 1
that back shouted: 1
potter that although: 1
millicent from where: 1
with conviction even: 1
again sane-ish the: 1
her lord voldemort: 1
just been a: 1
this still bothered: 1
harry said nothing: 1
find out all: 1
one simple question: 1
is written here: 1
could bring him: 1
but the transfiguration: 1
the headmaster over: 1
are you about: 1
at killing things: 1
to keep the: 1
led to the: 1
bizarre plots severus: 1
they just seemed: 1
bought these sodas: 1
only too late: 1
another dementor ever: 1
sad little lovestruck: 1
ocean trench to: 1
why he might: 1
maybe teleport it: 1
midst of conversation: 1
dementor takes you: 1
changing expression i: 1
was going into: 1
exactly was that: 1
for severus to: 1
with the secret: 1
the secret harry: 1
purpose of killing: 1
true love and: 1
count as extenuating: 1
it when dementors: 1
people to trouble: 1
then looked up: 1
harry potter being: 1
prophecy without permission: 1
harry besides trying: 1
had rowena if: 1
absolute rejection of: 1
a picture in: 1
he was weakened: 1
his smile professor: 1
lily's life according: 1
to know if: 1
their infant child: 1
to ensure they: 1
harry potter got: 1
most of those: 1
not ever be: 1
of sound thank: 1
been a whim: 1
himself and if: 1
ever be a: 1
them i ate: 1
sodas on my: 1
potter what steps: 1
storytelling of a: 1
should've fought granger: 1
to kill lily: 1
she'd told harry: 1
answer any questions: 1
weakened professor quirrell: 1
the one who: 1
of the aurors: 1
hadn't told him: 1
enough then i: 1
as harry without: 1
flora and hestia: 1
into her pouch: 1
what was the: 1
the slytherin dungeons: 1
yes said professor: 1
stayed in their: 1
chance to flee: 1
them began to: 1
that myself all: 1
was a distinct: 1
harry if your: 1
the whole story: 1
earth's mantle ah: 1
gregory had crossed: 1
what the sweet: 1
who had loved: 1
general i should've: 1
to the slytherin: 1
harry said version: 1
lord voldemort and: 1
actually i didn't: 1
looking at daphne: 1
planet you could: 1
spun on tracey: 1
for harry's mother: 1
about dementors and: 1
be not to: 1
are the one: 1
- yes said: 1
and it sounded: 1
that would make: 1
get it into: 1
how small and: 1
it was funny: 1
explaining would be: 1
probabilities said that: 1
meant among other: 1
burst into the: 1
the last tip: 1
as they burst: 1
idea until you: 1
time i'll say: 1
dementors and destroy: 1
hermione granger hermione: 1
tell me what: 1
a high melting: 1
point probably tungsten: 1
leading to the: 1
do not find: 1
conviction even if: 1
said i bought: 1
my general i: 1
back as well: 1
but but what: 1
he was dying: 1
the headmaster's character: 1
her how small: 1
hogwarts so they'd: 1
pattern to them: 1
disillusion himself the: 1
prophecy and the: 1
the injuries as: 1
a critical point: 1
of that war: 1
lily potter's life: 1
been saving them: 1
bury it in: 1
albus dumbledore who: 1
healthier though not: 1
while looking out: 1
what steps have: 1
to choke on: 1
pick some random: 1
harry potter was: 1
to exert an: 1
mouth and then: 1
about the kiss: 1
would be not: 1
like the wrong: 1
depth of ocean: 1
hermione it doesn't: 1
whoa whoa whoa: 1
figured out why: 1
older which harry: 1
identified the child: 1
background noise dropped: 1
her she'd seen: 1
children so there: 1
said if it: 1
choose information sources: 1
and only then: 1
dumbledore while he: 1
they are drunk: 1
another to professor: 1
dumbledore was responsible: 1
better than that: 1
technical term it: 1
even thinking about: 1
somewhere that you: 1
and said thank: 1
spare lily potter's: 1
was a picture: 1
trouble i usually: 1
doubt for a: 1
then looked back: 1
upbringing to turn: 1
harry said all: 1
severus had ended: 1
frightened of dementors: 1
otherwise he would: 1
professor quirrell suddenly: 1
some random other: 1
thud about now: 1
i will observe: 1
in fact a: 1
would not look: 1
inclined his head: 1
to lord voldemort: 1
walking down the: 1
shock harry potter: 1
dropped into silence: 1
on the whole: 1
your turn but: 1
stayed quiet a: 1
or where she: 1
et cetera let: 1
said dumbledore to: 1
a hint you: 1
away with doing: 1
me from i'm: 1
her office took: 1
the logic had: 1
but yes that: 1
decided on it: 1
besides herself the: 1
hadn't realized how: 1
hadn't made the: 1
it wasn't their: 1
you simply tell: 1
explain harry opened: 1
if he did: 1
the potter family: 1
the tongue to: 1
and decided to: 1
other side of: 1
it was albus: 1
had failed and: 1
step aside foolish: 1
the darkness into: 1
harry said actually: 1
did why he: 1
their couches or: 1
any questions and: 1
patronus charm and: 1
had never been: 1
the saying went: 1
you don't tell: 1
thing to do: 1
whole story in: 1
into the mariana: 1
than his smile: 1
the animal form: 1
no caring it's: 1
about an extremely: 1
there might not: 1
enough harry said: 1
can't possibly speak: 1
harry's top 10: 1
prophecy i know: 1
that part everyone: 1
girl you could've: 1
was weakened professor: 1
potter and professor: 1
other things that: 1
dementor had touched: 1
on dementors and: 1
metal with a: 1
place the dementor: 1
you chose your: 1
to be the: 1
although it has: 1
cannot cast it: 1
that was still: 1
his pouch then: 1
have been its: 1
still too painful: 1
up at the: 1
if we tell: 1
all right harry: 1
the riddle successfully: 1
from hermione yeah: 1
you about to: 1
professor snape canceled: 1
wizard on such: 1
this one upon: 1
it this way: 1

gates of hogwarts: 1
of logic was: 1
or there were: 1
be an incredibly: 1
even remember what: 1
up when he: 1
to trigger that: 1
this question i: 1
three-quarters on the: 1
been sufficient reason: 1
been but his: 1
carefully at leisure: 1
mister glowy person: 1
preference had been: 1
of the potters: 1
you destroyed the: 1
i know the: 1
accede to it: 1
soon as they'd: 1
parents dying all: 1
a distinct body-hitting-the-ground-with-a-thuddish: 1
cast the animal: 1
not to disturb: 1
now standing above: 1
your death here: 1
a riddle i: 1

number of wizards: 1
taking honestly i: 1
she'd known there: 1
anything really awful: 1
drive you you: 1
mr potter that: 1
asking only his: 1
a lucky stroke: 1
realize that harry: 1
ravenclaw until you: 1
said i thought: 1
all her friends: 1
would or maybe: 1
i see said: 1
and he had: 1
not being happy: 1
back shouted tracey: 1

frozen she shouldn't: 1
secret than partial: 1
whim but not: 1
logic had presented: 1
not as strong: 1

realization what shrieked: 1
feet off pansy's: 1
as the spilled: 1
a soda can: 1
it from professor: 1
be a coloring: 1
daphne realized what: 1
with a cloak: 1
professor mcgonagall for: 1

she'd seen everyone: 1
than i thought: 1
had once loved: 1
with the sole: 1
harry began no: 1
voldemort had been: 1
her parents dying: 1
woman and true: 1
as strong as: 1
high melting point: 1
shouldn't have been: 1
way i can: 1
confunded or legilimized: 1
put it harry: 1
was still stunned: 1
factor that would: 1
harry nodded but: 1
had it been: 1
ending up that: 1
shocked she shouldn't: 1
quiet a moment: 1
of existence but: 1
distance apart as: 1
am still feeling: 1
for i do: 1
her with strange: 1
make you the: 1
indeed everyone now: 1
someone whom lord: 1
i confess i: 1

dumbledore took a: 1
would be kept: 1
to put people: 1

six people standing: 1
infant children so: 1
month dies harry: 1
extremely sensitive and: 1
us why mr: 1
and lily as: 1
what would have: 1
strong right now: 1
like that of: 1
and take pleasure: 1
chilled her to: 1
ever come a: 1
potter it is: 1
up costing you: 1
down the path: 1
told when you: 1
or ideally you: 1
in destroying what: 1
he'd been through: 1
professor quirrell that: 1
you ever need: 1
left the office: 1
can you not: 1
nearly enough then: 1
i will omit: 1
memory charms myself: 1
she had searched: 1
of hogwarts quite: 1
potter to his: 1
known that prophecy: 1
it works better: 1
tell them i: 1
wizards who'd figured: 1
him and professor: 1
encase the dementor: 1
end of time: 1
go to the: 1
each glanced at: 1
told her about: 1
course you'd obliviate: 1
rare chance to: 1
to it -: 1
already answered interesting: 1
professor was laughing: 1
a moment and: 1
lake first kiss: 1
had heard it: 1
severus snape who: 1
just pretending to: 1
to turn on: 1
was dangerous but: 1
of harry's parents: 1
from harry and: 1
doom which for: 1
be me whispered: 1
had loved lily: 1
a wizard on: 1
someone dangerous to: 1
to fit the: 1
dementors slightly annoy: 1
she couldn't have: 1
of death as: 1
it into an: 1
drank the defense: 1
dumbledore who had: 1
whom lord voldemort: 1
usually ashamed to: 1
see other people: 1
wanted to lose: 1
a vacant cage: 1
if there's some: 1
daphne love does: 1
know it's about: 1
i bought these: 1
below the horizon: 1
somehow learn of: 1
something back as: 1
boy in her: 1
to make it: 1
fading from the: 1
just blurt out: 1
way to do: 1
you realized how: 1
would be an: 1
to ask draco: 1
that the dark: 1
of hogwarts politely: 1
an impulse and: 1
as they could: 1
put people to: 1
does stated millicent: 1
of them each: 1
being dangerous to: 1
the other side: 1
reading in their: 1
revealed his role: 1
potter you simply: 1
heard it first: 1
she finally said: 1
of her for: 1
leaning back and: 1
into space with: 1
seemed like the: 1

rather severe you: 1
in her mind: 1
low voice i: 1

the unconscious forms: 1
severus then had: 1
dementors aftermath minerva: 1
the solar system: 1
the question private: 1
' then harry: 1
trying to do: 1
sitting with gregory's: 1
screamed like he: 1
think of a: 1
lord to spare: 1

without even thinking: 1
calmly i insist: 1
reaction most of: 1
lily before she: 1
this one time: 1
blindly or drill: 1
going anywhere young: 1

professor mcgonagall besides: 1
quirrell as harry: 1
that led back: 1
when he realized: 1
out of curiosity: 1
asked such a: 1
good day and: 1
me harry said: 1
taken to investigate: 1
to the gates: 1
subdue you and: 1
severus if dumbledore: 1
hermione was already: 1
on for a: 1
minerva you are: 1
would have troubled: 1
headmaster's character not: 1
a cloak against: 1
him first tracey's: 1
had its ups: 1
about the character: 1
remember what it: 1
still bothered him: 1
me erm harry: 1
but you can't: 1
yes said pansy: 1

less obvious if: 1
that sense of: 1
had crossed the: 1

about her terror: 1
had no obvious: 1
more secret than: 1
the headmaster who: 1
2 0 i: 1
after what he'd: 1
knew that was: 1
it seemed and: 1
doing anything really: 1
other ocean trench: 1

old wizard's head: 1
the deaths of: 1
that successfully ending: 1
prophecy in hopes: 1
you that i: 1
its damage hadn't: 1
while he was: 1
afterward perhaps the: 1
quirinus said dumbledore: 1
be a better: 1
promise that our: 1
true love that's: 1
get away with: 1
admit mr potter: 1
granger brought him: 1
considered a lesser: 1
continued walking down: 1
said why or: 1
everyone harry potter: 1
not in justice: 1
might say it: 1
a sort daphne: 1
that quirinus said: 1
was time and: 1
point that she: 1
to disturb the: 1
all background noise: 1
the seconds professor: 1
gregory swinging his: 1
as someone dangerous: 1
the bone that: 1
top and drank: 1
parents dying and: 1
lord which he: 1
hint you do: 1
to spare lily's: 1
as extenuating circumstances: 1
luring him to: 1
correct harry could: 1
gave something back: 1
to ask and: 1
he had unthinkingly: 1
then harry screamed: 1
repair the hole: 1
the gates of: 1
that merlin himself: 1
to go to: 1
not sneeze without: 1
trench to make: 1
see one might: 1
hogwarts politely followed: 1
enough away from: 1
i should've i: 1
followed suit harry: 1
was already his: 1
last tip of: 1
they'd passed the: 1
no strangely enough: 1
out why we: 1
steps have you: 1
although lord voldemort: 1
dementor because it: 1
at harry for: 1
knows who i: 1
me what exactly: 1
i shouldn't ask: 1
prophecy or there: 1
that this spell: 1
now there was: 1
you for taking: 1
by asking only: 1
kilometer underground in: 1
usually can't stand: 1
was suspicious of: 1
that had just: 1
had spent in: 1
on such matters: 1
shook his head: 1
wizard's head turned: 1
headmaster's permission professor: 1
only the headmaster: 1
act two you: 1
needs to know: 1
and then perhaps: 1
originally heard it: 1
the off-chance that: 1
but what am: 1
percival wulfric brian: 1
his role in: 1
happy thought hm: 1
said to his: 1
to hear it: 1
turn to walk: 1
leave any traces: 1
any number of: 1
first to tell: 1
there was in: 1
potter he had: 1
but why would: 1
in you at: 1
- headmaster said: 1
to read it: 1
harry she whispered: 1
then as realization: 1
can't even remember: 1
like a good: 1
top harry felt: 1
strong as a: 1
existence but then: 1
took this in: 1
exact five huh: 1
you are your: 1
somehow this still: 1
daphne and tracey: 1
as an answer: 1
which identified me: 1
known there might: 1
it meant among: 1
have the right: 1
first visit to: 1
wax-sealed paper on: 1
would take it: 1
the preference had: 1
something where no: 1
interesting professor quirrell: 1
hadn't worked for: 1
would he harry: 1
paper back into: 1
person i don't: 1
at her with: 1
go straight to: 1
why she could: 1
or legilimized to: 1
harry's parents if: 1

potter's going to: 1
i give you: 1
of that quirinus: 1
suggestions said professor: 1
was that warm: 1
persuade her had: 1
the number 42: 1
harry had expected: 1
should have thought: 1
can from harry: 1
what said gregory: 1
away from hermione: 1
or one of: 1
even odder than: 1
on your own: 1
the potters had: 1
investigate the headmaster's: 1
of my supply: 1
she'd just said: 1
so you are: 1
then why would: 1
die no strangely: 1
subdue her lord: 1
harry potter and: 1
charms over the: 1
it the prior: 1
part of his: 1
are supposed to: 1
i am not: 1
to hear about: 1
nonetheless the looks: 1
a little sadly: 1
and severus snape: 1
seemed to be: 1
could rumor traveled: 1
considered this professor: 1
prophecy i give: 1
filled with molten: 1
is that isn't: 1
professor quirrell who: 1
deliberately arranged for: 1
then perhaps you: 1
automatically stayed far: 1
exhaustion and possibly: 1
special occasions there: 1
tracey nodded excitedly: 1
critical point that: 1
find it again: 1
deed could have: 1
to harry harry: 1
self again said: 1
not to leave: 1
you can laugh: 1
whispered tracey her: 1
in okay it: 1
dying everyone dying: 1
for him -: 1
she couldn't imagine: 1
unthinkingly raised to: 1
harry felt well: 1
- daphne spun: 1
memory charms aftermath: 1
forms of the: 1
extenuating circumstances but: 1
something out of: 1
private so let: 1
fast enough learner: 1

about harry potter: 1
know about this: 1
confess i am: 1
like something of: 1
they continued walking: 1

the prophecy identified: 1
forlornly at the: 1
it has had: 1
finer occasion shall: 1
common room tracey: 1
it needs to: 1
the exact wording: 1
have been saving: 1
put the paper: 1
- harry closed: 1
and most wizards: 1
who have thrice: 1
and past time: 1
voldemort's immediate defeat: 1
such matters if: 1
the news failed: 1
the other's presence: 1
yourself so even: 1
man by asking: 1
and dumbledore himself: 1
such matters without: 1
him it was: 1
that no matter: 1
a while she: 1
himself the aurors: 1
was hard to: 1
an interesting pattern: 1
sensitive and crucial: 1
you take harry: 1
right away if: 1
i should professor: 1
an immediate attack: 1
genuinely shocked mr: 1
the dementor had: 1
few steps in: 1
or maybe it: 1
slytherin dungeons daphne: 1
to cast your: 1
mentioned by name: 1
they couldn't get: 1
the ear whoa: 1
have found harry: 1
couldn't untell a: 1

hogwarts's resident seer: 1
just pick some: 1
behind himself the: 1
attack the house: 1
hogwarts had been: 1
- no she: 1
nodded excitedly and: 1
know what it: 1
lightly accede to: 1
yeah said daphne: 1
and snow-spotted grass: 1
and harry tossed: 1
wand ending up: 1
i don't mind: 1
chain of logic: 1
near a vacant: 1
the carrow twins: 1
once loved lily: 1
harry in the: 1
blurt out about: 1
gentlemen harry said: 1
headmaster it seemed: 1
things are supposed: 1
arranged for lord: 1
please harry don't: 1
on but they: 1
a secret and: 1
little sadly it: 1
flee but i: 1
term it meant: 1
spared but that: 1
made the injuries: 1
tracey had peeled: 1
it was time: 1
learn of the: 1
still lead to: 1
back to harry: 1
no warmth no: 1
for severus snape: 1
give you this: 1
he might also: 1
they walked on: 1
nor had rowena: 1
but a lot: 1
there will ever: 1
about remembering his: 1
did not repeat: 1
afterward the important: 1
does the prophecy: 1
not in the: 1
tracey incensed you: 1
by name does: 1
for his part: 1
five huh said: 1
don't just blurt: 1
a patronus charm: 1
while she couldn't: 1
because the prophecy: 1
moment and then: 1
first actually -: 1
today your wand: 1
everyone dying and: 1
sure which one: 1
it's about dementors: 1
this or maybe: 1
if you ever: 1
harry i will: 1
to flee but: 1
walk in okay: 1
laughing and it: 1
then you could: 1
potter then lord: 1
harry said sincerely: 1
swirling waters of: 1
harry felt an: 1
only some of: 1
great deal and: 1
bringing the dementor: 1
shut you couldn't: 1
the slightly beaten: 1
sources that agreed: 1
not believed this: 1
head turned for: 1
immediate defeat although: 1
reply and then: 1
information sources that: 1
of a riddle: 1
are your usual: 1
and severus had: 1
by dumbledore himself: 1
off at once: 1
it had come: 1
the sense that: 1
me the child: 1
somewhere in the: 1
and hope it: 1
useless incredulity said: 1
up most of: 1
aurors could have: 1
the obvious sorts: 1
myself all things: 1
mr potter it: 1
horizon the red: 1
had searched the: 1
everyone now knows: 1
it earlier did: 1
tracey her face: 1
severus snape severus: 1
had been mildly: 1
can still drive: 1
canceled all his: 1
tracey davis took: 1
you know what: 1
you would launch: 1
he realized he'd: 1
i couldn't even: 1
how harry had: 1
things considered tell: 1
isn't there anymore: 1
things that when: 1
what seemed to: 1
destroying the dementor: 1
the stratosphere or: 1
knowingly condemned james: 1
there's some way: 1
of decided on: 1
smile i really: 1
failed to do: 1
vincent was doing: 1
him dying her: 1
fear and those: 1
one time i'll: 1
lord voldemort considered: 1
steps in silence: 1
the ground with: 1
better opportunity until: 1
woman if you: 1
immediate attack on: 1
me don't ever: 1
nothing for a: 1
his feet off: 1
were albus dumbledore: 1
quirrell suddenly grinned: 1
out of existence: 1
you didn't know: 1
sorry about this: 1
i really should: 1
daphne stated with: 1
steps in advance: 1
when you see: 1
i wonder if: 1
again - and: 1
the potters by: 1
james's this person: 1
not spoken of: 1
for bizarre plots: 1
silence on the: 1
didn't know exactly: 1
wording which identified: 1
then looked at: 1
about this aftermath: 1
the dementor in: 1
room tracey davis: 1
- that doesn't: 1
it might not: 1
him during fawkes's: 1
prior probabilities said: 1
him - daphne: 1
they wanted to: 1
failed to find: 1
prophecy had not: 1
and tracey had: 1
odder than his: 1
that she could: 1
as taking honestly: 1
the last of: 1
he did why: 1
love to me: 1
dirt path that: 1
just said and: 1
assassinate dumbledore while: 1
expected my body: 1
severus who had: 1
are exceptionally good: 1
himself the logic: 1
dumbledore himself and: 1
first tracey said: 1
to tell it: 1
at the swirling: 1
you could drop: 1
voice echoed in: 1
seconds professor mcgonagall: 1
i figured out: 1
the wizarding war: 1
those who have: 1
i expected my: 1
had been a: 1
eyes with professor: 1
riddle i must: 1
do not think: 1
you put it: 1
inside earth's mantle: 1
here cryptically so: 1
behind albus dumbledore: 1
grass near a: 1
both apparently decided: 1
everything if another: 1
once you realized: 1
would still lead: 1
found harry so: 1
now oh yeah: 1
destroy them -: 1
the headmaster pretty: 1
and hestia carrow: 1
prophecy but the: 1
three sleeping aurors: 1
to him during: 1
would never work: 1
of them began: 1
you for everything: 1
then the two: 1
dying and fawkes: 1
dense metal with: 1
i am still: 1
hogwarts i have: 1
active volcano and: 1
you i couldn't: 1
so let me: 1
harry potter couldn't: 1
hard to describe: 1
story now remember: 1
the dementor because: 1
won't know what: 1
she hadn't told: 1
doesn't have anything: 1
dumbledore to professor: 1
voldemort had known: 1
and failed to: 1
the other and: 1
solar system and: 1
of course it: 1
you that this: 1
his homework mr: 1
sane-ish the spell: 1
the wrong person: 1
did promise that: 1
cage could have: 1
with strange sorrowful: 1
just seemed like: 1
she was frightened: 1
severus had been: 1
merlin himself failed: 1
to find them: 1
lose something where: 1
utter shock harry: 1
before lord voldemort: 1
right time this: 1

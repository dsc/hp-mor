and normative order: 1
bella quietus at: 1

hip and wondering: 1
the bright silver: 1
that could harry: 1
just muttering quietly: 1
the right kind: 1
he got everyone: 1
into existence and: 1
within the cloak: 1
own i cannot: 1
i'm in mary's: 1
had halted in: 1
the looming fate: 1
instead of dwelling: 1
looming fate of: 1
of sunlight like: 1
it the thought: 1
was secretly so: 1
their surroundings a: 1
watch noting down: 1
this harry thought: 1
c spiral shielding: 1
awed follow spoke: 1
notice a problem: 1
they're to kiss: 1
a few steps: 1
shouted amelia what: 1
few seconds later: 1
ate a cookie: 1
any and all: 1
that couldn't look: 1
charms winked out: 1
hallows and reputed: 1
coming to him: 1
dark side the: 1
straight into the: 1

to chuckle softly: 1
question why am: 1
out of your: 1
harry's mind like: 1
at her a: 1
if they see: 1
said a chorus: 1
he came harry: 1
other students didn't: 1
whoever that is: 1
my lord the: 1
cat blurred forward: 1
of his tongue: 1
surroundings a young: 1
a man you: 1
time and repeated: 1
2 bellatrix needed: 1
so afraid of: 1
the dementors on: 1
more of those: 1
the box and: 1
softly dusty appreciative: 1
effort not to: 1
then but my: 1
with him in: 1
in a corridor: 1
are you here: 1
effort harry cleared: 1
and wondering if: 1
at the appropriate: 1
confused and then: 1
on the inside: 1
silence none of: 1
fatigue he was: 1
own thoughts she: 1
to dispel his: 1
thought himself so: 1
uncaring of him: 1
on the finger: 1
had hope of: 1
old scroll or: 1
that was when: 1
on the same: 1
can do this: 1
a long silver: 1
would be better: 1
very cold water: 1
centuries relying upon: 1
few moments and: 1
his brain had: 1
knowledge coming to: 1
arose from where: 1
could just be: 1
their voice had: 1
after his patronus: 1
have but it: 1
message only to: 1
professor looking completely: 1
said dumbledore the: 1
levels who isn't: 1
death instead of: 1
found anew and: 1
his scientific knowledge: 1
which harry had: 1
might find was: 1
as a badge: 1
are you all: 1
side the obvious: 1
wearer from the: 1
words used to: 1
cannot find the: 1
and i won't: 1
turned a third: 1
as i can: 1
at each one: 1
were just muttering: 1
had comprehended and: 1
would have been: 1
would not have: 1
and yet harry: 1
long black wand: 1
as one of: 1
communications officer tell: 1
himself feeling very: 1
old wizard's voice: 1
assuming the problem: 1
then harry thought: 1
he had comprehended: 1
and harry couldn't: 1
the fatigue he: 1
he'd never left: 1
he knew that: 1
more - the: 1
recasting her own: 1
the next level: 1
they can sense: 1
bellatrix black that: 1
one soon there: 1
quickly and without: 1
or draco or: 1
to themselves in: 1
his long wand: 1
its own fear: 1
the silver and: 1
her aurors were: 1
of death as: 1
as their team: 1
walls of the: 1
dispelling the previous: 1
a human-shaped patronus: 1
take my hand: 1
left and the: 1
knew do not: 1
own voice there: 1
azkaban the dim: 1
had gotten smarter: 1
mastered the deathly: 1
out except that: 1
on the old: 1
of all creatures: 1
is done dumbledore: 1
hard voice are: 1
to die that: 1
that he'd remembered: 1
him no sense: 1
realization that the: 1
a dark corner: 1
side what it: 1
take time to: 1
metal doors while: 1
to hide bellatrix: 1
said i'm in: 1
and anyone in: 1
of solving the: 1
that was his: 1
seem to raise: 1
of harry's patronus: 1
the impression that: 1
considered the problem: 1
of the vast: 1
wearing that strange: 1
of the requisites: 1
and told it: 1
despairing thought on: 1
brain damage harry: 1
along who'd been: 1
to go on: 1
riddle whose answer: 1
of death far: 1
and bellatrix began: 1
but the old: 1
hide from death: 1
had felt like: 1
only once harry: 1
harry said the: 1
despair for the: 1
harry and his: 1
are you under: 1
people who fall: 1
screwed but assuming: 1
who is afraid: 1
are all on: 1
death dumbledore really: 1
instant for that: 1
child the patronus: 1
was for the: 1
as hard as: 1
dumbledore had decided: 1
you under the: 1
recasting their patronus: 1
energize itself for: 1
she didn't ask: 1
amelia could speak: 1
to live forever: 1
instead of using: 1
upon the impossibility: 1
the director's orders: 1
friends die either: 1
- no that: 1
but assuming the: 1
congratulated his brain: 1
cloak kept you: 1
deathly hallows and: 1
a positive sign: 1
phoenixes now following: 1
time with the: 1
mad-eye's nonstop nagging: 1
impossible harry blocked: 1
and help you: 1
after the patronus: 1
pardon me dear: 1
smarter toward the: 1
that other kiss: 1
ironically enough now: 1
was screwed but: 1
the chains of: 1
easy to forge: 1
come with me: 1
dementors on their: 1
the riddle whose: 1
just be some: 1
lord the dark: 1
that corridor before: 1
then daring him: 1
the restroom actually: 1
was solvable then: 1
debilitated state and: 1
us catch criminals: 1
around the defense: 1
stop the dementors: 1
had said the: 1
are authorized to: 1
futile it might: 1
your aurors to: 1
just like he'd: 1
back you up: 1
later the cat: 1
somehow that he'd: 1
classroom harry thought: 1
thing that only: 1
wolfish smile already: 1
in the instant: 1
aurors the silver: 1
and without hesitation: 1
for you no: 1
calm swapped in: 1
her fingers on: 1
you if you: 1
after a dozen: 1
the obvious inverse: 1
screamed which wouldn't: 1
floated downward soon: 1
the base of: 1
to hide your: 1
was in him: 1
would have claimed: 1
spiral shielding and: 1
it too it: 1
of death's power: 1
couldn't blame the: 1
each one soon: 1
the aurors daring: 1
there wasn't someone: 1
- and that: 1
afterward and if: 1
considered this bellatrix: 1
how can i: 1
violently in her: 1
snapped off the: 1
ways into azkaban: 1
work together on: 1
comfort the track: 1
a moment and: 1
bright creature the: 1
smile for bellatrix: 1
harry said coldly: 1
and the bright: 1
she was no: 1
harry's brain suggested: 1
noting down the: 1
what's wrong the: 1
that it might: 1
journey downward as: 1
period of awful: 1
just strengthening his: 1
emptiness that broke: 1
albus dumbledore inclined: 1
wizard stared at: 1
consequences of their: 1
time you know: 1
die either not: 1
of knowing albus: 1
sense of despair: 1
dementor from a: 1
looked at her: 1
dumbledore then daring: 1
use the adrenaline: 1
its head no: 1
third of her: 1
a corridor of: 1
gripped low the: 1
you find it: 1
that thanks to: 1
have seemed that: 1
darkened to moonlight: 1
didn't report on: 1
and then without: 1
put together it: 1
harry had found: 1
the fault-line that: 1
order all your: 1
the dementors after: 1
downward soon after: 1
die and i: 1
rest of me: 1
corner and hide: 1
charms for ten: 1
a puzzle is: 1
to speak while: 1
merely tired how: 1
overrode her own: 1
creatures began their: 1
maybe they were: 1
to be horrified: 1
face but faking: 1
the shining animals: 1
of wasting it: 1
words somehow overrode: 1
all right thought: 1
- it's all: 1
for the patronus: 1
unconscious bellatrix very: 1
harry thought of: 1
of bellatrix black: 1
was spinning take: 1
nonexistence any more: 1
the cloak was: 1
whatever tiny part: 1
and darkness to: 1
it if he: 1
the requisites for: 1
was on the: 1
might corrode him: 1
you know that: 1
to protect them: 1
his throat forced: 1
crack of fire: 1
throughout a whole: 1
the time so: 1
can sense bellatrix: 1
laughter but she: 1
the dimly lit: 1
the snake draped: 1
was there as: 1
boy stood alone: 1
of the deathly: 1
him might have: 1
and all the: 1
obvious way to: 1
turned and glared: 1
made even her: 1
there wouldn't be: 1
don't go anywhere: 1
only slightly harry: 1
say anything to: 1
without a patronus: 1
new requirements he: 1
wizard's half-moon glasses: 1
dumbledore really wasn't: 1
someone else on: 1
right and in: 1
my patronus answer: 1
a cookie if: 1
as alarmed as: 1
is there another: 1
and he'd have: 1
did amelia and: 1
back the way: 1
him as a: 1
hide bellatrix from: 1
and he hoped: 1
to his own: 1
their own level: 1
outside-the-box idea but: 1
cool bellatrix down: 1
will to protect: 1
anthropomorphic figure had: 1
and perhaps awed: 1
back to him: 1
enough now harry: 1
azkaban though there: 1
brain i want: 1
protect them from: 1
might go mad: 1
you hidden and: 1
find it the: 1
the wards permitted: 1
cursing violently in: 1
mean the slightest: 1
a piece of: 1
harry congratulated his: 1
going to try: 1
of your skull: 1
midair fluttering its: 1
drifted outside the: 1
of death have: 1
he'd just done: 1
nagging but had: 1
mind which of: 1
a luminous moonlit: 1
about what was: 1
and he had: 1
to me he: 1
on the other: 1
mary's place at: 1
uncomfortable thoughts weren't: 1
gesture i hope: 1
then the obvious: 1
to harry she: 1
there another patronus: 1
silver and the: 1
we are all: 1
dismissed their patronus: 1
and it might: 1
kiss her immediately: 1
and harry's patronus: 1
no sense of: 1
was tapping her: 1
cancel their patronus: 1
think straight or: 1
invincible for centuries: 1
out the old: 1
could he meant: 1
kill her and: 1
outshone by the: 1
- the silver: 1
of the problem: 1
aurors to cancel: 1
and they continued: 1
his head to: 1
what it thought: 1
on despair for: 1
death's power enabling: 1
could but he: 1
around and leveling: 1
report on their: 1
right this is: 1
existence brighter perhaps: 1
side are we: 1
bellatrix black freed: 1
thing it had: 1
quirrell had said: 1
scientific knowledge or: 1
when - the: 1
the trick ironically: 1
another word the: 1
prisoner fine snapped: 1
wards permitted it: 1
teeth and put: 1
to leave a: 1
you would i: 1
harry gazed directly: 1
in half-moon glasses: 1
it any more: 1
guess the knowledge: 1
in front of: 1
where they had: 1
wings of sunlight: 1
somehow overrode her: 1
existence and landed: 1
the other half: 1
would do anything: 1
this the track: 1
cloak not given: 1
asked harry would: 1
hidden from the: 1
commanding dumbledore's will: 1
out upon the: 1
refocused his attention: 1
had done the: 1
even less than: 1
it from finding: 1
of evading the: 1
end with him: 1
through that small: 1
her debilitated state: 1
the dementors again: 1
calmly strode after: 1
as unseeable as: 1
flew off and: 1
without another word: 1
coming to pick: 1
susan had kissed: 1
once harry focused: 1
lord you if: 1
that absolute horror: 1
an obvious way: 1
his face shaking: 1
voice of professor: 1
continue searching kill: 1
state and it: 1
is harry asked: 1
the darkest of: 1
couldn't remember it: 1
forward as though: 1
that frightened child: 1
again a final: 1
the face but: 1
its kind are: 1
of any and: 1
or inevitability he: 1
revived half-an-hour later: 1
in azkaban and: 1
sounding puzzled and: 1
incomprehension at the: 1
for the chocolate: 1
patronuses put together: 1
it seems harry: 1
in their company: 1
things he had: 1
the thought of: 1
a frightened child: 1
of a human-shaped: 1
wasn't someone behind: 1
the time-turner again: 1
not just pretending: 1
over said all: 1
sternly i can: 1
that went beyond: 1
the concealment of: 1
silver phoenix sprang: 1
one thing it: 1
was happening can: 1
not stop death: 1
and put a: 1
line harry gazed: 1
temperature was supposed: 1
through holes set: 1
knew what she: 1
away and bellatrix: 1
guessing and yet: 1
the headmaster had: 1
cold water can: 1
his core not: 1
headed outward toward: 1
silver phoenix is: 1
the alienness of: 1
dusty appreciative laughter: 1
her stop existing: 1
kill her harry: 1
i cannot find: 1
to continue searching: 1
dispelled if i: 1
and harry knew: 1
abrupt halt for: 1
if you're not: 1
harry stood straight: 1
on the dementors: 1
head to amelia: 1
blood which painted: 1
cat leaped away: 1
looking backward and: 1
came the next: 1
tip of his: 1
an unutterable fear: 1
flinch this isn't: 1
harry's own voice: 1
concentration with that: 1
as quickly as: 1
able to work: 1
cleared his mind: 1
she'd seen emmeline's: 1
would sacrifice myself: 1
cookie if bellatrix: 1
in distress the: 1
were concealed by: 1
shelter to that: 1
patronus brightened again: 1
legs came to: 1
and keeping his: 1
hesitation instead of: 1
been rather more: 1
or the universe: 1
to help us: 1
of that absolute: 1
the key to: 1
fair there's a: 1
of death the: 1
and which harry: 1
wizard like water: 1
nonstop nagging but: 1
shouted after him: 1
you here to: 1
afraid was it: 1
a failing candle: 1
gotten to the: 1
nodded again will: 1
into the base: 1
the next great: 1
the phoenix with: 1
that was also: 1
but his limbs: 1

professor don't go: 1
pit of azkaban: 1
amelia tell the: 1
on this one: 1
himself in a: 1
the knowledge coming: 1
limbs and then: 1
to - no: 1
her own thoughts: 1
alley going to: 1
calm words somehow: 1
drain him through: 1
me will back: 1
couldn't think straight: 1
fear that would: 1

the vast metal: 1
to implement and: 1
patronus said dumbledore: 1
his own mind: 1
again will you: 1

to energize itself: 1
value himself above: 1

passed down through: 1
and reputed to: 1
took some extra: 1
you say anything: 1
have been eroded: 1
had appeared directly: 1
she'd seen that: 1
to forge the: 1
but to harry: 1
his limbs and: 1
horrified because death: 1
sprang into existence: 1
harry told his: 1
to recollect it: 1
lord's servant replied: 1
used to suppress: 1
or dad not: 1
seeks this patronus: 1
i cannot protect: 1
far outshone by: 1

to amelia in: 1
battle but that: 1
water can be: 1
consume him sneaking: 1

bellatrix might not: 1
and amelia raised: 1
with its own: 1
both of them: 1
around their territory: 1
almost unstrung his: 1
gazed directly at: 1
old witch and: 1
might have been: 1
animals gleamed off: 1
it looking merely: 1
certainly wasn't a: 1
the instant of: 1
nod from the: 1
strange to feel: 1
aurors daring to: 1
do anything not: 1
knew things he: 1

you block it: 1
back and be: 1
moment and a: 1
anywhere if you're: 1
her why he: 1

their rear amelia: 1
black and the: 1
her harry congratulated: 1
a convulsive effort: 1
who'd been rationalizing: 1
into the midst: 1
as obvious to: 1
feel himself split: 1
old wizard turned: 1
something significant something: 1
the cloak to: 1
of scathing remarks: 1
you're not around: 1
right kind for: 1
more vulnerable than: 1
already or they: 1
end of the: 1
the waves of: 1
outward toward the: 1
the point where: 1
adventure believed it: 1
dementors from seeing: 1
to the point: 1
harry realized oh: 1
done dumbledore said: 1
someone behind there: 1
appropriate time you: 1
a strange small: 1
bellatrix down to: 1
silver beard who: 1
forever if he: 1

fault-line that was: 1
acceptance and praise: 1
in his core: 1
will do this: 1
brain considered the: 1
seen that spell: 1
in a nod: 1
the one who: 1
corridor of azkaban: 1
bellatrix began to: 1
despair or inevitability: 1
pretending to be: 1
patronus charm they: 1
this i mean: 1
spoke even less: 1
already would have: 1
that would do: 1
could have stared: 1

what darkness cannot: 1
head looking backward: 1
himself behind at: 1
patronus what said: 1
but uncomfortable thoughts: 1
silver thing that: 1
darkest of all: 1
headmaster had been: 1
any more -: 1

abruptly at a: 1
that only wanted: 1
death is horrible: 1
another bite of: 1
and seize whoever: 1

and if you: 1
without noticeable brain: 1
silver reflections of: 1
it took some: 1
this one now: 1
i see bellatrix: 1

so afraid was: 1
life did not: 1
wizard turned and: 1
the problem was: 1
or to protect: 1
began to bellow: 1
to kiss her: 1
daring him to: 1
delay just as: 1
patronus charm the: 1
harry's patronus wavered: 1
did not value: 1
logic quickly and: 1
exactly right like: 1
you saw on: 1
the flaw the: 1
harry was screwed: 1
how had the: 1
hand harry thought: 1
other patronuses put: 1
never expected or: 1
also knew that: 1
them from the: 1
bellatrix from the: 1
brain on thinking: 1
no longer hidden: 1
amelia turned and: 1
painted the symbol: 1
working their way: 1
was also obvious: 1
fear to energize: 1
mcgonagall sounding as: 1
people for the: 1
his brain on: 1
split in two: 1
to hide from: 1
key to a: 1
auror mccusker finished: 1
you bella no: 1
defense professor looking: 1
out of it: 1
as an anthropomorphic: 1
right now don't: 1
of the flip: 1

lower his plan: 1
of that corridor: 1
of logic quickly: 1
inevitability he was: 1
could go back: 1
wouldn't turn into: 1
were spinning around: 1
blurred forward and: 1
even gotten to: 1
terrified thing that: 1
on the next: 1
rather more difficult: 1
stops then warm: 1
wise dumbledore had: 1
cookie afterward and: 1
answer had been: 1
with that wolfish: 1
of him might: 1
dementors' drain after: 1
we not that: 1
territory parted around: 1
say anything foolish: 1
harry cleared his: 1
the problem-solving part: 1
a dozen small: 1
brain suggested that: 1
way at all: 1
becoming a powerful: 1
the cloak kept: 1
was supposed to: 1
yet harry still: 1
have to dispel: 1
first time susan: 1
this patronus what: 1
peaceful and brilliant: 1
if only he: 1
my friends die: 1
her own patronus: 1
had been repaired: 1
phoenix it is: 1
tell her why: 1
honestly truly believed: 1
i am climbing: 1
bit more difficult: 1
saw on the: 1
no - amelia: 1
forge the face: 1
killer of my: 1
harry's cold whisper: 1

bright red-golden phoenix: 1
silver phoenix flew: 1

a little by: 1
own fear of: 1
a dozen dementors: 1
to the right: 1
head nodded again: 1
am i so: 1
and glared toward: 1
long moment amelia: 1
part of his: 1
through the potter: 1
death and harry's: 1
aurors flinch this: 1
the word there: 1
on this i: 1
already knew do: 1
- a luminous: 1
at his watch: 1
idea but harry: 1
away it felt: 1
held his peace: 1
it became a: 1
old wizard calmly: 1
his attention on: 1
there is another: 1
flaw that avenue: 1
the cloak but: 1
back into the: 1
not to burn: 1
or anyone this: 1
old wizard like: 1
azkaban had stood: 1
and he couldn't: 1
at the alienness: 1
and proper to: 1
the aurors the: 1
that he'd just: 1
damage harry considered: 1
where her brain: 1
to argue but: 1
annoy me harry: 1
first time she'd: 1
shouldn't have mattered: 1
without pausing to: 1
chuckle softly dusty: 1
it took a: 1
it was -: 1
often something you: 1
picked up from: 1
a final nod: 1
or it was: 1
research on which: 1
the adrenaline on: 1
doom would take: 1
about that somewhere: 1
charm they hadn't: 1
burn away all: 1
it was futile: 1
done that could: 1
failing candle -: 1
said the woman: 1
you met only: 1
him and around: 1
have claimed it: 1
found another way: 1
there as quickly: 1
death far away: 1
unwavering light of: 1
from getting her: 1
wouldn't have helped: 1
not unwelcome here: 1
harry still found: 1
metal door on: 1
professor mcgonagall's voice: 1
death himself the: 1
an occlumency barrier: 1
moment amelia wondered: 1
small smile on: 1
the dementors either: 1
they faced the: 1
and block them: 1
ask the old: 1
later without noticeable: 1
it was the: 1
than it could: 1
just as he: 1
phoenix with her: 1
to her mirror: 1
professor in diagon: 1
his foolish mercies: 1
attached to his: 1
and refocused his: 1
mirrors and all: 1
and scanning before: 1
looked up surprised: 1
patronuses didn't report: 1
what do you: 1
azkaban and seize: 1
and held his: 1
harry's brain i: 1
argue but the: 1
its hand politely: 1
piece of himself: 1
brain there's a: 1
horror you don't: 1
a ripple albus: 1
transparency of disillusionment: 1
told it to: 1
- amelia began: 1
behind there or: 1
time she'd seen: 1
the same side: 1
be in the: 1
you i not: 1
know said the: 1
again the world: 1
such power over: 1
do it too: 1
limbs were not: 1
they can see: 1
just done something: 1
he could but: 1
followed his dark: 1
amelia gritted her: 1
professor mcgonagall sounding: 1
problem any more: 1
here to help: 1
white and silver: 1
to that frightened: 1
of it you: 1
proper to be: 1
kissed her cheek: 1
ever heard from: 1
the dementors reach: 1
from death why: 1
unafraid eternal and: 1
there as obvious: 1
only loaned his: 1
stood with a: 1
knew now that: 1
himself from flinching: 1
not mum or: 1
preventing himself from: 1
this i won't: 1
other half of: 1
harry knew now: 1
genetic thing in: 1
go back and: 1
happy thought indeed: 1
never left and: 1
team prepared to: 1
straight or feel: 1
which seeks this: 1
dumbledore honestly truly: 1
one said harry's: 1
the finger of: 1
their actions are: 1
to drain him: 1
cannot protect others: 1
the familiar crack: 1
harry said in: 1
for that desperate: 1
and a blazing: 1
still in him: 1
of the cold: 1
professor mcgonagall was: 1
the impossibility of: 1
a cold unconscious: 1
but that doom: 1
bright creature dipped: 1
answer was that: 1
toward the end: 1
difficult than this: 1
and not have: 1
that had been: 1
in a brightly: 1
was it harry: 1
amelia before amelia: 1
dumbledore the old: 1
deathly smile that: 1
half of the: 1
where are you: 1
body temperature was: 1
me and we: 1
corpse that drifted: 1
his calm words: 1
calmly we are: 1
missing from the: 1
azkaban the darkest: 1
grain of truth: 1
deathly hallows on: 1
of death and: 1
difficult i am: 1
voice said sternly: 1
can the dementors: 1
to its master: 1
could harry do: 1
dementors either it: 1
and be in: 1
to feel ashamed: 1
prepared to eat: 1
their way down: 1
glared toward dumbledore: 1
the slightest bit: 1
death from seeing: 1
absolute horror that: 1
retrieved and ate: 1
towered above them: 1
low the shields: 1
was to make: 1
the abyss of: 1
a chorus of: 1
if they can: 1
own thoughts as: 1
of invisibility one: 1
day and had: 1
for battle but: 1
the things that: 1
the new requirements: 1
of azkaban and: 1

had been repeatedly: 1
turned to the: 1
but she already: 1
right visualizing himself: 1
for bellatrix black: 1

replied sounding puzzled: 1
eroded a little: 1
sneaking through whatever: 1

steady and unwavering: 1
wizard's voice said: 1
true red-golden phoenix: 1

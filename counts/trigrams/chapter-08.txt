the boy said: 3
she was feeling: 3
was just a: 3
and so on: 3
you that challenging: 3
a lot of: 3
next to her: 3
she thought of: 3
challenging my ingenuity: 3
by the way: 3
the boy was: 3
the window and: 3
the boy you: 3
he said in: 3
it was just: 3
she had to: 3
warn you that: 3
an experiment to: 3

no one had: 3
stood up and: 3
i want to: 3
didn't know how: 2
cast a charm: 2
if that doesn't: 2
figure out what: 2
the sound of: 2
no hermione said: 2
anything like that: 2
the six quarks: 2
occurred to me: 2
stared at the: 2
of the train: 2
but it was: 2
back of her: 2
hermione yes said: 2
where this was: 2
numbers have to: 2
that the numbers: 2
ingenuity is a: 2
life a lot: 2
six quarks or: 2
asked to think: 2
the whole train: 2
the rise and: 2
asking for a: 2
hand and snapped: 2
the boy and: 2
that doesn't work: 2
the dark arts: 2
after the boy: 2
is a seer: 2
to help me: 2
and saw a: 2
make a lot: 2
the door behind: 2
the boy opened: 2
is that you: 2
boy opened the: 2
harry potter said: 2
may tend to: 2
that your answer: 2
modern magical history: 2
i went to: 2
the kind of: 2
that was the: 2
like she was: 2
to her that: 2
i'm in books: 2
said you were: 2
hermione granger it: 2
it was like: 2
dangerous sort of: 2
the numbers have: 2
and see how: 2
the very first: 2
looked like he: 2
the rule and: 2
lot more surreal: 2
at the door: 2
you think you: 2
that hermione realized: 2
was starting to: 2
imagine experiments that: 2
is how it: 2
and snapped his: 2
rise and fall: 2
if it doesn't: 2
it was a: 2
your life a: 2
and fall of: 2
sort of project: 2
i don't think: 2
just as hermione: 2
day of school: 2
harry potter the: 2
said hermione yes: 2
to demonstrate my: 2
the twentieth century: 2
there was a: 2
a bit of: 2
if luna is: 2
and see if: 2
the rule say: 2
and he was: 2
around his head: 2
do you want: 2
my ingenuity is: 2
ever been asked: 2
find a prefect: 2
think on a: 2
her mouth to: 2
all of the: 2
answer is that: 2
to test your: 2
hermione said and: 2
she felt like: 2
robes and see: 2
sit down next: 2
what you did: 2
that should make: 2
in the back: 2
door opening and: 2
this point that: 2
he has nightmares: 2
it was actually: 2
his pouch and: 2
that they were: 2
been asked to: 2
luna is a: 2
is that your: 2
me to warn: 2
on the train: 2
said can i: 2
to me that: 2
make the rule: 2
cast her mind: 2
i didn't say: 2
on the door: 2
saw a young: 2
looked at her: 2
only 20 of: 2
in my trunk: 2
is a dangerous: 2
way the boy: 2
even as she: 2
a prefect who: 2
for help that: 2
help you with: 2
just in case: 2
experiment to test: 2
fred and george: 2
should make the: 2
wizarding events of: 2
hermione opened her: 2
at this point: 2
that this was: 2
experiments that could: 2
of grownups get: 2

you to help: 2
tried to cast: 2
events of the: 2
the front car: 2
the baconian project: 2

all the other: 2
harry potter was: 2
fall of the: 2
next to him: 2
needed to do: 2
to her and: 2
on a test: 2
the train to: 2
if he has: 2
boy in a: 2
demonstrate my intelligence: 2
see if it: 2
to go up: 2
hermione's mind was: 2
to be a: 2
that i don't: 2
snapping my fingers: 2
of the twentieth: 2
tend to make: 2
test your hypothesis: 2
if you were: 2
to warn you: 2
on my robes: 2
the boy looked: 2
to the front: 2
that it was: 2
were hermione granger: 2
can of soda: 2
think of any: 2
great wizarding events: 2
in the middle: 2
20 of grownups: 2
on the floor: 2
my name is: 2
to say it: 2
point that hermione: 2
at his trunk: 2
in fact she: 2
do you have: 2
first day of: 2
and if that: 2
him all the: 2
i help you: 2
part of her: 2
that could have: 2
how you did: 2
we'll find a: 2
the rule is: 2
snapped his fingers: 2
as many triplets: 2
the ruins of: 2
was beginning to: 2
'yes' if the: 2
form a hypothesis: 2
shut her eyes: 2
the boy is: 2
of three numbers: 2
what she was: 2
by snapping my: 2
into his pouch: 2
boy is that: 2
to think on: 2
out everything i: 2
the paper out: 2
train to hogwarts: 2
how to do: 2
the scar on: 2
inside the cabin: 2
like he might: 2
the boy hermione: 2
you were hermione: 2
help that was: 2
and if we: 2
of project and: 2
to talk to: 2
what what what: 2
so on i: 2
know how to: 2
closed the door: 2
and may tend: 2
and said can: 2
the boy that: 2
many triplets as: 2
allow me to: 2
find a first-year: 2
the back of: 2
the sort of: 2
me to demonstrate: 2
of her mind: 2
opened her mouth: 2
she couldn't think: 2
just by snapping: 2
hermione took the: 2
a dangerous sort: 2
hermione looked at: 2
she tried to: 2
close the door: 2
something about the: 1
the other thing: 1
me with my: 1
started its rise: 1
to do you: 1
reason wanted to: 1
were like 'let's: 1
have to take: 1
she said at: 1
didn't feel like: 1
shriek and ran: 1
that and neville: 1
i just said: 1
- harry potter: 1
to learn to: 1
neville looked like: 1
of the things: 1
do anything just: 1
so 'any three: 1
dumbledore sent you: 1
eyes were quite: 1
page from here: 1
display my answer: 1
boy reached into: 1
were his colors: 1
looking for is: 1
order lowest to: 1
of boy who: 1
but those are: 1
potter closed the: 1
assume that if: 1
it was still: 1
choked and coughed: 1
in books actually: 1
days ago then: 1
he was holding: 1
him he knocked: 1
step farther out: 1
bullied in the: 1
book told you: 1
harry potter snapped: 1
of spells figure: 1
a real seer: 1
actually benefit from: 1
wondering when i: 1
from a live: 1
gotten the schoolbooks: 1
done so many: 1
the fear is: 1
knock at the: 1
you would don't: 1
didn't hear the: 1
and mean since: 1
ha ha have: 1
said just as: 1
wondered if hanging: 1
it couldn't be: 1
still looked neutral: 1
a rather smug: 1
dark lord he-who-must-not-be-named: 1
been the rule: 1
thinking the boy: 1
again well maybe: 1
easily been the: 1
looking for you: 1
toward her and: 1
what would be: 1
as possible that: 1
at the train: 1
the horizon and: 1
oil of sharpness: 1
my fans and: 1
to him had: 1
of a gryffindor: 1
colors harry potter: 1
which fits the: 1
little sad inside: 1
voice said not: 1
farther out and: 1
shrieking something about: 1
by sitting down: 1
was actually the: 1
and an odd: 1
quietly it was: 1
this car have: 1
boy you asked: 1
of experimenting and: 1
it to the: 1
acromantula silk after: 1
like he was: 1
easy could it: 1
have to we'll: 1
to whatever it: 1
not unless you: 1
sure what she: 1
do the books: 1
said hermione i: 1
was feeling or: 1
the secret of: 1
cabin so you're: 1
she wasn't quite: 1
pouch and said: 1
noise well well: 1
who's survived the: 1
the soda had: 1
fear you but: 1
and then the: 1
she hadn't thought: 1
my prediction is: 1
his and hermione: 1
handle a trick: 1
all really the: 1
potter turned his: 1
to do science: 1
entire life that: 1
slithered along after: 1
voice you're one: 1
was not charmed: 1
satisfaction and sat: 1
scar on your: 1
her but that: 1
them clean which: 1
it takes to: 1
harry potter meant: 1
said hermione i'd: 1
could have just: 1
as confused as: 1
the robes and: 1
his height and: 1
taken the initiative: 1
whisper 'go away': 1
to him even: 1
lot more special: 1
rule say 'yes': 1
to you -: 1
resent the boy's: 1
sirius black though: 1
mind was now: 1
boy hermione tried: 1
to this but: 1
never seen before: 1
was the sound: 1
of annoyance in: 1
the cabin but: 1
miss the toad: 1
here all right: 1
said triumphantly yes: 1
granger i just: 1
cloudless dawn sky: 1
to make her: 1
hermione go 4-6-8: 1
name is hermione: 1
silver n-no his: 1
widely now then: 1
boy apparently people: 1
took the paper: 1
his trunk scurried: 1
well one of: 1
missed then suddenly: 1
when should the: 1
in the stomach: 1
by death eaters: 1
looking quite silly: 1
initiative by sitting: 1
she'd never seen: 1
and she did: 1
was actually crying: 1
explore the galaxy: 1
exactly i have: 1
it means that: 1
like at all: 1
i can't seem: 1
dark arts claims: 1
at hogwarts he'd: 1
about so let: 1
all terrible and: 1
as he feared: 1
a 'yes' if: 1
his head from: 1
same amount each: 1
called 'positive bias': 1
example of a: 1
they'd just gone: 1
them but in: 1
a saying that: 1
the consequences hermione: 1
same size even: 1
the cabin nodded: 1
banana hermione was: 1
the door of: 1
quiz and counter-quiz: 1
over his head: 1
me that luna: 1
the moving scenery: 1
chief warlock albus: 1
lily evans on: 1
you had a: 1
now the boy's: 1
and i don't: 1
thought to suggest: 1
too much suddenly: 1
be stained and: 1
when you've performed: 1
asking the wrong: 1
since you say: 1
just now all: 1
poor small boy: 1
whether it looks: 1
2-4-6 is one: 1
trunk said the: 1
her head it's: 1
we're at hogwarts: 1
something on yourself: 1
hermione smiled rather: 1
to a child: 1
looked down if: 1
then the realization: 1
in no time: 1
robes to make: 1
odd reason no: 1
thinking but she: 1
but they might: 1
like dad always: 1
to interfere at: 1
them - the: 1
like she'd never: 1
always complains about: 1
for a change: 1
close you have: 1
something but but: 1
to keep them: 1
spoke was cold: 1
the way it: 1
a 'yes' when: 1
i infer from: 1
little too inhibited: 1
at least know: 1
herself of course: 1
guess the rule: 1
finally made the: 1
of the boy's: 1
burst out hermione: 1
in fact you: 1
for them to: 1
heard him say: 1
impossible that sounded: 1
was she'd just: 1
everything good evening: 1
life that she'd: 1
and yet somehow: 1
skipped gears ground: 1
so scary that: 1
where the rise: 1
question the question: 1
scared little boy: 1
i know it's: 1
first-years that did: 1
results step 4: 1
the sun first: 1
was betrayed by: 1
or volume 1: 1
so how could: 1
have to go: 1
on them to: 1
it occurred to: 1
stain will disappear: 1
opening her mouth: 1
mouth again and: 1
been able to: 1
toad we're only: 1
just walk up: 1
the real test: 1
put into the: 1
it do more: 1
she'd read about: 1
out the underlying: 1
k rowling's except: 1
publication like dad: 1
sound of an: 1
had to say: 1
sort of got: 1
first he was: 1
of cognitive science: 1
we were doing: 1
thought of herself: 1
to make the: 1
say something utterly: 1
book and it: 1
ha have some: 1
you but great: 1
product of a: 1
towels in your: 1
why are you: 1
the solar system: 1
into the wall: 1
get that it: 1
and looked out: 1
all the further: 1
by a weak: 1
sort of thirsty: 1
voice i'm neville: 1
but bystander apathy: 1
set in a: 1
give him some: 1
for several minutes: 1
granger up down: 1
soda on the: 1
told you to: 1
the answer -: 1
as wonderful as: 1
gratitude hold on: 1
i didn't see: 1
line his voice: 1
you want to: 1
of the whole: 1
you read the: 1
me that soda: 1
only once but: 1
of thirsty by: 1
can unfold the: 1
help me do: 1
other boy -: 1
the book back: 1
sheet of paper: 1
was cold and: 1
on neville i'll: 1
tone when he: 1
something about light: 1
as though this: 1
for a bit: 1
merge the wizarding: 1
she was scared: 1
the boy's smile: 1
been sitting down: 1
of the rule: 1
in case someone: 1
in the silk: 1
burning fire of: 1
said how much: 1
i've read the: 1
love of being: 1
you're asking how: 1
stay harry potter: 1
shook her head: 1
hastily to her: 1
charmed and you: 1
standard of living: 1
turned into a: 1
that could falsify: 1
come true and: 1
dealing with all: 1
that would make: 1
her looked inside: 1
and sat down: 1
in the cabin: 1
primary engines sputtered: 1
silence in the: 1
robe being charmed: 1
the cupholder at: 1
it started to: 1
research hermione granger: 1
- she didn't: 1
those it was: 1
hopefully he won't: 1
way to do: 1
the empty bench: 1
it seemed like: 1
while to check: 1
vanished but that: 1
she heard him: 1
read-through of hogwarts: 1
the entire planet's: 1
then the sound: 1
properly read history: 1
performed only 20: 1
bring magic into: 1
and within just: 1
then it was: 1
true and that: 1
some other girl: 1
wand or say: 1
opened the book: 1
change in my: 1
by hand and: 1
annoying i haven't: 1
grew to three: 1
apart the whole: 1
she seemed to: 1
accepted the soda: 1
a scientist in: 1
times counterclockwise and: 1
of my laws: 1
i'm not evil: 1
grin widely under: 1
on a famous: 1
to take another: 1
back i remember: 1
a good way: 1
did do you: 1
realizing it earlier: 1
have spent the: 1
rule it's sort: 1
said harry potter: 1
went to the: 1
the answer from: 1
retrieving a bright: 1
history and the: 1
train by hand: 1
thank you very: 1
his trunk -: 1
and gold red: 1
his face neutral: 1
we have to: 1
indignation that was: 1
the boy blinked: 1
seemed sensible to: 1
- just in: 1
she so loved: 1
performed all the: 1
do more good: 1
little whisper 'go: 1
the soda no: 1
just heard even: 1
at the original: 1
is always a: 1
thirty-five years hermione: 1
evil the boy: 1
to tell them: 1
who could actually: 1
nodded allow me: 1
one who's survived: 1
would give candy: 1
hermione i'd have: 1
was as confused: 1
history no one: 1
stab of disappointment: 1
useful sort of: 1
question is did: 1
pouch so i: 1
boy stuck a: 1
somehow if there: 1
long pause hermione: 1
felt like kicking: 1
times its former: 1
indignation do i: 1
doesn't say how: 1
i've never actually: 1
come from a: 1
had asked for: 1
maybe i'll let: 1
worlds are j: 1
again nope no: 1
the boy raised: 1
scenery well she: 1
ridiculous the whole: 1
soda onto the: 1
she would have: 1
great confidence in: 1
two each time: 1
wasn't some request: 1
in her hand: 1
except europa attempt: 1
at the can: 1
slid back to: 1
to be friends: 1
suppose i tell: 1
and looking quite: 1
hermione stared at: 1
she had more: 1
part where she: 1
widened you're harry: 1
seat said the: 1
about the boy: 1
rather gingerly poured: 1
first time she'd: 1
cabin eek my: 1
it doesn't vanish: 1
trick yes said: 1
one had seemed: 1
have you seen: 1
was rather a: 1
bit of experimenting: 1
that was secondary: 1
tried to concentrate: 1
we were undead: 1
a confusing phenomenon: 1
called the boy-who-lived: 1
boy's oh-so-superior tone: 1
could she do: 1
about your robes: 1
a triplet which: 1
is often worse: 1
wasn't as wonderful: 1
didn't even think: 1
was not sad: 1
let it be: 1
from me said: 1
to drink he: 1
think she could: 1
what do you: 1
by the time: 1
the first place: 1
it's sort of: 1
and it slid: 1
him you were: 1
on but that's: 1
like kicking herself: 1
potter-evans-verres or harry: 1
quick question she: 1
my clothes don't: 1
you hermione although: 1
boy's smile faded: 1
of you-know-who's body: 1
seer she said: 1
there were two: 1
stare into the: 1
me professor mcgonagall: 1
sound that sounded: 1
and closing hermione: 1
judgment under uncertainty: 1
didn't want to: 1
been trying to: 1
anything finally he: 1
without my help: 1
question hermione opened: 1
you survived because: 1
to reveal neville: 1
wrong responses that: 1
into the darkness: 1
my robes will: 1
the book his: 1
me what's going: 1
won't entertain any: 1
red-dark scar set: 1
like a compulsion: 1
temple or something: 1
power in his: 1
each time it: 1
a pancake she: 1
to concentrate she: 1
suddenly she thought: 1
corner of the: 1
which to say: 1
this is blatantly: 1
any reason wanted: 1
magic items that: 1
wrong question the: 1
oh well what: 1
can just do: 1
me that this: 1
was sort of: 1
granger's mind flashed: 1
the boy closed: 1
suppose harry potter: 1
boy raised his: 1
in your pouch: 1
your home whose: 1
fluid was still: 1
train hermione laid: 1
angry red-dark scar: 1
did now the: 1
mean i think: 1
answer right and: 1
course i'm in: 1
it was she'd: 1
p-prefect but he: 1
in rather the: 1
solemnly he was: 1
bottom draco mpreg: 1
oddly disturbing fashion: 1
anything else to: 1
she'd ever wanted: 1
take out her: 1
full throttle have: 1
child neville's eyes: 1
hypothesis is that: 1
but hermione stammered: 1
for that then: 1
that finding some: 1
train screw by: 1
came up with: 1
i have spent: 1
way this game: 1
reading a book: 1
know a spell: 1
whole business of: 1
miss granger a: 1
the boy wasn't: 1
yet it couldn't: 1
her aside from: 1
doesn't bite me: 1
though this were: 1
that did make: 1
i never he: 1
thought and action: 1
to someone and: 1
if you're asking: 1
interrupted by a: 1
kings and those: 1
of him was: 1
them only once: 1
another timid knock: 1
charmed and not: 1
boy 10-12-14 said: 1
first-year's toad isn't: 1
held them off: 1
give me a: 1
strange charm truth: 1
adults ever help: 1
you feel necessary: 1
rule say 'no': 1
whole train screw: 1
magic at his: 1
loved tests go: 1
to scare you: 1
ahead discover the: 1
doesn't work i: 1
now suppose i: 1
reviewer asked whether: 1
choice in an: 1
arts claims that: 1
mind and you: 1
real answer is: 1
a gryffindor prefect: 1
of her pocket: 1
about i didn't: 1
quite silly with: 1
say before opening: 1
was odd about: 1
measuring the results: 1
wrong all right: 1
brief pattering of: 1
she wished some: 1
she'd met someone: 1
alone on the: 1
other experiment could: 1
wandless magic at: 1
invent fantastically complicated: 1
felt that way: 1
was still there: 1
potter for short: 1
she was beginning: 1
to three times: 1
a potion of: 1
potter was the: 1
counter-quiz went on: 1
saw him he: 1
then i think: 1
with my research: 1
don't have to: 1
her whole entire: 1
when there were: 1
one foot taller: 1
didn't seem to: 1
her and neville: 1
out her own: 1
going by his: 1
voice full of: 1
the boy-who-lived you: 1
you'll - then: 1
a hand and: 1
supposed to do: 1
realized with a: 1
one who gave: 1
she just sat: 1
and i've read: 1
on came the: 1
haven't done step: 1
neville's hand in: 1
of the sun: 1
an ancient temple: 1
this was a: 1
the rule just: 1
something to say: 1
should like to: 1
likely that i'm: 1
james potter-evans-verres or: 1
sweating underneath her: 1
with that thinking: 1
my intelligence then: 1
much hermione said: 1

with was what: 1
i won't entertain: 1
the lines of: 1
yes whispered the: 1
that your scar: 1

boy said in: 1
in she and: 1
by the window: 1
i needed to: 1
fingers it came: 1
see why do: 1
it on my: 1
rush of euphoria: 1
to change in: 1
was greeted by: 1
kept hiccuping in: 1
i could leave: 1
i can the: 1
lot of sense: 1
to be interrupted: 1
4 make a: 1
potions by arsenius: 1
if this doesn't: 1
help me take: 1
the boy tilted: 1
give you another: 1
spat that finding: 1
it was holding: 1
cabin and he: 1
hermione was as: 1
think you have: 1
hermione said who: 1
a test or: 1
disturbing fashion please: 1
do hermione said: 1
not enough and: 1
she didn't feel: 1
quite clear that: 1
good if you: 1
feynman lectures or: 1
when i can: 1
to find out: 1
euphoria but she: 1
or second year: 1
days buying science: 1
gone with them: 1
at least thirty-five: 1
and a lot: 1
little punch in: 1
or where i: 1
someone from inside: 1
granger i ah: 1
first becomes visible: 1
head a small: 1
it and rejected: 1
and modern magical: 1
rereading hogwarts a: 1
boy have a: 1
this spell to: 1
but in just: 1
trailed off awkwardly: 1
to remember how: 1
its rise to: 1
a tightly folded: 1
now there's a: 1
a weak tentative: 1
how it will: 1
his worst nightmare: 1
it was also: 1
not others 2-4-6: 1
didn't see you: 1
wrong way allow: 1
measuring weighing quality: 1
around angered if: 1
in your own: 1
his scarf ah: 1
walked over to: 1
book his trunk: 1
you know not: 1
james potter and: 1
i could if: 1
interrupted by another: 1
even think she: 1
j k rowling's: 1
that means this: 1
to find it: 1
door of another: 1
our faces darken: 1
are gryffindor's colors: 1
they'd been trying: 1
be nightmares involving: 1
book with a: 1
test hermione shut: 1
can i help: 1
horrible monsters who: 1
at herself hermione: 1
onto a corner: 1
- hermione's mind: 1
was sweating underneath: 1
sun first becomes: 1
her mind you're: 1
mind was starting: 1
front car where: 1
at her incredulously: 1
the robes are: 1
small burping noise: 1
photographic i've always: 1
of being bullied: 1
with them but: 1
and stood up: 1
and neville flinch: 1
help she wished: 1
was look for: 1
always felt like: 1
way you don't: 1
i do said: 1
and i'll tell: 1
out what and: 1
now she had: 1
rather rereading hogwarts: 1
all the responsibility: 1
to do is: 1
to do it: 1
wanting to show: 1
friends with you: 1
for my pet: 1
train with the: 1
bowed to her: 1
question wrong and: 1
making oil of: 1
boy's expression grew: 1
and rejected the: 1
doesn't work i'll: 1
her helpfulness kicked: 1
spoke rather dryly: 1
boy and do: 1
you did hermione: 1
not wanting to: 1
vanished eureka hermione: 1
dawn sky 8: 1
the book he'd: 1
test and she'd: 1
trunk which she: 1
him say -: 1
in the crowd: 1
awful that poor: 1
open she was: 1
case that was: 1
confirm their hypotheses: 1
pocket and she: 1
from seeing his: 1
you give me: 1
who'd abandon a: 1
happen just by: 1
boy hesitated what: 1
of green soda: 1
be bothered over: 1
have an experiment: 1
rather odd feeling: 1
to answer that: 1
i've always wished: 1
the testing she: 1
in a weak: 1
than 72 hours: 1
from her own: 1
tell them -: 1
to wait for: 1
of those pouches: 1
her solemnly he: 1
to somewhere in: 1
i did something: 1
well said hermione: 1
take the paper: 1
bathroom wait here: 1
tinge of annoyance: 1
all right the: 1
work and elbow: 1
the boy waited: 1
cylinder he held: 1
needed our help: 1
them all really: 1
she'd automatically put: 1
walk toward her: 1
and quite enjoying: 1
napkins said the: 1
remember how long: 1
the ensuing quiz: 1
right - she: 1
brand new never-worn: 1
hermione granger up: 1
but great wizarding: 1
down if you: 1
pocket and unfolded: 1
that he'd given: 1
measure the results: 1
bayesian probability theory: 1
talk to her: 1
intelligence and rationality: 1
boy was now: 1
back she hadn't: 1
feeling the boy: 1
an odd slithering: 1
until that one: 1
was also at: 1
then the boy's: 1
had a chocolate: 1
needed and yet: 1
scarf so can: 1
of see what: 1
and i know: 1
would make it: 1
triplets that should: 1
even though part: 1
from him all: 1
has turned exactly: 1
schoolbooks three days: 1
confusion every time: 1
mother's love and: 1
what do the: 1
into a pouch: 1
stuck a hand: 1
boy's eyebrows lifted: 1
and fold it: 1
i certainly agree: 1
this meant she: 1
was actually rather: 1
- which fits: 1
pancake she wasn't: 1
about light planting: 1
the world there: 1
looked exactly like: 1
trying to imagine: 1
her own in: 1
your pocket and: 1
look at her: 1
between the robe: 1
how to say: 1
done step 2: 1
it looks bad: 1
the boy-who-lived stood: 1
the door sliding: 1
see what happens: 1
still asking for: 1
that's charmed it: 1
but you didn't: 1
step 4 make: 1
she gasped and: 1
started to drink: 1
height and looking: 1
if they're not: 1
be in trouble: 1
calculus and i: 1
the boy's oh-so-superior: 1
looked down at: 1
in the last: 1
you please don't: 1
the feynman lectures: 1
then her helpfulness: 1
turned and looked: 1
as hermione started: 1
and i'll give: 1
her own age: 1
robes probably first: 1
are the consequences: 1
escher bach and: 1
you've performed all: 1
and we might: 1
boy coughed no: 1
more surreal no: 1
that poor boy: 1
a game based: 1
move humanity centuries: 1
that the only: 1
want to conduct: 1
toad i i: 1
born to james: 1
experiment could she: 1
was holding a: 1
once but it: 1
a proposition miss: 1
explain to me: 1
after him technically: 1
had to find: 1
he'd named instantly: 1
quite sure about: 1
of i can't: 1
without giving away: 1
remembered what she'd: 1
but there's nowhere: 1
disappear and the: 1
it wasn't as: 1
mouth to say: 1
was scared of: 1
first but bystander: 1
some people in: 1
have some paper: 1
new never-worn witch's: 1
suspect was rather: 1
boy looked at: 1
felt like a: 1
first place and: 1
and he closed: 1
have to increase: 1
for a first-year: 1
the scarfed face: 1
quite teach you: 1
smiling again at: 1
soda in fact: 1
at it trying: 1
i have napkins: 1
would be tested: 1
hypothesis that the: 1
have to learn: 1
sitting down reading: 1
already unwinding the: 1
though i don't: 1
bolt harry potter: 1
was still asking: 1
never-worn witch's robes: 1
to say something: 1
things like m-missing: 1
you about something: 1
they knew it: 1
was feeling a: 1
the first time: 1
hermione shut her: 1
frantic footsteps and: 1
with or without: 1
wished she wouldn't: 1
science merge the: 1
against itself and: 1
tentative faint rather: 1
well maybe this: 1
to worry about: 1
soda if this: 1
properly well enough: 1
checked all the: 1
i'll come with: 1
me do the: 1
there's nowhere for: 1
to vanish and: 1
out that hogwarts: 1
since i went: 1
reached into his: 1
to look on: 1
that the robe: 1
or without my: 1
did you do: 1
shot at the: 1
mind but right: 1
have what it: 1
rose dramatically i: 1
book back into: 1
there but even: 1
rule - known: 1
intelligence then said: 1
probability theory and: 1
a chocolate frog: 1
about to be: 1
can see that: 1
left she probably: 1
tilted the book: 1
to rub some: 1
a question wrong: 1
head from the: 1
she'd already done: 1
out what she'd: 1
issue now is: 1
negative side of: 1
that always felt: 1
awkward to go: 1
it came just: 1
her and she: 1
mistake but it's: 1
side and said: 1
robes will be: 1
brian dumbledore sent: 1
a bit rhetorically: 1
a strange thought: 1
confusing phenomenon i: 1
did wrong this: 1
a science fair: 1
that's not enough: 1
you know exactly: 1
exactly like he: 1
too awkward to: 1
harry potter you: 1
to say before: 1
are and asked: 1
hermione realized the: 1
and language in: 1
rational choice in: 1
i see why: 1
three numbers but: 1
twentieth century it: 1
almost everything you: 1
anyway and judgment: 1
the things -: 1
then we'll just: 1
who would proudly: 1
didn't get a: 1
were in books: 1
secondary to finding: 1
light planting a: 1
attacked by death: 1
done wrong all: 1
wasn't sure what: 1
up with this: 1
to be bothered: 1
history warns that: 1
did at least: 1
hermione said since: 1
numbers but not: 1
sort of books: 1
done giving him: 1
won't quite teach: 1
try to rub: 1
boy you probably: 1
paper and mechanical: 1
the hand containing: 1
brain kept hiccuping: 1
been empty in: 1
on the negative: 1
screamed it was: 1
at his age: 1
the scarf from: 1
he t-told me: 1
and i believe: 1
burping noise well: 1
school books five: 1
hard work and: 1
do long division: 1
people involved why: 1
look for you: 1
the next ingredient: 1
have you checked: 1
what are the: 1
hermione's mind went: 1
hand send the: 1
asking for like: 1
apparently people who: 1
8 degrees from: 1
miss hermione granger: 1
liar but when: 1
r-red and gold: 1
the cardboard display: 1
go up to: 1
did looks all: 1
fantastically complicated hypotheses: 1
please close the: 1
want to pour: 1
my face too: 1
to really get: 1
the soda and: 1
over to her: 1
or why she: 1
future that's called: 1
i want happen: 1
interesting and the: 1
and lowered the: 1
the boy reached: 1
fact you didn't: 1
doesn't work my: 1
you're awful that: 1
hermione's jaw dropped: 1
am nature the: 1
attention first we'll: 1
other compartments yes: 1
a compulsion she: 1
my answer is: 1
woman next to: 1
little boy and: 1
unwinding the scarf: 1
though it doesn't: 1
rule is that: 1
out a sigh: 1
and practice and: 1
so many experiments: 1
had the distinct: 1
greeted by a: 1
boy that way: 1
is one of: 1
hadn't thought to: 1
truth beauty and: 1
just seeing that: 1
you understand the: 1
of an ancient: 1
world and the: 1
fixed rule and: 1
candy i'd bought: 1
but but hermione: 1
thought of something: 1
wizard's dress robes: 1
can read upside-down: 1
understand the game: 1
might have spells: 1
to hogwarts or: 1
boy-who-lived stood up: 1
looked at it: 1
she saw him: 1
from the window: 1
at the general: 1
if he went: 1
stammered what did: 1
continuing her third: 1
took on a: 1
magical history and: 1
wait of course: 1
1-3-5 yes minus: 1
jigger when he: 1
the toad anyway: 1
lad who could: 1
desensitization therapy by: 1
love and that: 1
wrong with that: 1
into life even: 1
survived because of: 1
surreal i'm not: 1
have spare robes: 1
about hermione granger: 1
wait that's not: 1
and then i: 1
did she have: 1
swung around angered: 1
thought she saw: 1
you checked all: 1
with you this: 1
the boy 10-12-14: 1
to sit down: 1
triumphantly yes 10-20-30: 1
two days buying: 1
time it doesn't: 1
of sound that: 1
the boy spoke: 1
we didn't find: 1
to look at: 1
help to have: 1
it for you: 1
to conduct experimental: 1
was the soda: 1
the very very: 1
'positive bias' said: 1
from the store: 1
wasn't as bad: 1
to the prefects': 1
the robe being: 1
pet toad i: 1
bench across from: 1
about what scientists: 1
to check the: 1
hogwarts no less: 1
and this is: 1
- what you: 1
the can of: 1
prefect come on: 1
not quite said: 1
theory and decision: 1
which was odd: 1
quarks or tell: 1
fair project step: 1
if you would: 1
of soda in: 1
her hand halted: 1
she didn't hear: 1
uncertainty heuristics and: 1
one of my: 1
in full throttle: 1
there was the: 1
how much science: 1
test what other: 1
had an odd: 1
then she looked: 1
it looks and: 1
was measuring the: 1
a teacher but: 1
of being tested: 1
but when she: 1
thin line his: 1
his voice when: 1
do calculus and: 1
we were like: 1
anywhere on this: 1
less the boy: 1
very first day: 1
books what a: 1
have any arguments: 1
and blur like: 1
wouldn't have felt: 1
boy who was: 1
have to decide: 1
you have some: 1
she was still: 1
you've just discovered: 1
the book to: 1
hogwarts she felt: 1
smug sort of: 1
in one of: 1
coughed and expelled: 1
to me what's: 1
moment she loved: 1
couldn't be that: 1
there was something: 1
if i test: 1
the word you're: 1
three times i'm: 1
you seen my: 1
just a trick: 1
the centaurs fear: 1
steamroller and turned: 1
of crackpot theories: 1
of the lords: 1
crowd who wanted: 1
she wasn't dealing: 1
given what you've: 1
my trunk said: 1
science and i've: 1
experiment is performed: 1
mouth wide open: 1
was something wrong: 1
leaned forward and: 1
sad inside maybe: 1
to diagon alley: 1
me candy what: 1
do is to: 1
then she couldn't: 1
she loved being: 1
of the few: 1
possible that should: 1
is hermione granger: 1
the boy grin: 1
try to think: 1
wordless wandless magic: 1
this instead then: 1
neville flinch i: 1
you about me: 1
the soda all: 1
expelled the bright: 1
were nearly the: 1
boy walked over: 1
me write down: 1
this boy thought: 1
peculiar you're looking: 1
i did looks: 1
minutes before being: 1
think we can: 1
he'd given what: 1
dress robes probably: 1
turned his head: 1
he said voice: 1
candy to a: 1
granger that she: 1
magical power in: 1
you have cast: 1
i i need: 1
she couldn't just: 1
was going the: 1
told you about: 1
ruins of your: 1
the boy stared: 1
what and there: 1
but then she: 1
boy that this: 1
to you for: 1
my trunk too: 1
doesn't have to: 1
to go the: 1
i saw this: 1
is harry james: 1
off shrieking something: 1
little further afield: 1
still had the: 1
you how to: 1
to keep themselves: 1
kind of twisty: 1
that she couldn't: 1
what if he: 1
asked me to: 1
guessed right about: 1
about something but: 1
and you kept: 1
feeling of something: 1
sort of villain: 1
alley and discovered: 1
of a test: 1
right now she: 1
harry potter -: 1
starting to resent: 1
studies of spells: 1
jamming it into: 1
i have spare: 1
and dancing around: 1
boy grin widely: 1
like her but: 1
warns that there: 1
realized why the: 1
fic i regret: 1
not the robe: 1
of your mother's: 1
just said you: 1
phenomenon i hermione's: 1
house near the: 1
the teacher told: 1
science books believe: 1
to her own: 1
hermione said there: 1
this game works: 1
not sad lonely: 1
know the six: 1
way it means: 1
learn to look: 1
to take all: 1
under uncertainty heuristics: 1
few moments it: 1
scared of being: 1
a frightening sort: 1
doesn't vanish do: 1
but suppose all: 1
who would give: 1
of sharpness -: 1
and turned into: 1
had a rule: 1
potion of spider: 1
before the tip: 1
him was enough: 1
grinning very widely: 1
sort of girl: 1
stood on the: 1
think of something: 1
his forehead that: 1
opened the door: 1
to cast her: 1
- and after: 1
george came up: 1
and she rather: 1
something like that: 1
herself as a: 1
i make it: 1
your forehead in: 1
she looked at: 1
or something now: 1
of something in: 1
laws bring magic: 1
fire of indignation: 1
already done a: 1
was built over: 1
around talking eating: 1
reluctant knocking at: 1
dancing around him: 1
political power 'the: 1
and many of: 1
further experimental tests: 1
life even though: 1
coming down the: 1
had never seemed: 1
up next to: 1
word you're looking: 1
results but in: 1
the distinct feeling: 1
she shut her: 1
have felt that: 1
hand which she'd: 1
the stain will: 1
blur like we: 1
of an inter-train: 1
hermione granger's mind: 1
how i know: 1
discovered is called: 1
she had the: 1
i i can't: 1
universe hermione finished: 1
maybe gryffindor wasn't: 1
the rule it's: 1
a corner of: 1
down reading a: 1
you if you: 1
infer from earlier: 1
that is the: 1
yes the real: 1
of her did: 1
eidetic memory hermione: 1
the material was: 1
luna might be: 1
arsenius jigger when: 1
investigating me you: 1
boy closed his: 1
the boy-who-lived gets: 1
works i have: 1
you with something: 1
can you please: 1
girl would just: 1
already on them: 1
still fresh in: 1
drink and lowered: 1
hermione was in: 1
opening and then: 1
science properly well: 1
influence science and: 1
a seat said: 1
run over by: 1
had never let: 1
your wand or: 1
so you're a: 1
prefect for help: 1
money ha ha: 1
you know the: 1
neville was actually: 1
ran away there: 1
i'm glad to: 1
put the book: 1
to her looked: 1
to smile hermione: 1
now all right: 1
frog stain disappeared: 1
1 was to: 1
'yes' but you: 1
she cast her: 1
talked this was: 1
up with was: 1
of hogwarts a: 1
the boy do: 1
we'll take apart: 1
impossible which is: 1
the store with: 1
mean since it: 1
potter i've sort: 1
- i can: 1
it was at: 1
3 measure the: 1
i'll tell you: 1
said who told: 1
hpdm bottom draco: 1
do remember this: 1
at almost the: 1
couldn't just sit: 1
more harm than: 1
act is right: 1
boy blinked three: 1
out what the: 1
a scared little: 1
on the first: 1
doesn't mean anything: 1
answer - what: 1
him had gone: 1
the boy stood: 1
you the boy: 1
as a take-charge: 1
i know some: 1
find a grownup: 1
science fair project: 1
down the rule: 1
charmed it was: 1
what she'd never: 1
know why she: 1
in books what: 1
there's a saying: 1
ought to know: 1
scarves over our: 1
show my face: 1
his fingers you'll: 1
left open just: 1
trunk stood on: 1
shy person she: 1
imputation that this: 1
the boy-who-lived's face: 1
to say no: 1
he might faint: 1
hermione frowned what: 1
that ffn does: 1
boy after a: 1
rotten cheating liar: 1
a test like: 1
onto her brand: 1
over to memorize: 1
just so you: 1
boy i can: 1
lightning bolt harry: 1
to her solemnly: 1
little silly for: 1
has nightmares about: 1
i can't remember: 1
experiment hermione smiled: 1
you the boy's: 1
the wrong way: 1
hermione said as: 1
her cabin and: 1
i want you: 1
it right hermione: 1
he was looking: 1
out of her: 1
right with or: 1
first or second: 1
to read my: 1
with a small: 1
yes hermione couldn't: 1
let me try: 1
she didn't know: 1
red and gold: 1
the product of: 1
sounded a bit: 1
looks all terrible: 1
doing and then: 1
did was mean: 1
very very best: 1
up by the: 1
what it takes: 1
reply to whatever: 1
this test is: 1
a charm on: 1
that you can: 1
by whether it: 1
you 'yes' if: 1
went directly to: 1
you stop and: 1
and it was: 1
the darkness when: 1
worry about your: 1
from here you: 1
research there was: 1
since it seemed: 1
others invent fantastically: 1
still feeling the: 1
don't worry i: 1
neglected the part: 1
even the first: 1
tried the boy: 1
hermione realized with: 1
but let it: 1

pouch which swallowed: 1
then sat down: 1
if it was: 1

that this boy: 1
tested it and: 1
back she couldn't: 1

have happened just: 1
if we have: 1
going to be: 1
how they knew: 1
to be an: 1
unless you read: 1
the dark lord: 1
then she thought: 1
looked at the: 1
only if it: 1
of hard work: 1
no point in: 1
on this car: 1
potter you no: 1
depressed despairing or: 1
to listen to: 1
this before frantically: 1
with unnecessary force: 1
in the future: 1
that stop her: 1

spare robes in: 1

of any wrong: 1
closed cabin and: 1
is settled i: 1
he appeared when: 1
me but not: 1
to do her: 1
thought of a: 1
well what happened: 1
the shock was: 1
a train-car door: 1
start recruiting my: 1
could you have: 1
her hypothesis when: 1
firmly as he: 1
was to form: 1
she thought better: 1
importantly figure out: 1
let me write: 1
said there was: 1
and asked a: 1
you have to: 1
all the candy: 1
and everything came: 1
your hypothesis step: 1
exactly the shade: 1
the light burning: 1
find out that: 1
said can of: 1
soda not vanish: 1
black though it: 1
spilled anything at: 1
minus 1 positive: 1
to resent the: 1
sat down next: 1
people imagine experiments: 1
hiccup that they: 1
but as the: 1
can i've never: 1
eureka hermione said: 1
centaurs fear you: 1
his hand and: 1
can all safely: 1
what i did: 1
elbow grease so: 1
until they saw: 1
said that young: 1
full well said: 1
stared at her: 1
soda had taken: 1
across from her: 1
found that out: 1
72 hours since: 1
like m-missing toads: 1
want - asked: 1
that or not: 1
your scar contains: 1
being bullied in: 1
paper put this: 1
if harry potter: 1
know everything good: 1
of herself as: 1
and that your: 1
which she was: 1
actually sort of: 1
screamed and ran: 1
all screamed and: 1
come from the: 1
green soda onto: 1
herself when there: 1
that this test: 1
thank you i'm: 1
the voice of: 1
lips set in: 1
cardboard display my: 1
want to be: 1
from around his: 1
take a while: 1
just a little: 1
already done all: 1
say how they: 1
scare you her: 1
suddenly neville gasped: 1
faint with gratitude: 1
'trust but verify': 1
way allow me: 1
exactly the same: 1
didn't like at: 1
along the boy: 1
a small trunk: 1
times i'm in: 1
- well one: 1
because i know: 1
i don't need: 1
certainly agree that: 1
your mother's love: 1
it's close you: 1
alert reviewer asked: 1
1 form a: 1
entire planet's standard: 1
was around one-third: 1
this was quite: 1
angered if harry: 1
by arsenius jigger: 1
dropped she had: 1
on his forehead: 1
else to do: 1
anything spilled on: 1
stomach it said: 1
time i warn: 1
tested on those: 1
not charmed and: 1
what why not: 1
was like a: 1
as always interpreted: 1
she would be: 1
least until they: 1
short i know: 1
me said hermione: 1
as you feel: 1
1 yes hermione: 1
again at the: 1
say i was: 1
unnecessary force she: 1
a prefect for: 1
confused to do: 1
power 'the effecting: 1
certain silence in: 1
of indignation do: 1
to think about: 1
history and stood: 1
please don't look: 1
sort of charm: 1
and hermione swung: 1
the underlying laws: 1
she didn't even: 1
he left she: 1
it though i: 1
- the ensuing: 1
of paper put: 1
footsteps and an: 1
own in an: 1
well said the: 1
experimental studies of: 1
that cabin door: 1
it 1-3-5 yes: 1
there are three: 1
in their wrong: 1
disappeared rather than: 1
whole train by: 1
gossiped for whatever: 1
worthy of a: 1
harry potter hissed: 1
of paper and: 1
to the whole: 1
wearing the scarf: 1
me said the: 1
place and felt: 1
magical item from: 1
it was around: 1
you or invite: 1
and action and: 1
toad isn't heroic: 1
her hand which: 1
and she felt: 1
vanish all right: 1
somewhere no one: 1
which still had: 1
- i'll have: 1
face neutral but: 1
say 'no' in: 1
burnt remains of: 1
actually screamed it: 1
was speaking a: 1
and said i'm: 1
find out everything: 1
angry is your: 1
answer that they: 1
on yourself earlier: 1
tested but she'd: 1
how to meet: 1
paper and see: 1
you're called the: 1
than asking for: 1
you but as: 1
turned so scary: 1
around him and: 1
going - and: 1
mind back she: 1
and great wizarding: 1
might cry and: 1
going to take: 1
then you can: 1
decide whether to: 1
wonderful as she: 1
sat down hard: 1
but i think: 1
and looked down: 1
believe me i: 1
underlying laws bring: 1
important things to: 1
she stared at: 1
you to join: 1
bright laughing green: 1
bias' said the: 1
held it out: 1
did hermione took: 1
because he didn't: 1
you her hand: 1
meant she couldn't: 1
hand halted on: 1
than the thing: 1
involving horrible monsters: 1
triplets of three: 1
three numbers' could: 1
make you a: 1
were done giving: 1
and found a: 1
and flinched back: 1
onto the floor: 1
her love of: 1
sat there with: 1
six inches shorter: 1
step 2 do: 1
that hogwarts was: 1
upside-down the boy: 1
how you investigate: 1
to them and: 1
do anything finally: 1
just because he: 1
in just a: 1
around and saw: 1
air while their: 1
along the lines: 1
what did you: 1
explain - without: 1
a few seconds: 1
smile hermione looked: 1
off i can't: 1
where i can: 1
a shy person: 1
been run over: 1
and then add: 1
but she was: 1
time in her: 1
what they'd been: 1
just as easily: 1
run with that: 1
shade of the: 1
quite enjoying it: 1
i can see: 1
in the ruins: 1
her head outside: 1
some triplets of: 1
feeling sort of: 1
test is harder: 1
own book and: 1
to her lips: 1
stained but -: 1
fanfics there one: 1
like to make: 1
the boy hesitated: 1
i don't know: 1
that the robes: 1
in which to: 1
of course you: 1
the domain of: 1
because all of: 1
could have come: 1
in books wait: 1
you know said: 1
hypothesis ' the: 1
you can make: 1
knocked excuse me: 1
rather smug sort: 1
muffled by the: 1
why did she: 1
you don't have: 1
just gone around: 1
europa attempt no: 1
just too awkward: 1
be shyer than: 1
cabin door hermione: 1
not that i: 1
it hermione's mind: 1
that thinking but: 1
you're the one: 1
made a prediction: 1
had seemed inclined: 1
hesitated what do: 1
churn out another: 1
wall with unnecessary: 1
timid knock at: 1
said and trailed: 1
asking how i: 1
2 'do an: 1
i'll have to: 1
something pc or: 1
it by the: 1
it honestly hadn't: 1
her bench harry: 1
the cloudless dawn: 1
you cast a: 1
a moment she: 1
read them only: 1
the boy's robes: 1
have just as: 1
well i was: 1
boy then we'll: 1
positive 1 yes: 1
and say what: 1
anything intelligent maybe: 1
saying that the: 1
from someone her: 1
for you but: 1
boy - no: 1
like they expected: 1
spun around and: 1
like you to: 1
a very good: 1
hands dirty and: 1
- and fred: 1
and the thought: 1
he-who-must-not-be-named though i: 1
apparently impossible which: 1
an air raid: 1
at that a: 1
connection the scar: 1
felt a stab: 1
itself and spat: 1
outside - just: 1
something terribly unfair: 1
turned to look: 1
and flipped the: 1
sad lonely gloomy: 1
the galaxy and: 1
off somewhere no: 1
i did warn: 1
more and flipped: 1
happened just now: 1
tip of the: 1
were you told: 1
to contribute to: 1
sort of see: 1
the other boy: 1
contains all of: 1
of something terribly: 1
- you stop: 1
her had insisted: 1
she did at: 1
items that would: 1
to suspect was: 1
goodness didn't you: 1
did something apparently: 1
only first-years that: 1
potter the kind: 1
as scared of: 1
he'd been expecting: 1
display himself to: 1
she had a: 1
these worlds are: 1
heard even as: 1
bright green cylinder: 1
that was just: 1
you're asking the: 1
your encyclopedic memory: 1
a month ago: 1
or get a: 1
her of something: 1
that probably doesn't: 1
us hopefully he: 1
could have happened: 1
the burnt remains: 1
planting a seed: 1
this the next: 1
out the window: 1
mean probably at: 1
potter it's going: 1
open - and: 1
a small shriek: 1
he'd only gotten: 1
lowered the soda: 1
her hand send: 1
to highest hermione's: 1
need the wand: 1
better of it: 1
of the other: 1
1981 the dark: 1
sat down on: 1
i don't want: 1
small trunk stood: 1
lot of cognitive: 1
now then may: 1
sat by the: 1
look since i: 1
poured a small: 1
baconian project finished: 1
raised his hand: 1
but i had: 1
of twisty negative: 1
read and she: 1
seemed like she'd: 1
that what i: 1
the robe was: 1
and those were: 1
a standard information: 1
but that was: 1
that way the: 1
boy annoying i: 1
say no it: 1
least i don't: 1
dark arts and: 1
hermione i want: 1
cabin but after: 1
the shade of: 1
wrong answers since: 1
and that it: 1
cupholder at the: 1
paused at least: 1
that's the best: 1
to disappear and: 1
that reminded her: 1
albus percival wulfric: 1
the future that's: 1
punch in the: 1
scar she rose: 1
she needed and: 1
a seer she: 1
things possible' and: 1
paper out and: 1
what's going on: 1
and found that: 1
which was ridiculous: 1
to do that's: 1
closed that cabin: 1
never actually tried: 1
hand and we: 1
she looked down: 1
add eight drams: 1
possible' and so: 1
proposition hermione said: 1
it but she: 1
blinked three times: 1
not impressed yet: 1
from this distance: 1
rather glad she: 1
the responsibility herself: 1
up and bowed: 1
do her mind: 1
didn't seem like: 1
the train with: 1
boldly taken the: 1
which would be: 1
all i needed: 1
didn't actually know: 1
what happened was: 1
them to have: 1
changed his lips: 1
in your pocket: 1
concentrate she was: 1
more sense is: 1
she still needed: 1
floor next to: 1
george and i: 1
to her why: 1
at her and: 1
parents gossiped for: 1
fans and if: 1
the realization hit: 1
heroic enough to: 1
the third time: 1
soda no thank: 1
first time in: 1
special than her: 1
take-charge sort of: 1
potter said how: 1
probably should have: 1
boy looked like: 1
of soda retrieving: 1
a cardboard display: 1
i test that: 1
feeling the rush: 1
sickle ' and: 1
she'd gotten a: 1
about the light: 1
expected now said: 1
his fingers again: 1
of it though: 1
a p-prefect but: 1
would be the: 1
former diameter and: 1
you're asking me: 1
hear the answer: 1
but it seems: 1
is performed only: 1
- no wait: 1
mention anything like: 1
say any spells: 1
hadn't occurred to: 1
speaking a bit: 1
green cylinder he: 1
hermione realized why: 1
needed she really: 1
robes then she: 1
of triplets that: 1
find it anywhere: 1
are charmed to: 1
many experiments and: 1
the prefects are: 1
much science do: 1
find a toad: 1
hermione i'm sorry: 1
can i offer: 1
bite anyone who: 1
my research there: 1
all things possible': 1
- then she: 1
of getting their: 1
don't know why: 1
the answer right: 1
whole point hermione's: 1
is one example: 1
times over to: 1
asked me as: 1
helpfulness kicked in: 1
much suddenly neville: 1
harry potter spat: 1
mine said the: 1
with that or: 1
of trying to: 1
let that stop: 1
at first but: 1
rather the wrong: 1
you're one of: 1
mind you're the: 1
window and stared: 1
gryffindor prefect come: 1
name is harry: 1
boy who would: 1
not vanish i: 1
utterly searing but: 1
of us all: 1
raise the entire: 1
some other answer: 1
books wait of: 1
can find a: 1
out in the: 1
door the boy: 1
and gold burst: 1
the wizarding and: 1
she'd read them: 1
in her mind: 1
drink hermione politely: 1
best way to: 1
to drink hermione: 1
nightmares honestly i: 1
clockwise and then: 1
trying to do: 1
her brand new: 1
'no' if they're: 1
in her whole: 1
face with bright: 1
three of me: 1
earlier that you: 1
look like the: 1
she was greeted: 1
vanish and fade: 1
the boy but: 1
so i can: 1
research of course: 1
and fade and: 1
and ran off: 1
light burning us: 1
surprise as though: 1
- i have: 1
triplet of three: 1
the boy in: 1
a rather odd: 1
drink he said: 1
not evil the: 1
scarfed face turned: 1
to that question: 1
when this experiment: 1
any case you're: 1
boy take the: 1
you investigate a: 1
the book with: 1
to finding out: 1
eek my clothes: 1
magical power well: 1
and the rise: 1
you another chance: 1
with pride i: 1
was looking for: 1
flipped the pages: 1
step back i: 1
i was hermione: 1
be an hpdm: 1
vanish i have: 1
- the boy's: 1
have to worry: 1
gave me candy: 1
to join my: 1
was me the: 1
least because this: 1
it to mine: 1
impress you the: 1
didn't you know: 1
could properly read: 1
boy his face: 1
or something pc: 1
she hadn't guessed: 1
be as scared: 1
books they won't: 1
scientists were supposed: 1
takes to be: 1
wait for harry: 1
voice when he: 1
think about i: 1
she was a: 1
less than 72: 1
a rule in: 1
you do then: 1
whole entire life: 1
long division then: 1
might actually be: 1
hermione granger if: 1
numbers' could have: 1
her mind back: 1
grownups get it: 1
where by 'no: 1
was already unwinding: 1
almost the same: 1
the first thing: 1
right about where: 1
i remember that: 1
with her mouth: 1
lot more sense: 1
always being this: 1
a hogwarts she: 1
jumbled that she: 1
practice and rational: 1
division then it: 1
disappear only if: 1
as he left: 1
decision theory and: 1
of the baconian: 1
had vanished and: 1
pages again if: 1
just sit down: 1
wait at his: 1
probably skip step: 1
gleamed with pride: 1
things stare into: 1
me first he: 1
was like she'd: 1
yet somehow if: 1
felt like shouting: 1
three numbers and: 1
not least because: 1
and put great: 1
her or even: 1
ah so you're: 1
bit rhetorically he: 1
or what she: 1
she'd somehow misheard: 1
means that whether: 1
were our grave: 1
- what are: 1
- the woman: 1
was the first: 1
mechanical pencil to: 1
was feeling sort: 1
hermione said in: 1
one had asked: 1
have a rule: 1
soda started its: 1
in a tiny: 1
confidence in their: 1
potter said at: 1
others 2-4-6 is: 1
i'm not wearing: 1
do i look: 1
i can fix: 1
said hermione go: 1
step 1 form: 1
had to read: 1
you-know-who's body chief: 1
her why did: 1
set into his: 1
a prediction that: 1
that fred and: 1
flinched back from: 1
spell and if: 1
starting to work: 1
by 'no time': 1
meant she wasn't: 1
all where this: 1
knocked on the: 1
it was but: 1
hermione the teacher: 1
unless she'd somehow: 1
negative thinking the: 1
eleven-year-old like her: 1
interfere with her: 1
boy hermione felt: 1
thing i did: 1
were the real: 1
anyone here know: 1
nope no banana: 1
was holding the: 1
the boy's mouth: 1
or maybe even: 1
solar system explore: 1
of immortality colonize: 1
then she remembered: 1
some bayesian probability: 1
t-told me that: 1
said at last: 1
slightly muffled by: 1
never he said: 1
worst nightmare come: 1
doesn't work we'll: 1
watched it started: 1
boogers the boy: 1
sharp snap and: 1
are investigating me: 1
what would make: 1
something now there's: 1
m-missing toads the: 1
now said the: 1
he was grinning: 1
door hermione said: 1
wizarding and muggle: 1
still didn't seem: 1
hermione objected then: 1
or obsessing about: 1
a trick yes: 1
potter there are: 1
you didn't get: 1
with a sharp: 1
hadn't realized she: 1
reason no one: 1
are j k: 1
looked inside the: 1
rather dryly miss: 1
further afield since: 1
the door the: 1
do that's awful: 1
realization hit her: 1
you want from: 1
31st 1981 the: 1
claim to fame: 1
instantly hermione wanted: 1
hermione although they: 1
vanished hermione let: 1
been expecting some: 1
teacher told me: 1
to work properly: 1
that's hardly the: 1
therapy by the: 1
potter hissed at: 1
be attacked by: 1
one of those: 1
and that was: 1
then said the: 1
a while to: 1
a quick question: 1
okay she hadn't: 1
that soda it's: 1
do you know: 1
on this train: 1
let out a: 1
check all the: 1
and an angry: 1
time she'd ever: 1
weren't to be: 1
books actually sounded: 1
it with a: 1
the crowd who: 1
the boy's expression: 1
ever help she: 1
of any possible: 1
than she'd ever: 1
with satisfaction and: 1
seemed to have: 1
the others invent: 1
a little punch: 1
came out like: 1
impressed yet hermione: 1
hermione said the: 1
hermione politely accepted: 1
green fluid onto: 1
how could you: 1
car on your: 1
gentlemen my name: 1
what scientists were: 1
and mechanical pencil: 1
thought better of: 1
xenophilius as always: 1
this time we'll: 1
a small bit: 1
the rush of: 1
which she'd automatically: 1
her lips again: 1
sky 8 degrees: 1
up to someone: 1
done to her: 1
parents' house near: 1
wide open -: 1
hermione said suspiciously: 1
a trembling young: 1
door come in: 1
boy - harry: 1
distance but she: 1
the sad thing: 1
brief moment harry: 1
looked out the: 1
a rule -: 1
as the saying: 1
boy spoke rather: 1
found that it: 1
can name the: 1
more good than: 1
probably first or: 1
was actually sort: 1
potter formerly lily: 1
harry potter closed: 1
to have you: 1
very widely now: 1
numbers in increasing: 1
swallowing and she: 1
would don't worry: 1
hand it was: 1
not realizing it: 1
clear that hermione: 1
called the 2-4-6: 1
someone needed help: 1
was the sort: 1
enough to be: 1
her third read-through: 1
of euphoria but: 1
effecting of all: 1
rhetorically he said: 1
muggle worlds raise: 1
you something to: 1
was ridiculous the: 1
was grinning very: 1
wanted to talk: 1
experiments and everything: 1
by the scarf: 1
voice of the: 1
herself hermione stared: 1
out by spilling: 1
another closed cabin: 1
way okay she: 1
she really wished: 1
it was him: 1
did everything the: 1
she wasn't sure: 1
more surreal i'm: 1
to those it: 1
which swallowed it: 1
her that he: 1
really get the: 1
more than she'd: 1
looking at the: 1
seemed inclined to: 1
at least six: 1
the air while: 1
scientist in your: 1
pause hermione nodded: 1
after him grew: 1
to suggest it: 1
her and her: 1
silver sickle ': 1
come with you: 1
rule and 'no': 1
bullying and mean: 1
some of that: 1
incredulously and that's: 1
robes getting stained: 1
as she'd ever: 1
magical history warns: 1
compartments yes whispered: 1
her own all: 1
seed in darkness: 1
anyone who doesn't: 1
suppose all the: 1
of got reasons: 1
at his side: 1
so you're asking: 1
some money ha: 1
what a strange: 1
agree that what: 1
or invite you: 1
do science properly: 1
trunk too hermione: 1
of disappointment she: 1
needed help -: 1
could actually benefit: 1
about you the: 1
there are lots: 1
of her had: 1
what other experiment: 1
silk wait until: 1
very much hermione: 1
gold red and: 1
he said just: 1
stained and i: 1
you for a: 1
that question i'm: 1
he was sure: 1
harry james potter-evans-verres: 1
hermione but those: 1
i should like: 1
charm for them: 1
her mind at: 1
not - but: 1
beauty and why: 1
in the sense: 1
betrayed by sirius: 1
gets a 'yes': 1
the surprising discovery: 1
a famous experiment: 1
actually rather glad: 1
why not attacked: 1
and stuck her: 1
you but it: 1
prefects are and: 1
surprising discovery the: 1
see if the: 1
home whose location: 1
in a voice: 1
consequences hermione opened: 1
if it vanished: 1
visible stir eight: 1
him firmly as: 1
eyes widened you're: 1
spider climbing what: 1
while he wrote: 1
it was me: 1
said something about: 1
interpreted this in: 1
was mean i: 1
she try to: 1
do you think: 1
so let me: 1
have an eidetic: 1
my hypothesis is: 1
fade and within: 1
his mouth again: 1
2-4-6 gets a: 1
see you touch: 1
but she'd never: 1
jaw dropped she: 1
good idea i: 1
when i was: 1
off and hermione's: 1
let it interfere: 1
empty bench across: 1
saying goes 'trust: 1
a few moments: 1
in his scar: 1
- no the: 1
with your research: 1
sound coming down: 1
strangled voice i: 1
weighing quality that: 1
colors green and: 1
all the robes: 1
that he might: 1
since she would: 1
to do was: 1
only question is: 1
cabin door left: 1
numbers are an: 1
able to figure: 1
come on neville: 1
closing hermione sat: 1
the tip of: 1
this case that: 1
was thinking or: 1
sort of sound: 1
but unfortunately she: 1
this in rather: 1
cognitive science and: 1
try to explain: 1
location was betrayed: 1
question i'm glad: 1
he withdrew his: 1
remains of you-know-who's: 1
more interesting and: 1
realized she would: 1
grease so hermione: 1
interfere at first: 1
harry potter's face: 1
eight drams of: 1
involved why didn't: 1
piece of paper: 1
grabbed neville's hand: 1
please have a: 1
lifted is that: 1
too inhibited for: 1
person who'd abandon: 1
century doesn't mention: 1
done all the: 1
display step 1: 1
find this boy: 1
the robe that's: 1
wasn't dealing with: 1
but even as: 1
for anything she'd: 1
- and he: 1
car and found: 1
and that only: 1
she'd boldly taken: 1
being tested the: 1
slithering sound coming: 1
of person who'd: 1
lot easier to: 1
her robes she: 1
door behind him: 1
seer that means: 1
away' so the: 1
come up with: 1
stir eight times: 1
and a step: 1
had a test: 1
at her -: 1
as she had: 1
project step 1: 1
three numbers are: 1
to imagine experiments: 1
how to answer: 1
rather than asking: 1
at the window: 1
the potion has: 1
she spun around: 1
survived the killing: 1
thought occurred to: 1
evening ladies and: 1
answer the shock: 1
asked whether if: 1
evans on july: 1
blank for a: 1
you to do: 1
more attention first: 1
things to think: 1
finished her drink: 1
i didn't mean: 1
he might actually: 1
in modern magical: 1
they're not i: 1
mpreg fic i: 1
with this spell: 1
he was about: 1
is going to: 1
villain who would: 1
that you cast: 1
itself so it: 1
get properly angry: 1
get the answer: 1
the hardest she'd: 1
hermione finished her: 1
had turned so: 1
have some knuts: 1
his forehead the: 1
said suspiciously girls: 1
i know everything: 1
though part of: 1
game of course: 1
3 was measuring: 1
send the door: 1
book which meant: 1
safely assume that: 1
thing is said: 1
july 31st 1980: 1
i intend to: 1
have somewhere to: 1
step 1 was: 1
whether an act: 1
then may i: 1
reminded her of: 1
three days ago: 1
if the chocolate: 1
pride i make: 1
that she didn't: 1
his eyes were: 1
so it occurred: 1
inter-train door opening: 1
her mind skipped: 1
this experiment is: 1
has nightmares honestly: 1
his face still: 1
and once clockwise: 1
a test what: 1
and began to: 1
the results but: 1
there wasn't some: 1
right and many: 1
so that she: 1
mind at the: 1
the silk wait: 1
said and then: 1
to her feet: 1
exactly i can: 1
key magical item: 1
'no' in fact: 1
door sliding shut: 1
was rather rereading: 1
you can name: 1
a seer that: 1
at the look: 1
a book and: 1
snuggled up next: 1
after we were: 1
potion has turned: 1
she could come: 1
in her life: 1
did warn you: 1
charm the boy: 1
kicked in full: 1
that the centaurs: 1
just a harry: 1
ladies and gentlemen: 1
both her and: 1
feel necessary -: 1
always this peculiar: 1
he needed our: 1
harry potter for: 1
but it's close: 1
a history no: 1
eyes tightly while: 1
of course i'm: 1
around harry potter: 1
harry potter had: 1
a thin line: 1
party or get: 1
meant always being: 1
real numbers in: 1
some soda on: 1
the way okay: 1
as bad as: 1
i haven't seen: 1
a take-charge sort: 1
rationality we'll have: 1
and you tested: 1
it trying to: 1
it's not that: 1
somehow misheard -: 1
and discovered my: 1
course i do: 1
your life always: 1
started to vanish: 1
charm truth beauty: 1
the question hermione: 1
right or wrong: 1
my intelligence so: 1
excuse me can: 1
but i won't: 1
'no time' i: 1
i mean probably: 1
at the product: 1
then she stared: 1
here you know: 1
then let's see: 1
it was hard: 1
was r-red and: 1
of books they: 1
seems likely that: 1
pouches more than: 1
and close the: 1
you're looking at: 1
frantically she tried: 1
keep themselves clean: 1
you i'm not: 1
gone around talking: 1
scarf from around: 1
fits some triplets: 1
nearly the same: 1
yes minus 3: 1
said since you: 1
i had to: 1
still a test: 1
themselves clean not: 1
same time and: 1
anyway and if: 1
although they didn't: 1
and after we: 1
no banana hermione: 1
twentieth century doesn't: 1
hermione let out: 1
down and continuing: 1
with something the: 1
the only question: 1
by now thank: 1
sense do you: 1
and grabbed neville's: 1
his trunk which: 1
hogwarts or something: 1
ago so the: 1
real test hermione: 1
a test and: 1
was hanging open: 1
grownup she had: 1
test or maybe: 1
we'll see if: 1
she saw the: 1
my fingers the: 1
just churn out: 1
or say any: 1
about the cardboard: 1
fame i have: 1
hiccuping in confusion: 1
feeling that this: 1
thought she was: 1
someone her own: 1
spells figure out: 1
evilly and so: 1
and decision theory: 1
into the domain: 1
more special than: 1
language in thought: 1
and george came: 1
all right hermione: 1
out hermione but: 1
- neville gave: 1
fact let me: 1
gave a small: 1
join my party: 1
warn you about: 1
an hpdm bottom: 1
gasped and flinched: 1
like the sort: 1
go ahead the: 1
this is a: 1
second year going: 1
you kept on: 1
his scar she: 1
has been less: 1
to show off: 1
anything i want: 1
forehead that reminded: 1
counterclockwise and once: 1
was looking really: 1
from you or: 1
don't believe you: 1
laid aside hogwarts: 1
hard to tell: 1
she had never: 1
not photographic i've: 1
magic into the: 1
proposition the boy: 1
that the stain: 1
secret of immortality: 1
hermione nodded allow: 1
very first time: 1
change - hermione's: 1
you get that: 1
for doing a: 1
isn't determined by: 1
will impress you: 1
small boy at: 1
was in the: 1
she said something: 1
a weak voice: 1
relief not least: 1
and judgment under: 1
before opening her: 1
well i should: 1
you have an: 1
can mop up: 1
what we were: 1
i haven't done: 1
like 'let's give: 1
empty in the: 1
tightly while he: 1
say about me: 1
taken to disappear: 1
think she heard: 1
mouth all she: 1
mean or anything: 1
and laughing evilly: 1
honestly i don't: 1
robes she had: 1
and my prediction: 1
a hypothesis that: 1
books believe me: 1
scarf over his: 1
actually the very: 1
was but i: 1
you did do: 1
would be a: 1
hypothesis step 3: 1
hypothesis step 2: 1
they saw what: 1
she didn't like: 1
to you please: 1
should have gone: 1
say what she'd: 1
somewhere to change: 1
at her in: 1
you just watch: 1
him grew to: 1
who isn't afraid: 1
politely accepted the: 1
a triplet of: 1
nature the rule: 1
that the fear: 1
game based on: 1
4 about the: 1
you help me: 1
technically all i: 1
i have a: 1
snake and made: 1
i warn you: 1
haven't seen you: 1
now smiling again: 1
under his scarf: 1
pouch at his: 1
by another timid: 1
the first day: 1
books so she'd: 1
abandon a little: 1
three real numbers: 1
her was not: 1
scurried in after: 1
their hypotheses instead: 1
is to pour: 1
everything i can: 1
bit of green: 1
said almost everything: 1
- hermione said: 1
nodded with satisfaction: 1
gets more attention: 1
the door she: 1
faint tinge of: 1
lords of chaos: 1
cold and grim: 1
of chaos you're: 1
widely under his: 1
talk to you: 1
out another publication: 1
not quite exactly: 1
whether to run: 1
teacher but it: 1
potter the harry: 1
not political power: 1
of all things: 1
stuck her head: 1
terrible and bullying: 1
than it looks: 1
girl and yet: 1
it slid back: 1
of a lightning: 1
a sigh of: 1
took a step: 1
a long pause: 1
rule and fold: 1
so you know: 1
could come up: 1
he closed the: 1
sort of person: 1
to decide whether: 1
chocolate frog stain: 1
on thinking of: 1
or anything like: 1
other thing -: 1
so the three: 1
then suddenly she: 1
knew it was: 1
been in her: 1
her mind but: 1
be that easy: 1
she'd never spilled: 1
who looked exactly: 1
seeing his worst: 1
world and godel: 1

an uncertain world: 1
theories about you: 1

because this meant: 1
if she'd just: 1
only slightly muffled: 1
her eyes tightly: 1
looking for a: 1
sort of the: 1

a live snake: 1
eaters or something: 1
that easy could: 1
a test she: 1

withdrew his hand: 1
and then her: 1
quite the surprising: 1
ancient temple or: 1
said as she: 1
sure about how: 1
said i'm not: 1
have to be: 1
hermione's brain kept: 1
boy had closed: 1
give candy to: 1
but that's hardly: 1
down the hallway: 1
a book when: 1
robes are charmed: 1
harry potter i'm: 1
i am nature: 1
no he said: 1
undead kings and: 1
proudly display himself: 1
the middle and: 1
like how people: 1

theory and a: 1
third time and: 1
actually be shyer: 1
the stomach it: 1
getting stained but: 1
them but i: 1
several minutes before: 1
ah hermione was: 1
with bright laughing: 1
your robes getting: 1
the robes come: 1
not to you: 1
before frantically she: 1
whole world and: 1
this is going: 1
harry potter there: 1

involves a scared: 1
hermione sat down: 1
called desensitization therapy: 1
is a game: 1
show off i: 1
that was one: 1
away for a: 1
potter - had: 1
always wished it: 1
minus 3 minus: 1
about me hermione: 1
you this time: 1
- had been: 1
around one-third full: 1
spilled on it: 1
like that no: 1
was a certain: 1
that's not a: 1
been done to: 1
just a few: 1
staring into the: 1
and continuing her: 1
then add eight: 1
now i went: 1
hermione was beginning: 1
hold on came: 1
rejected the null: 1
glad to hear: 1
the lords of: 1
that meant try: 1
the books say: 1
want happen just: 1
a step farther: 1
verify' no point: 1
mind flashed back: 1
added to my: 1
then it'll be: 1
mind finally made: 1
book when they: 1
boy said he: 1
off at least: 1
fold it up: 1
where the prefects: 1
to figure out: 1
remember that voice: 1
a hypothesis step: 1
know not political: 1
face i did: 1
or more harm: 1
who give you: 1
expression grew more: 1
your proposition the: 1
felt a little: 1
single 'no' so: 1
tell you 'yes': 1
bad as he: 1
cabin and his: 1
thinking or what: 1
other cars hermione: 1
to tell from: 1
of school hermione: 1
wulfric brian dumbledore: 1
'no' so 'any: 1
bright green fluid: 1
a slightly strangled: 1
here because all: 1
the green fluid: 1
faces darken and: 1
to do hermione: 1
own age you: 1
than harm or: 1
heck is really: 1
like a little: 1
all the testing: 1
it has been: 1
more intense this: 1
dirty rotten cheating: 1
maybe even the: 1
harry potter turned: 1
the woman next: 1
know why not: 1
boy thought she: 1
them and take: 1
drafts and potions: 1
pulled the door: 1
do please close: 1
in confusion every: 1
harry potter you're: 1
why she was: 1
the boy -: 1
sound of a: 1
the same amount: 1
more important things: 1
seem to be: 1
not sure that's: 1
the problem they'd: 1
real seer -: 1
her feet i: 1
your life surreal: 1
but she didn't: 1
out like they: 1
the thing itself: 1
when he was: 1
hardly the key: 1
a faint tinge: 1
the boy i: 1
memorize them all: 1
as she watched: 1
why not well: 1
few cabins that: 1
like we were: 1
seer - i'll: 1
toads the boy-who-lived's: 1
her incredulously and: 1
everything you needed: 1
he leaned forward: 1
a measuring weighing: 1
rule in fact: 1
i found out: 1
a high-pitched sound: 1
other criticisms until: 1
which fits some: 1
excuse me said: 1
really wished she: 1
insisted that harry: 1
were some people: 1
that still didn't: 1
this tiny little: 1
about this instead: 1
confused as she'd: 1
soda and poured: 1
holding the book: 1
and stared at: 1
we were done: 1
me you already: 1
that prefects weren't: 1
you're in modern: 1
the middle of: 1
this boy annoying: 1
you're harry potter: 1
book and even: 1
to make anything: 1
to pour it: 1
smugly she so: 1
my fingers it: 1
my claim to: 1
longbottom i'm looking: 1
school in one: 1
arts and great: 1
read the very: 1
looked neutral hermione: 1
do the research: 1
gotten a question: 1
a little boy: 1
saw this poor: 1
found alive with: 1
when they talked: 1
the negative side: 1
his head a: 1
my scarf so: 1
up to her: 1
while their parents: 1
determined by whether: 1

unreasonableness of the: 1
harry potter it's: 1
the harry potter: 1

at her intensely: 1
you don't mind: 1
a step back: 1
enjoying it with: 1
one of hermione's: 1

and then sat: 1
the scarves over: 1
neville longbottom neville: 1

but right now: 1
five times over: 1
another publication like: 1
even though some: 1
told me to: 1
automatically put into: 1
or anything else: 1
gave me that: 1
hermione pulled the: 1
all the dark: 1
my laws and: 1
the last car: 1
was a rather: 1
made the connection: 1
i was speaking: 1
this train -: 1

than that and: 1
inches shorter stay: 1
answer i mean: 1
only one who's: 1

do anything intelligent: 1
case anyone for: 1
he raised a: 1
the door and: 1
open were you: 1
just sat by: 1
it earlier it: 1
no time where: 1
for a moment: 1
was secondary to: 1
question is how: 1
interrupted what why: 1
scarf ah so: 1
soda in her: 1
original soda had: 1
know about hermione: 1
gasped and took: 1
an odd feeling: 1
as she popped: 1
allow me any: 1
nightmare come true: 1
on your forehead: 1
charmed to keep: 1
him technically all: 1
spat back the: 1
wrapped around his: 1
figure out the: 1
volume 1 anyway: 1
though some part: 1
would just walk: 1
never been able: 1
that way you: 1
it into the: 1
well she did: 1
so on but: 1
other answer well: 1
action and influence: 1
my toad no: 1

don't need the: 1
of a train-car: 1
of like how: 1
it vanish all: 1
was a shy: 1
i'll help you: 1
you're the only: 1
consequentialism by the: 1
hermione wanted one: 1
and influence science: 1
entertain any other: 1
tiny voice i'm: 1
they talked this: 1
hypotheses and put: 1
even let it: 1
scar set into: 1
young boy who: 1
a hand into: 1
read my school: 1
i can i've: 1
prefects weren't to: 1
eyes and tried: 1
a trick hermione: 1
little things like: 1
and rose dramatically: 1
she popped the: 1
i'm not impressed: 1
didn't find it: 1
next ingredient you: 1
font size in: 1
wearing my scarf: 1
me that prefects: 1
bothered over little: 1
have a silver: 1
but unless you: 1
the wrong question: 1
but she wasn't: 1
forehead in the: 1
too confused to: 1
since it involves: 1
terribly unfair having: 1
they expected now: 1
right said the: 1
were doing and: 1
happened was that: 1
his age when: 1
have found out: 1
silly for not: 1
brewing a potion: 1
of meeting people: 1
yet hermione said: 1
to know about: 1
quality that she'd: 1
by a trembling: 1
lord he-who-must-not-be-named though: 1
until the potion: 1
and trailed off: 1
increasing order lowest: 1
and coughed and: 1
her mouth wide: 1
any other criticisms: 1
with a sudden: 1
no the boy-who-lived: 1
a history and: 1
there with her: 1
known to me: 1
humanity centuries ahead: 1
in a slightly: 1
with her love: 1
anything she'd read: 1
probably did everything: 1
meant to talk: 1
and if he: 1
actually know but: 1
but not others: 1
odd slithering sound: 1
chaos you're the: 1
to be 2: 1
can the boy: 1
was about to: 1
want that do: 1
book to somewhere: 1
a tiny voice: 1
will turn out: 1
eyebrows lifted is: 1
if hanging around: 1
that would distinguish: 1
vanished and she: 1
say 'yes' but: 1
and take out: 1
hermione swung around: 1
never let that: 1
clean which would: 1
feet i i: 1
shouting it but: 1
properly wait that's: 1
over the universe: 1
soda onto a: 1
shyer than he: 1
do said hermione: 1
you looking for: 1
unless you can: 1
each time now: 1
diameter and snuggled: 1
her that the: 1
as she saw: 1
another eleven-year-old like: 1
you were found: 1
on a measuring: 1
about how to: 1
feel like she: 1
they won't quite: 1
4-6-8 said hermione: 1
by his height: 1
the boy walked: 1
professor mcgonagall and: 1
went to diagon: 1
charm already on: 1
- without giving: 1
based on a: 1
being interrupted by: 1
high-pitched sound that: 1
the bright green: 1
to find this: 1
some first-year's toad: 1
was one of: 1
like he knocked: 1
or tell me: 1
material was still: 1
the hallway of: 1
boy said paper: 1
to hogwarts no: 1
time and it: 1
those pouches more: 1
make a cardboard: 1
point in wondering: 1
head it's not: 1
head in the: 1
enjoyable and in: 1
or even let: 1
if you have: 1
take over the: 1
called consequentialism by: 1
to mine said: 1
me i intend: 1
sensible to her: 1
objected then she: 1
the universe hermione: 1
a young face: 1
encyclopedic memory added: 1
down at herself: 1
the way this: 1
world there was: 1
fresh in her: 1
of your parents': 1
bad or mean: 1
to do 2-5-8: 1
the chocolate frog: 1
any larger font: 1
frightened like he: 1
turn out in: 1
time she tried: 1
prefect who ought: 1
ask a quick: 1
a bit more: 1
way to show: 1
unfair having been: 1
suppose i could: 1
smiled rather smugly: 1
often worse than: 1
drams of unicorn: 1
so harry potter: 1
sure he was: 1
i i i: 1
silk after dropping: 1
fix it for: 1
on her face: 1
the next time: 1
in your mind: 1
down hard on: 1
and the boy: 1
potter had turned: 1
and not charmed: 1
sense is if: 1
right my hypothesis: 1
in the closed: 1
rule just so: 1
actually tried the: 1
this neville looked: 1
if the boy-who-lived: 1
prediction is that: 1
to reply to: 1
and even when: 1
i can mop: 1
her face i: 1
me on this: 1
tiny little whisper: 1
boy paused at: 1
made both her: 1
or not -: 1
underneath her robes: 1
could she try: 1
to her aside: 1
to be attacked: 1
31st 1980 on: 1
rule is one: 1
test she still: 1
a proposition hermione: 1
and rationality we'll: 1
your own asked: 1
faint rather reluctant: 1
and in any: 1
we might miss: 1
of me on: 1
you made a: 1
curse so you're: 1
fluid onto her: 1
with you but: 1
you a proposition: 1
who wanted to: 1
hermione couldn't think: 1
highest hermione's jaw: 1
before being interrupted: 1
the same size: 1
wrong this time: 1
soda retrieving a: 1
station - the: 1
in an uncertain: 1
last car of: 1
boy wasn't a: 1
the scarf excuse: 1
hermione hermione shook: 1
her pocket and: 1
with a charm: 1
you do anything: 1
hermione was still: 1
neville gasped and: 1
book he'd named: 1
are an instance: 1
their hands dirty: 1
by the same: 1
thinking of triplets: 1
can make anything: 1
don't think he: 1
she couldn't see: 1
went on for: 1
of the others: 1
whispered the boy: 1
very best sort: 1
that she had: 1
voice i hope: 1
another shot at: 1
or mean or: 1
mcgonagall and i: 1
hypothesis that meant: 1
over little things: 1
at the boy: 1
what harry potter: 1
and there didn't: 1
remember how to: 1
read about what: 1
had she missed: 1
somewhere in the: 1
the same mistake: 1
he wrote there: 1
an instance of: 1
coughed no he: 1
or staring into: 1
the thought occurred: 1
any wrong responses: 1
of hermione's primary: 1
no thank you: 1
she choked and: 1
i did when: 1
'no' so on: 1
help you my: 1
you no just: 1
science and practice: 1
she rather gingerly: 1
biases and language: 1
she said triumphantly: 1
at all where: 1
answer no i: 1
key issue now: 1
i'd have found: 1
pc or npc: 1
the door -: 1
is if he: 1
hermione started to: 1
and bowed to: 1
knuts boy have: 1
our help to: 1
a bright green: 1
the book told: 1
because of your: 1
rather a lot: 1
in thought and: 1
the candy i'd: 1
that if luna: 1
grew more intense: 1
of odd since: 1
spell to make: 1
again if you: 1
its former diameter: 1
well step 3: 1
numbers and i'll: 1
grim what were: 1
for harry potter: 1
i regret that: 1
you did wrong: 1
would make a: 1
and then footsteps: 1
of this is: 1
and give it: 1
face changed his: 1
so the material: 1
lectures or volume: 1
asked for help: 1
up and stuck: 1
that peculiar you're: 1
since i infer: 1
few seconds later: 1
and xenophilius as: 1
to her was: 1
that on the: 1
was enough to: 1
hard on her: 1
burning us hopefully: 1
frowned what had: 1
her in surprise: 1
when hermione pulled: 1
tell you said: 1
had been wearing: 1
young muffled voice: 1
last harry potter's: 1
was hermione granger: 1
it anywhere on: 1
to change hermione: 1
the train station: 1
only a faint: 1
to show my: 1
- but i: 1
invite you to: 1
of smile wordless: 1
face gleamed with: 1
you - which: 1
no wait at: 1
you are investigating: 1
ever been in: 1
boy started to: 1
is really going: 1
a single 'no': 1
project finished in: 1
your mind and: 1
read the feynman: 1
say you said: 1
work properly wait: 1
trouble so what: 1
buying science books: 1
boy's robes then: 1
you gave me: 1
she remembered what: 1
this was the: 1
good than harm: 1
siren in the: 1
earlier now the: 1
her - no: 1
who ought to: 1
the sheet of: 1
i'll let you: 1
could falsify them: 1
wrong and that: 1
out to her: 1
do an experiment: 1
and spat back: 1
going the burning: 1
quite intent now: 1
was just seeing: 1
have you found: 1
enough to make: 1
distinct feeling of: 1
like an air: 1
asked harry potter: 1
and his trunk: 1
hermione actually screamed: 1
potter i'm not: 1
never had a: 1
say it in: 1
you probably did: 1
up down strange: 1
some knuts boy: 1
the sense of: 1
told to wait: 1
it in fact: 1
was just another: 1
idea i didn't: 1
it out to: 1
realized the other: 1
it will turn: 1
time and quite: 1
she watched it: 1
was now smiling: 1
i ah hermione: 1
so jumbled that: 1
all these worlds: 1
next to them: 1
so i did: 1
a key magical: 1
his side and: 1
it three real: 1
the whole point: 1
don't bite anyone: 1
which is always: 1
unfold the sheet: 1
got reasons for: 1
step 3 was: 1
sounded like an: 1
don't want that: 1
the whole business: 1
what were his: 1
for a 'yes': 1
popped the top: 1
giving away the: 1
and the soda: 1
this in your: 1
age when he'd: 1
some paper towels: 1
some request along: 1
they didn't actually: 1
to hear them: 1
the game of: 1
magical drafts and: 1
bystander apathy held: 1
window she looked: 1
their wrong answers: 1
really didn't know: 1
the saying goes: 1
give it to: 1
she did think: 1
were born to: 1
time and i'll: 1
she was starting: 1
cabins that had: 1
a little further: 1
are you looking: 1
see what they'd: 1
intense this is: 1
another chance she: 1
near the burnt: 1
was the problem: 1
you please explain: 1
she have to: 1
us all screamed: 1
with their homework: 1
it's because i: 1
experiment to do: 1
surreal no one: 1
mind if i: 1
other girl would: 1
every time she: 1
hardest she'd ever: 1
hermione stammered what: 1
planet's standard of: 1
time now suppose: 1
of living move: 1
door behind you: 1
spells or magic: 1
of the world: 1
tell from this: 1
feared - hermione: 1
witch's robes on: 1
beginning to find: 1
the boy had: 1
spilling something on: 1
the boy's gaze: 1
granger it has: 1
were brewing a: 1
could if it: 1
live snake and: 1
just have to: 1
as though he'd: 1
are three of: 1
this confused oh: 1
in trouble so: 1
hogwarts was built: 1
the schoolbooks three: 1
to james potter: 1
didn't say i: 1
teach you how: 1
darken and blur: 1
wanted anything the: 1
two people involved: 1
you did was: 1
engines sputtered into: 1
boy was asking: 1
the research of: 1
case you're asking: 1
poured a bit: 1
any spells so: 1
or find out: 1
on it vanish: 1
forehead the shape: 1
dad always complains: 1
come in she: 1
annoyance in the: 1
to you or: 1
leave and close: 1
step 4 about: 1
one knows where: 1
the acromantula silk: 1
horizon and 8: 1
a brief pattering: 1
those were our: 1
containing the soda: 1
a history for: 1
now as though: 1
their parents gossiped: 1
book so that: 1
know said hermione: 1
- and saw: 1
think he needed: 1
you can read: 1
silly with a: 1
boy who looked: 1
and potions by: 1
for you hermione: 1
be worthy of: 1
she was thinking: 1
her life the: 1
soda had vanished: 1
on hermione said: 1
her mind a: 1
in darkness and: 1
car where the: 1
had been sitting: 1
triplets as possible: 1
a change -: 1
you needed to: 1
knows where the: 1
to my intelligence: 1
this distance but: 1
ingredient you added: 1
the boy started: 1
he spoke was: 1
thirsty by now: 1
problem they'd just: 1
the floor and: 1
potter spat that: 1
the instructions for: 1
neutral but suppose: 1
lonely gloomy depressed: 1
nightmares about this: 1
that out by: 1
to increase by: 1
they needed she: 1
a pouch at: 1
never seemed sensible: 1
actually sounded like: 1
formerly lily evans: 1
neutral hermione took: 1
stain disappeared rather: 1
my intelligence and: 1
found out that: 1
she really didn't: 1
also at this: 1
saw the boy: 1
i'd like you: 1
ingenuity tends to: 1
you but let: 1
closed cabin eek: 1
of sense do: 1
don't mind if: 1
by two each: 1
so on her: 1
it any more: 1
a child neville's: 1
ensuing quiz and: 1
wearing off and: 1
harm or more: 1
discovered my claim: 1
you can unfold: 1
she was just: 1
eating or staring: 1
null hypothesis that: 1
that whether an: 1
said quietly it: 1
where to find: 1
hadn't guessed right: 1
he might cry: 1
touch your wand: 1
have neglected the: 1
ahead the boy: 1
know it's a: 1
least six inches: 1
whose location was: 1
it that peculiar: 1
i can't really: 1
want to take: 1
peculiar she said: 1
all right said: 1
the look on: 1
was still a: 1
- hermione sat: 1
smile faded it: 1
get a key: 1
didn't try to: 1
have come from: 1
- unless she'd: 1
now the way: 1
do you made: 1
to cast back: 1
does anyone here: 1
don't look since: 1
opening and closing: 1
chance she was: 1
the part where: 1
but after the: 1
- known to: 1
for any reason: 1
fingers the boy: 1
you were making: 1
instance of the: 1
just watch he: 1
was that your: 1
screw by screw: 1
after a long: 1
his head in: 1
and biases and: 1
he went directly: 1
met someone from: 1
it involves a: 1
maybe this will: 1
the right answer: 1
of course with: 1
doing a science: 1
middle of swallowing: 1
intensely i've already: 1
work i have: 1
she felt as: 1
right the boy's: 1
i tell you: 1
a charm the: 1
i mean and: 1
as hermione was: 1
history for the: 1
in this tiny: 1
give you chocolate: 1
year going by: 1
odd since she: 1
and rational choice: 1
the rule in: 1
one example of: 1
she do she: 1
by screw the: 1
down strange charm: 1
i hermione's mind: 1
the real answer: 1
you're a first-year: 1
sitting down and: 1
their homework or: 1
we can all: 1
there said the: 1
trying to remember: 1
who gave me: 1
his head the: 1
npc that is: 1
i suppose i: 1
voice she wondered: 1
him even as: 1
girls weren't supposed: 1
boy-who-lived harry potter: 1
can do calculus: 1
long the original: 1
hermione the experiment: 1
with only a: 1
and i saw: 1
it's not the: 1
said the hand: 1
all right my: 1
sense of the: 1
and that the: 1
even as the: 1
books say about: 1
put great confidence: 1
ground against itself: 1
something to drink: 1
do was look: 1
the wand i: 1
shrouds - she: 1
in wondering when: 1
why do you: 1
candy what what: 1
stared at it: 1
don't panic said: 1
the results step: 1
think there were: 1
or harry potter: 1
back from him: 1
forward and looked: 1
properly angry is: 1
ran off shrieking: 1
you with your: 1
harm than good: 1
with the scar: 1
and why are: 1
the end -: 1
read upside-down the: 1
said in this: 1
n-no his badge: 1
famous experiment called: 1
prefects' car on: 1
you found that: 1
laughing green eyes: 1
'go away' so: 1
10-12-14 said hermione: 1
rule in your: 1
school hermione actually: 1
front car and: 1
kicking herself of: 1
only gotten the: 1
help then let's: 1
for is enjoyable: 1
attempt no fanfics: 1
to take a: 1
hermione's mind finally: 1
granger said that: 1
she'd read and: 1
her and say: 1
and muggle worlds: 1
and she supposed: 1
have napkins said: 1
those books so: 1
hand into a: 1
not well said: 1
that and modern: 1
on her bench: 1
believe you but: 1
here know the: 1
pattering of frantic: 1
said in the: 1
a charm already: 1
up and give: 1
spells so how: 1
experiment called the: 1
his trunk slithered: 1
hermione shook her: 1
open just in: 1
the last two: 1
a book which: 1
had the book: 1
did make a: 1
face still looked: 1
it doesn't have: 1
when he'd only: 1
books five times: 1
panic said the: 1
probably at least: 1
when he spoke: 1
works said the: 1
think the word: 1
screw the boy-who-lived: 1
an oddly disturbing: 1
question she didn't: 1
know that probably: 1
had to tell: 1
chocolate frog could: 1
people with their: 1
cast back for: 1
the time we're: 1
always a good: 1
watch he raised: 1
think of anything: 1
is called 'positive: 1
slightly strangled voice: 1
no one knows: 1
of girl and: 1
him some money: 1
of anything else: 1
wanted one of: 1
for not wanting: 1
test as many: 1
mean to scare: 1
is your life: 1
sheet which was: 1
immortality colonize the: 1
the boy apparently: 1
longbottom neville was: 1
the three numbers: 1
course with your: 1
she did now: 1
being charmed and: 1
you want -: 1
surreal do remember: 1
and - the: 1
finding some first-year's: 1
came just as: 1
could confirm their: 1
that sounded a: 1
a brief moment: 1
reveal neville longbottom: 1
course you gave: 1
voice only slightly: 1
train - neville: 1
means this is: 1
green and silver: 1
of spider climbing: 1
out that i: 1
from helping people: 1
robe was not: 1
disappointment she really: 1
seen you do: 1
and 'no' if: 1
to fame i: 1
but in this: 1
and i found: 1
of a lot: 1
she missed then: 1
granger a proposition: 1
i can just: 1
science do you: 1
to have nightmares: 1
look on her: 1
that harry potter: 1
no i haven't: 1
size in which: 1
tests go ahead: 1
paper towels in: 1
lots of crackpot: 1
them - that's: 1
there were some: 1
this peculiar she: 1
find it by: 1
what she'd read: 1
the window she: 1
that then the: 1
cry and hermione: 1
taller than that: 1
the soda vanished: 1
whatever it was: 1
fingers you'll -: 1
really frightened like: 1
something in the: 1
help - and: 1
lily potter formerly: 1
'any three numbers': 1
started to walk: 1

since they've done: 1
neville at least: 1
his lips set: 1
that was sort: 1

the further experimental: 1
just do the: 1
who told you: 1
trembling young boy: 1
reasons for not: 1

feeling a little: 1
three of us: 1
believe i see: 1
can i ask: 1
not just churn: 1
make her hand: 1
it seems likely: 1
minutes before the: 1
benefit from seeing: 1
do it at: 1
just discovered is: 1
bench harry potter: 1
and gentlemen my: 1
is harder than: 1
the shape of: 1
didn't mean to: 1
bought we were: 1
your parents' house: 1
how people imagine: 1
standard information sheet: 1
the floor a: 1
that - it's: 1
blatantly impossible that: 1
or something like: 1
some part of: 1
case someone needed: 1
2 very well: 1
- asked me: 1
you to change: 1
- that's not: 1
recruiting my fans: 1
the boy paused: 1
would have thought: 1
2 do an: 1
who was wearing: 1
the book so: 1
that only 20: 1
i'm meant to: 1
something the scarfed: 1
a little too: 1
on i think: 1
on i want: 1
intelligent maybe i'll: 1
directly to the: 1
of something to: 1
briskly i'll help: 1
inhibited for that: 1
quite exactly the: 1
raised a hand: 1
- it's not: 1
of another closed: 1
and bullying and: 1
scary that she: 1
the boy shut: 1
clothes don't panic: 1
this but then: 1
charmed but unless: 1
the key issue: 1
is the question: 1
getting their hands: 1
by spilling something: 1
that's not quite: 1
when he withdrew: 1
at the moving: 1
occurred to her: 1
you're looking for: 1
went blank for: 1
change hermione objected: 1
bite me first: 1
bit of soda: 1
time where by: 1
the whole world: 1
your own right: 1
and hermione realized: 1
everything came out: 1
fits the rule: 1
good way to: 1
an angry red-dark: 1
obsessing about her: 1
she supposed she: 1
to think of: 1
cabin nodded with: 1
brain hiccup that: 1
conduct experimental studies: 1
you tested it: 1
of frantic footsteps: 1
is right or: 1
and harry potter: 1
at least i: 1
make anything spilled: 1
boy turned and: 1
her and said: 1
easier to find: 1
to be worthy: 1
wand i can: 1
best sort of: 1
didn't adults ever: 1
the imputation that: 1
added after the: 1
giving him all: 1
meeting people had: 1
the pages again: 1
from inside the: 1
whatever odd reason: 1
was hard to: 1
on her hypothesis: 1
same mistake but: 1
but he t-told: 1
i need to: 1
i don't believe: 1
to run with: 1
up the soda: 1
of school in: 1
problem his eyes: 1
attacked your home: 1
degrees from the: 1
you said you: 1
lines of i: 1
she could properly: 1
then footsteps and: 1
testing she needed: 1
boy just because: 1
if the three: 1
after dropping in: 1
three times its: 1
the boy then: 1
now so jumbled: 1
car of the: 1
and 8 minutes: 1
get it right: 1
walk up to: 1
was asking for: 1
she'd just heard: 1
foot taller than: 1
feeling or why: 1
wrong isn't determined: 1
was still feeling: 1
information sheet which: 1
think you can: 1
one had been: 1
own which still: 1
i'm looking for: 1
body chief warlock: 1
good evening ladies: 1
and snuggled up: 1
for you just: 1
honestly hadn't occurred: 1
take another shot: 1
and she'd gotten: 1
prefect who isn't: 1
might miss the: 1
to pour some: 1
closed his mouth: 1
you off somewhere: 1
train station -: 1
that luna might: 1
to memorize them: 1
your answer no: 1
moments it was: 1
might be a: 1
at last harry: 1
soda all along: 1
strange thought goodness: 1
no fanfics there: 1
can fix it: 1
was him you: 1
becomes visible stir: 1
of things stare: 1
when she cast: 1
sound that could: 1
all right -: 1
2-4-6 task and: 1
if there wasn't: 1
potter snapped at: 1
just been run: 1
too hermione looked: 1
so hermione said: 1
head outside -: 1
last two days: 1
little boy just: 1
inside maybe gryffindor: 1
didn't say you: 1
door and then: 1
death eaters or: 1
odd feeling that: 1
and fred and: 1
the original problem: 1
time we're at: 1
instead of trying: 1
never spilled anything: 1
said paper and: 1
i have an: 1
to have neglected: 1
for the third: 1
that a frightening: 1
they might have: 1
need to go: 1
proposition miss granger: 1
first thing i: 1
for you to: 1
you already know: 1
wasn't quite sure: 1
a stab of: 1
away there was: 1
quite said the: 1
stop and guess: 1
years hermione was: 1
boy tilted the: 1
darkness when this: 1
voice on the: 1
dramatically i never: 1
and lily potter: 1
had closed that: 1
listen to those: 1
test like this: 1
offer you something: 1
my ingenuity tends: 1
by sirius black: 1
check the whole: 1
the door open: 1
an eidetic memory: 1
a sharp snap: 1
did when i: 1
began to smile: 1
for not realizing: 1
hermione granger said: 1
so she'd read: 1
is blatantly impossible: 1
that sounded like: 1
car have you: 1
i think there: 1
to do anything: 1
you say so: 1
crackpot theories about: 1
hermione granger sitting: 1
i look like: 1
shape of a: 1
took the soda: 1
halted on the: 1
hermione said briskly: 1
harry potter on: 1
her intensely i've: 1
boy do you: 1
potter and lily: 1
into the cupholder: 1
anything to you: 1
i can find: 1
said at almost: 1
over the ruins: 1
at it and: 1
it vanished eureka: 1
rub some of: 1
me as many: 1
on the empty: 1
shut the book: 1
right hermione frowned: 1
wearing a rather: 1
would proudly display: 1
a little sad: 1
do the experiment: 1
you or find: 1
looks bad or: 1
complains about so: 1
this doesn't work: 1
and counter-quiz went: 1
boy-who-lived you were: 1
worry i don't: 1
any more and: 1
and silver n-no: 1
who doesn't bite: 1
potter on the: 1
ffn does not: 1
boy's gaze took: 1
a little silly: 1
gingerly poured a: 1
have a seat: 1
claims that you: 1
sharpness - i: 1
potter's face gleamed: 1
in case anyone: 1
a lot easier: 1
everything the book: 1
in a wizard's: 1
own all right: 1
let's see how: 1
and yet it: 1
a spell and: 1
answer from inside: 1
probably doesn't mean: 1
back into his: 1
this were the: 1
can't seem to: 1
october 31st 1981: 1
get a single: 1
you added after: 1
it that's called: 1
scar on his: 1
to form a: 1
the connection the: 1
it said almost: 1
and most importantly: 1
said briskly i'll: 1
knocking at the: 1
had more important: 1
won't be as: 1
to test as: 1
small shriek and: 1
a lightning bolt: 1
put this in: 1
to meet people: 1
was what if: 1
green eyes and: 1
really going on: 1
me a triplet: 1
clean not quite: 1
appeared when hermione: 1
floor a few: 1
a harry potter: 1
though i suppose: 1
me any larger: 1
them to keep: 1
be a scientist: 1
work we'll find: 1
that hermione granger: 1
of course i: 1
was now so: 1
he'd be in: 1
boy waited his: 1
work my robes: 1
that's awful you're: 1
and hermione's mind: 1
potter was at: 1
poor boy what: 1
your research hermione: 1
hope you don't: 1
face turned to: 1
sorry i didn't: 1
she was sweating: 1
gone away for: 1
back for anything: 1
the boy his: 1
to we'll take: 1
on for several: 1
so what would: 1
the best way: 1
people she didn't: 1
possible reply to: 1
a sudden brain: 1
will disappear only: 1
on the robes: 1
request along the: 1
say - unless: 1
think i can: 1
her did sort: 1
step 2 'do: 1
this time and: 1
and made both: 1
folded piece of: 1
sort of smile: 1
worse than the: 1
hissed at that: 1
the train hermione: 1
least know why: 1
the boy's eyebrows: 1
wait until the: 1
door she did: 1
granger after the: 1
one alert reviewer: 1
the three of: 1
lowest to highest: 1
power well step: 1
gloomy depressed despairing: 1
prediction that would: 1
size even though: 1
sort of odd: 1
the other compartments: 1
test that -: 1
they've done so: 1
power and that: 1
yourself earlier now: 1
what she'd done: 1
floor and see: 1
lips again well: 1
sudden brain hiccup: 1
do then the: 1
later it vanished: 1
something wrong with: 1
she could probably: 1
after the acromantula: 1
were quite intent: 1
mind skipped gears: 1
that do it: 1
boy and so: 1
he said i'd: 1
have thought harry: 1
an act is: 1
mop up the: 1
neville i'll come: 1
off awkwardly so: 1
anything at herself: 1
hand in his: 1
investigate a confusing: 1
the experiment i: 1
see that page: 1
that your proposition: 1
experiment i want: 1
century it was: 1
loved being tested: 1
time we'll see: 1
with gratitude hold: 1
holding a tightly: 1
and do please: 1
was that fred: 1
about me professor: 1
she probably should: 1
let you help: 1
complicated hypotheses and: 1
named instantly hermione: 1
fingers again nope: 1
inside a book: 1
odd about the: 1
want you to: 1
a silver sickle: 1
said not unless: 1
fear is often: 1
twisty negative thinking: 1
odd feeling the: 1
muffled voice on: 1
do she had: 1
what the heck: 1
out and see: 1
know some bayesian: 1
the boy after: 1
monsters who give: 1
the door handle: 1
seeing that the: 1
like that and: 1
but not to: 1
said i'd like: 1
at least one: 1
homework or anything: 1
from earlier that: 1
the burning fire: 1
the cabin so: 1
about where this: 1
do 2-5-8 she: 1
aside hogwarts a: 1
sigh of relief: 1
looking for my: 1
say it exactly: 1
me the boy: 1
you know it's: 1
'the effecting of: 1
sad thing is: 1
where she thought: 1
of unicorn boogers: 1
hermione granger by: 1
to know a: 1
always interpreted this: 1
rather reluctant knocking: 1
why the boy: 1
with a scarf: 1
be a real: 1
it a lot: 1
keep them clean: 1
to walk toward: 1
apathy held them: 1
could probably skip: 1
sputtered into life: 1
despairing or obsessing: 1
she and harry: 1
general unreasonableness of: 1
a voice only: 1
of soda onto: 1
anything else they: 1
i don't bite: 1
was the hardest: 1
the only one: 1
i'm not sure: 1
into his forehead: 1
isn't afraid of: 1
work i'll start: 1
and she gasped: 1
go 4-6-8 said: 1
the one who: 1
glad she hadn't: 1
the 2-4-6 task: 1
me to be: 1
on here because: 1
and elbow grease: 1
the top was: 1
granger sitting alone: 1
all she could: 1
fashion please have: 1
in his and: 1
is said the: 1
no less the: 1
'let's give him: 1
anyone for any: 1
they were nearly: 1
the prefects' car: 1
at least until: 1
that you give: 1
from the horizon: 1
boy but there's: 1
least thirty-five years: 1
nowhere for you: 1
boy-who-lived gets more: 1
was wearing off: 1
said he leaned: 1
sure that's the: 1
that there are: 1
i'm sorry i: 1
gears ground against: 1
air raid siren: 1
- which was: 1
any possible reply: 1
a grownup she: 1
toad anyway and: 1
you very much: 1
cardboard display step: 1
finding out what: 1
first we'll find: 1
problems she was: 1
side of things: 1
sent you off: 1
to get properly: 1
from inside a: 1
him and laughing: 1
the voice said: 1
8 minutes before: 1
step 3 measure: 1
be quite clear: 1
your answer the: 1
that the soda: 1
at this neville: 1
mouth was hanging: 1
want to do: 1
heuristics and biases: 1
thought harry potter: 1
criticisms until that: 1
what what harry: 1
not allow me: 1
sounded like a: 1
diagon alley and: 1
it's a fixed: 1
a lad who: 1
having been done: 1
were found alive: 1
her eyes and: 1
boy's mouth was: 1
it doesn't work: 1
person she thought: 1
sitting alone on: 1
point hermione's brain: 1
suggest it hermione's: 1
mean anything to: 1
darkness and xenophilius: 1
did it do: 1
that's called desensitization: 1
the killing curse: 1
and then you: 1
hypotheses instead of: 1
built over the: 1
she was actually: 1
warlock albus percival: 1
on those books: 1
could it 1-3-5: 1
ever wanted anything: 1
afraid of getting: 1
hermione laid aside: 1
hours since i: 1
well well i: 1
but she thought: 1
have cast a: 1
you were brewing: 1
distinguish between the: 1
weak voice she: 1
searing but unfortunately: 1
to me but: 1
amount each time: 1
were undead kings: 1
she rose hastily: 1
what had she: 1
of science merge: 1
you were born: 1
granger it was: 1
moving scenery well: 1
robes on the: 1
the scarf over: 1
it exactly i: 1
grave shrouds -: 1
thought goodness didn't: 1
her drink and: 1
i have somewhere: 1
try to test: 1
the general unreasonableness: 1
something utterly searing: 1
and see what: 1
enough and what: 1
one is settled: 1
on july 31st: 1
window and said: 1
it works i: 1
in a thin: 1
item from you: 1
waited his face: 1
that page from: 1
was at this: 1
hear them but: 1
window and rose: 1
flinch i suppose: 1
trunk scurried in: 1
wrote there said: 1
right hermione said: 1
centuries ahead discover: 1
finally he said: 1
rise to her: 1
worlds raise the: 1
seen before from: 1
small bit of: 1
in the first: 1
game works said: 1
wished it was: 1
have gone with: 1
it with only: 1
a seed in: 1
tends to make: 1
the soda started: 1
most importantly figure: 1
she was rather: 1
that could confirm: 1
the boy who: 1
she'd just been: 1
memory added to: 1
misheard - does: 1
hermione said quietly: 1
with your encyclopedic: 1
i was looking: 1
charm on my: 1
as if she'd: 1
mean and not: 1
soda vanished hermione: 1
boy-who-lived's face changed: 1
boy shut the: 1
his hand it: 1
to check all: 1
said hermione the: 1
as the boy: 1
had been empty: 1
he knocked excuse: 1
the boy coughed: 1
his badge was: 1
no just a: 1
but verify' no: 1
swallowed it with: 1
frightening sort of: 1
fact she felt: 1
on your own: 1
done a bit: 1
just another eleven-year-old: 1
was a dirty: 1
were making oil: 1
being tested but: 1
nightmares involving horrible: 1
said i want: 1
alive with the: 1
shut jamming it: 1
face too much: 1
my robes and: 1
she wouldn't have: 1
cheating liar but: 1
may i help: 1
seem to find: 1
even when she'd: 1
mind went blank: 1
that i'm meant: 1
going on here: 1
that she'd never: 1
it's not photographic: 1
are lots of: 1
shock was wearing: 1
original problem his: 1
very useful sort: 1
wait here all: 1
was just too: 1
i think we: 1
hermione granger that: 1
you have what: 1
whether if luna: 1
behind you if: 1
settled i certainly: 1
her own book: 1
this is how: 1
had insisted that: 1
like the kind: 1
and unfolded it: 1
a fixed rule: 1
out and -: 1
green fluid was: 1
neville gave a: 1
of indignation that: 1
she thought she: 1
task and this: 1
many of the: 1
hermione tried to: 1
all along the: 1
of relief not: 1
all safely assume: 1
and not just: 1
again and began: 1
granger if you're: 1
it vanished but: 1
smile wordless wandless: 1
wished some other: 1
head the imputation: 1
hogwarts he'd be: 1
as easily been: 1
make it a: 1
lot of hard: 1
be interrupted what: 1
sort of like: 1
in any case: 1
colonize the solar: 1
my pet toad: 1
your hypothesis ': 1
uncertain world and: 1
he knocked on: 1
said voice full: 1
kept on thinking: 1
than her own: 1
domain of science: 1
you my name: 1
boy and he: 1
helping people with: 1
quarks or where: 1
wanted to interfere: 1
thing - well: 1
dirty and if: 1
discovery the boy: 1
make it to: 1
own asked harry: 1
know the boy: 1
himself to the: 1
of something that: 1
this poor small: 1
the boy turned: 1
than he appeared: 1
supposed she could: 1
still needed to: 1
was sure he: 1
saw what we: 1
over our faces: 1
badge was r-red: 1
why didn't adults: 1
think they were: 1
trunk - and: 1
awkwardly so harry: 1
she had an: 1
might faint with: 1
be 2 very: 1
door left open: 1
be tested on: 1
still there but: 1
will be stained: 1
that you survived: 1
sliding shut jamming: 1
so you're called: 1
just a month: 1
about her problems: 1
rule and then: 1
of villain who: 1
thing itself so: 1
responsibility herself when: 1
'do an experiment: 1
skip step 4: 1
my help then: 1
ago then she: 1
finished in no: 1
that voice you're: 1
harry potter i've: 1
it's going to: 1

hermione sat there: 1
weak tentative faint: 1
in this case: 1

pencil to his: 1
he feared -: 1
name the six: 1
but - hermione: 1
a very useful: 1
were supposed to: 1
and that's not: 1
dryly miss hermione: 1
at herself the: 1
the way the: 1
doesn't mention anything: 1
tried to get: 1
snapped at her: 1
couldn't see it: 1
my party or: 1
awful you're awful: 1
crying now i: 1
you asked me: 1
could leave and: 1
toad no hermione: 1

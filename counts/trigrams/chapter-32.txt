turn the whole: 1
just bitten into: 1
permit you to: 1
most useful friends: 1

newton actually was: 1
and safe so: 1
played cheerful bells: 1
childish pique counted: 1
opportunities professor quirrell: 1
argued some of: 1
it was clear: 1
your generosity with: 1
harry argued some: 1
will cost you: 1
in boredom while: 1

it went all: 1
- i can't: 1
severely as your: 1
gold and silver: 1
children barely past: 1
fourteen galleons and: 1

on harry said: 1
than making it: 1
well the easiest: 1
silence and isolation: 1
throw away a: 1
changed to lower: 1
quirrell did not: 1
it seemed wrong: 1
duly noted probably: 1
historical figures i: 1
i do apologize: 1
his voice practically: 1
said at once: 1
his eyes well: 1
special for fred: 1
wonderland and let: 1
cheer a note: 1
grim revulsion like: 1
for magical day: 1
quirrell that it: 1
had checked and: 1
every charm they: 1

chuckled briefly seriously: 1
i do hope: 1

to boot it: 1
and it was: 1
show up before: 1
on multiple weasleys: 1

smiled slightly of: 1
young children barely: 1
would be allowed: 1
government-in-exile who is: 1
and more ominous: 1
the story harry: 1
impression that everyone: 1
cycle didn't start: 1
bright as the: 1
just had to: 1
dripping with distaste: 1
their own way: 1
but allowing you: 1
got no idea: 1

with deep gratitude: 1
but i've got: 1
draco malfoy said: 1

from a certain: 1
possible that someone: 1
precious paces of: 1
toys that played: 1
that everyone in: 1
quirrell with a: 1
a friend is: 1
out at harry: 1

he was regretting: 1
with witches and: 1
thin line i: 1
a festive holiday: 1

as much a: 1
heart's content it: 1
lose rather than: 1
and he was: 1
place to store: 1
a certain government-in-exile: 1
then hire an: 1
of the shoppers: 1
witches and wizards: 1
carefully said professor: 1
a cheerful holiday: 1
would be reminded: 1
into food that: 1
into a cheerful: 1
quirrell would have: 1
his hands together: 1
more than any: 1
the task of: 1

all of my: 1
some deeper motive: 1
dealing with anyway: 1
not admit it: 1
made from kittens: 1

to rotate but: 1
yet ready to: 1
do you need: 1
to right and: 1
professor professor quirrell: 1
to keep the: 1
a part of: 1
and seed funding: 1
pitch these things: 1
to me you: 1
notes harry did: 1
had increased by: 1
simply did not: 1
been made from: 1
harry was afraid: 1
potter though only: 1
play the game: 1
resort to anything: 1
of blackest night: 1
harry had gotten: 1
speechless i will: 1
december 25th unlike: 1
almost as severely: 1
and bustle of: 1
well sort of: 1
and the two: 1
generosity with every: 1
fear the consequences: 1
of action harry's: 1
shops enshrouded in: 1
knew look said: 1
but headmaster harry: 1
parents took them: 1
be slytherin here: 1
was literally speechless: 1
out of his: 1
look like he: 1
hands together in: 1
mr potter how: 1
gameboard the bright: 1
it was also: 1
grave sad look: 1
only barely then: 1
revulsion like he'd: 1
so eager to: 1
dislike and then: 1
right way they: 1
something special for: 1
with every charm: 1
they would be: 1
said his lips: 1
as bright as: 1
be if i: 1
fast and certain: 1
those five galleons: 1
over your own: 1
help me be: 1
harry professor quirrell: 1
checked and he: 1
to their heart's: 1
bath-robes and young: 1
their tiny sphere: 1
you turned your: 1
year that's brilliant: 1
someone from a: 1
he smiled slightly: 1
note of blackest: 1
explicit threat out: 1
five five galleons: 1
away in boredom: 1
the headmaster think: 1
as your adult: 1
you need any: 1
redoubled as christmas: 1
probably i'd have: 1
there were witches: 1
suspicious after the: 1
start to rotate: 1
control over your: 1
worth of knuts: 1
the easiest way: 1
you didn't suggest: 1
curiosity mr potter: 1
mr potter though: 1
away a friend: 1
it was rotten: 1
threat i think: 1
peered out at: 1
disruptive just for: 1
a fit of: 1
professor quirrell had: 1
whole area into: 1
better yet to: 1
with lights that: 1
good investment opportunities: 1
said harry at: 1
age who were: 1
of harry's mouth: 1
eyes well said: 1
since you counted: 1
this expedition i: 1
dumbledore and i: 1
doing transfiguration experiments: 1
you were wise: 1
was morally repugnant: 1
a real bank: 1
some other historical: 1
harry's mouth snapped: 1
discovers i've been: 1
them walked on: 1
voice trailed off: 1
i plan to: 1
just don't do: 1
a discount on: 1
of silence and: 1
reminded of your: 1
compliment i suppose: 1
old wizard -: 1
at least you: 1
boy your age: 1
before the start: 1
make after biting: 1
slytherin here and: 1
professor quirrell that: 1
to play the: 1
the gift of: 1
george and i've: 1
quirrell had turned: 1
does the headmaster: 1
any boy your: 1
sort of grim: 1
methods that were: 1
that someone kept: 1
experiments without consulting: 1

but then it: 1
safe so he'd: 1
name this failed: 1
say anything just: 1
harry's voice trailed: 1

tasted horrible but: 1
getting them a: 1
of christmas as: 1
with anyway i: 1
might've gotten suspicious: 1
though only barely: 1
right and where: 1
tell mr ollivander: 1
if i hadn't: 1
upset the gameboard: 1
much independence of: 1
bewildering variety of: 1
with your vault: 1
galleons with which: 1
after biting into: 1
all that crush: 1

wrong somehow maybe: 1
little to himself: 1
you are not: 1

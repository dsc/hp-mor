what mcgonagall said: 2
some of this: 2

gold coins with: 2
a few toys: 2
mr potter you: 2
if i can: 1
and just pull: 1
harry with a: 1
maybe and gold: 1
can hold a: 1
fingers tapped against: 1
some sort of: 1
seventeen anyway and: 1
what no not: 1
later and get: 1
intent i would: 1
twenty gold galleons: 1
griphook sighed and: 1
that when i'm: 1
would not be: 1
want one and: 1
no not like: 1
vault mcgonagall watched: 1
a great jingling: 1
favoring harry with: 1
a twentieth part: 1
no said harry: 1
instead of later: 1
is watching you: 1
by defeating the: 1
too it's like: 1
undetectable extension charm: 1
bounties might not: 1
mentioned earlier i: 1
meanwhile the giant: 1
of the bargain: 1
it became impossible: 1
for a wand: 1
times less interesting: 1
head your father: 1
so forty thousand: 1
pouch with a: 1
it for more: 1
gold coins was: 1
engaging in a: 1
slowly so some: 1
and they left: 1
in and take: 1
- and maybe: 1
from bounties that: 1
me sort of: 1
either dimension of: 1
a consistent value: 1
toys compared to: 1
guess i won't: 1
filed away this: 1
muggle world exchange: 1
certain fee where: 1
revision world domination: 1
all possible causes: 1
exchange rate bring: 1
harry pleaded i'm: 1
the entire world: 1
where she waits: 1
mcgonagall a philosopher's: 1
the base and: 1
a usual amount: 1
that size so: 1
right away wouldn't: 1
out of your: 1
around five heaps: 1
her eyes intent: 1
to his ki-: 1
galleons stacks of: 1
probably better on: 1
a silent staring: 1
a week harry: 1
and it looked: 1
mr griphook so: 1
wizarding britain mr: 1
better one later: 1
vault whenever you: 1
family vault he: 1
what i think: 1
here which would: 1
you are a: 1
why rain on: 1
go in and: 1
can remember seeing: 1
the whole weight: 1
fiscal prudence and: 1
as others have: 1
professor mcgonagall but: 1
at any rate: 1
parade surely this: 1
be worth about: 1
in their twenties: 1
fifty to one: 1
when i'm an: 1
could i get: 1
service to wizarding: 1
k rowling is: 1
of later and: 1
in front of: 1
time why act: 1
them would make: 1
the goblin his: 1
were intent i: 1
would trust any: 1
fifty british pounds: 1
was pyramidal so: 1
should have drained: 1
the word to: 1
of their financial: 1
same money either: 1
of being ungrateful: 1
hands upon a: 1
retrieval charm and: 1
five heaps of: 1
look of delight: 1
decent math and: 1
on you-know-who payable: 1
potter-evans-verres no said: 1
a very tiny: 1
definitely need one: 1
charge in fees: 1
hopefully mcgonagall's gaze: 1
of character so: 1
of snide remark: 1
mr potter-evans-verres the: 1
and a little: 1
million british pounds: 1
discover all things: 1
i buy a: 1
know that i: 1
in the middle: 1
domination is such: 1
have to waste: 1
it would make: 1
gold-to-silver ratio got: 1
pants-leg that makes: 1
not be expecting: 1
ten thousand british: 1
ever ran out: 1
week harry filed: 1
exchange it for: 1
top three books: 1
arbitraging away market: 1
completely decoupled from: 1
wand and children: 1
whenever you wanted: 1
possible mcgonagall hesitated: 1
keep some of: 1
what would you: 1
than their outsides: 1
suppose i came: 1
mr potter yes: 1
there were around: 1
pardon me for: 1
by dragons where: 1
metal making them: 1
starbucks would be: 1
saying hogwarts can: 1
wasn't the muggle: 1
a way of: 1
harry smiled with: 1
vault and left: 1
less guilty about: 1
may be from: 1
intent well that: 1
want to have: 1
ten galleons griphook: 1
came out wrong: 1
when he had: 1
on me at: 1
am totally on: 1
made from it: 1
it's also possible: 1
economics you can't: 1
square with seven: 1
idea at all: 1
to reviewer elldenstorm: 1
that i could: 1
your father was: 1
between worlds the: 1
the part of: 1
and couldn't take: 1
a decent math: 1
tapped against his: 1
pounds even starbucks: 1
door are you: 1
potter it's also: 1
the pure metal: 1
world exchange it: 1
very expensive mr: 1
which would constitute: 1
you could just: 1
to have to: 1
muggle gold to: 1
seem inconsistent in: 1
whoever might defeat: 1
have to just: 1
j k rowling: 1
does a 'mokeskin: 1
to be worth: 1
eyes for a: 1
like the super: 1
carry a whole: 1
questions he didn't: 1
he'd been tempted: 1
i won't hold: 1
blankly griphook grinned: 1
of money pardon: 1
griphook and can: 1
whole body seemed: 1
to make reasonable: 1
old textbooks so: 1
tradition yes exactly: 1
trust any but: 1
rough numbers very: 1
tempted to make: 1
i think that: 1
about sixty coins: 1
taut seemed to: 1
and that i: 1
silver should have: 1
griphook stared at: 1
wouldn't have to: 1
an insignificant fraction: 1
eyes intent well: 1
sort of possibly: 1
items until they: 1
awesomeness batman's utility: 1
been placed on: 1
discovering the amazing: 1
call it world: 1
board with fiscal: 1
of those too: 1
not only is: 1
you should have: 1
the metal making: 1
it can't do: 1
also possible mcgonagall: 1
are very expensive: 1
with me at: 1
using an insignificant: 1
books i was: 1
like the silver: 1
money or had: 1
really is in: 1
grim satisfaction it: 1
think that any: 1
by the one: 1
into the other: 1
your head twenty: 1
seeing one or: 1
used bookstores for: 1
alarmed it's a: 1
it mr potter: 1
few toys using: 1
either way i: 1
was standing in: 1
looked to be: 1
will only be: 1
gold coins within: 1
the door of: 1
requirements harry stumped: 1
mr potter it's: 1
withdrawals from -: 1
to the galleon: 1
giant heaps of: 1
that i'm saying: 1
for a fee: 1
stored your money: 1
up all the: 1
other hand one: 1
locked you in: 1
i ever mow: 1
started with and: 1
and maybe a: 1
when instead you: 1
to bribe people: 1
not bad harry: 1
for a young: 1
you think you: 1
a mini sf: 1
doing a fermi: 1
dragons where you: 1
the sickles for: 1
two other things: 1
like that mr: 1
could just carry: 1
waits eternally in: 1
mind elsewhere hold: 1
swallowed the word: 1
the occasion harry's: 1
young face as: 1
perhaps the entire: 1
an additional hundred: 1
i'm asking if: 1
one harry didn't: 1
anyway and it: 1
of your vault: 1
so fearsome and: 1
wizarding for the: 1
earned by defeating: 1
very much wish: 1
are going to: 1
i am going: 1
to regret this: 1
mcgonagall you should: 1
days frantically hitting: 1
open at the: 1
best of all: 1
can't eat money: 1
ought to suit: 1
a retrieval charm: 1
rate bring in: 1
do what i: 1
weight griphook's eyes: 1
became impossible to: 1
seven galleons for: 1
- mr potter: 1
getting rough numbers: 1
general are made: 1
coins high and: 1
whole tool set: 1
cheap and i: 1
with glittering eyes: 1
i'm picking a: 1
who was waiting: 1
as much sense: 1
yes exactly mcgonagall's: 1
like you mentioned: 1
of magic and: 1
money may be: 1
amount of money: 1
to spend the: 1
wrong sir i: 1
am all about: 1
size so forty: 1
sickles and pay: 1
for the coining: 1
the goblin watched: 1
power of a: 1
thousand galleons or: 1
as i buy: 1
whole pile of: 1
have them around: 1
potter yes but: 1
said puzzled perhaps: 1
coins with a: 1
i am totally: 1
near the door: 1
been collected yet: 1
the look of: 1
her head your: 1
i can afford: 1
can have a: 1
watching the look: 1
more than their: 1
certain grim satisfaction: 1
magic and couldn't: 1
that he was: 1
gold was what: 1
possibly even outright: 1
contest like what: 1
of economics you: 1
said finally what: 1
fermi estimate said: 1
a whole pile: 1
been tempted to: 1
keep in a: 1
he had so: 1
possibly even if: 1
a fraction of: 1
textbooks so i: 1
books right that's: 1
pound harry wheeled: 1
metal would well: 1
a suggested revision: 1
don't push it: 1
your words though: 1
a giant heap: 1
a gaze of: 1
british pounds a: 1
now instead of: 1
glittering eyes for: 1
to buy it: 1
usual amount of: 1
coins guarded by: 1
had to go: 1
that's a -: 1
these coins the: 1
watching you from: 1
know rowling said: 1
it now instead: 1
others have noted: 1
said was roughly: 1
coffee here cost: 1
supplies mr potter: 1
the wall but: 1
using hand-me-down wands: 1
holding never mind: 1
to lean casually: 1
i wonder surely: 1
are a minor: 1
emplaced them yes: 1
take out coins: 1
deny the logic: 1
tool set in: 1
at all how: 1
until they are: 1
withdraw an additional: 1
words harry said: 1
would be worth: 1
eyes were intent: 1
a wild guess: 1
harry said finally: 1
away from the: 1
allowed to make: 1
start from just: 1
the larger muggle: 1
fundie could probably: 1
sir i just: 1
the library i'm: 1
literally stored your: 1
this is a: 1
that had been: 1
inefficiencies might well: 1
other when he: 1
of the whole: 1
of all possible: 1
where to start: 1
of this money: 1
i think it: 1
just outside the: 1
british pounds to: 1
one who emplaced: 1
out coins out: 1
rate so how: 1
metal harry said: 1
feel less guilty: 1
his mind elsewhere: 1
i bring if: 1
one lousy pound: 1
would want a: 1
free meanwhile the: 1
in general are: 1
one here has: 1
again harry was: 1
so some of: 1
am doing it: 1
with a ton: 1
books i bring: 1
making them up: 1
pay 5 change: 1
but - harry: 1
in a ton: 1
being rich which: 1
per heap roughly: 1
but i did: 1
i would be: 1
- i am: 1
world within a: 1
implied five british: 1
my parents were: 1
to waste another: 1
a young couple: 1
weight of seventeen: 1
sweeter for you: 1
shook her head: 1
afford them now: 1
take time out: 1
somewhere or other: 1
just want to: 1
on i'm doing: 1
and i am: 1
galleon either gold: 1
ratio somewhere around: 1
that implied five: 1
coins looked to: 1
heap of gold: 1
face i would: 1
twentieth part of: 1
hand-me-down wands thanks: 1
about reasonable i: 1
five thousand pounds: 1
somewhat alarmed it's: 1
well be lost: 1
will be more: 1
logic of your: 1
which had been: 1
think that will: 1
noise and sprawling: 1
harry locked gazes: 1
as such you: 1
them up griphook: 1
all sorry if: 1
not have been: 1
heaps of that: 1
money pardon me: 1
griphook hissed mcgonagall: 1
them into the: 1
later harry trailed: 1
i can remember: 1
ratio got more: 1
with a great: 1
is in a: 1
have to consult: 1
it anyway that's: 1
parents were in: 1
of money griphook: 1
it would be: 1
you of being: 1
until it became: 1
thereby collects seigniorage: 1
waiting near the: 1
a tenth of: 1
that came out: 1
decoupled from the: 1
silver could i: 1
and put a: 1
here with a: 1
a little spending: 1
such things existed: 1
him or those: 1
a better one: 1
of bronze knuts: 1
yet i'll make: 1
might well be: 1
constitute sensible grown-up: 1
sense to buy: 1
tenth of a: 1
sprawling backward into: 1
them around somewhere: 1
just pull one: 1
purchases harry locked: 1
outright admiration and: 1
dumping them into: 1
eight thousand galleons: 1
hissed the goblin: 1
remember the occasion: 1
money the finer: 1
outside the door: 1
i get a: 1
say professor mcgonagall: 1
sensible grown-up purchases: 1
potter vault ought: 1
money griphook sighed: 1
dimension of the: 1
either gold or: 1
in a trunk: 1
or other it's: 1
growled there was: 1
fear i cannot: 1
calculation a what: 1
me what no: 1
all times and: 1
test of character: 1
looked bemused i: 1
have drained from: 1
accusing you of: 1
in the best: 1
the spirit and: 1
repeat wasn't the: 1
this notion in: 1
what are a: 1
apparent purchasing power: 1
times and just: 1
mcgonagall said finally: 1
him with glittering: 1
around somewhere or: 1
the family vault: 1
one with lots: 1
numbers very quickly: 1
said the coins: 1
backward into a: 1
galleon as others: 1
muggle gold-to-silver ratio: 1
doing a great: 1
thank you very: 1
it it's the: 1
with a certain: 1
smile and remember: 1
much mr griphook: 1
face as i: 1
staring contest like: 1
2 million british: 1
and sticking with: 1
her face so: 1
right that's a: 1
the other hand: 1
only be allowed: 1
wizard britain has: 1
coins within the: 1
goblin coin in: 1
said finally trunks: 1
you wanted to: 1
when they died: 1
where would you: 1
with one hand: 1
i prefer to: 1
perhaps not then: 1
aren't supposed to: 1
expecting to lay: 1
it was too: 1
face grew stern: 1
wide in either: 1
anyone coin them: 1
stumped forward and: 1
of coffee here: 1
the coining harry: 1
with seven galleons: 1
other words harry: 1
me buy -: 1
to be getting: 1
lots of room: 1
came in here: 1
range of gold: 1
your money in: 1
to be about: 1
a little sweeter: 1
anyway that's the: 1
heaps stacks of: 1
guarded by dragons: 1
galleons per heap: 1
change the sickles: 1
on my parade: 1
i could i: 1
would well pay: 1
don't panic professor: 1
and pay 5: 1
you find a: 1
don't remember the: 1
i'm going to: 1
pounds not bad: 1
trunks whose insides: 1
mcgonagall mr potter: 1
doesn't square with: 1
a sense mine: 1
was right in: 1
eat money mcgonagall: 1
coins with one: 1
even outright admiration: 1
noted i'm picking: 1
got more than: 1
hissed mcgonagall a: 1
called forth by: 1
cannot deny the: 1
here and they: 1
you say professor: 1
he had reached: 1
said for now: 1
lay your hands: 1
disclaimer j k: 1
be allowed to: 1
you mcgonagall growled: 1
a swiss army: 1
right in the: 1
you charge in: 1
spirit and does: 1
of frank respect: 1
asking if galleons: 1
for galleons take: 1
you questioning the: 1
so not only: 1
harry stood there: 1
system but the: 1
could probably own: 1
from it for: 1
a fermi calculation: 1
whole wizarding world: 1
pure gold of: 1
to whoever might: 1
made sense being: 1
i think i: 1
phrase i prefer: 1
respect possibly even: 1
pouch' do what: 1
a certain fee: 1
a minor and: 1
my superiors give: 1
as much as: 1
mcgonagall why rain: 1
and does a: 1
the used bookstores: 1
not sure interesting: 1
i very much: 1
coins were actually: 1
it's like the: 1
change to sickles: 1
you could smile: 1
into a heap: 1
out anywhere i'll: 1
it for a: 1
full of gold: 1
would make good: 1
i'm doing a: 1
front of a: 1
a quick fermi: 1
gaze didn't waver: 1
then again harry: 1
an adult i'll: 1
to store in: 1
rule one of: 1
old family mr: 1
sixty coins high: 1
two days frantically: 1
twenties when they: 1
his face i: 1
coins the pure: 1
be from bounties: 1
what do you: 1
issued by a: 1
world domination is: 1
larger muggle economy: 1
rowling said something: 1
understand that my: 1
make reasonable withdrawals: 1
some of the: 1
the gold coins: 1
worth about fifty: 1
forth by the: 1
spending money like: 1
innocent childhood watching: 1
their financial system: 1
mcgonagall said sounding: 1
was archetypal are: 1
school supplies mr: 1
harry wheeled from: 1
was too bad: 1
fool would trust: 1
of a galleon: 1
muggle economy no: 1
silver i wonder: 1
a kilogram maybe: 1
additions to the: 1
monopoly that thereby: 1
good additions to: 1
i just have: 1
decent out of: 1
was reading on: 1
panic professor mcgonagall: 1
super beltpack of: 1
of room inside: 1
the giant heaps: 1
what ten thousand: 1
bribe me what: 1
okay just let: 1
hold gringotts to: 1
hogwarts can keep: 1
couldn't take time: 1
the door are: 1
the goblin griphook: 1
harry was standing: 1
eternally in the: 1
reasonable i am: 1
additional hundred galleons: 1
might not have: 1
less interesting still: 1
one or two: 1
of a giant: 1
potter you think: 1
any but goblin: 1
it was seventeen: 1
professor mcgonagall it's: 1
great jingling noise: 1
be worth any: 1
seigniorage what said: 1
ton of sickles: 1
the vault mcgonagall: 1
seemed to slump: 1
charm and undetectable: 1
happy day when: 1
make some sort: 1
system works i'm: 1
of an old: 1
it does it: 1
world optimization heaps: 1
their way is: 1
charm can hold: 1
never mind a: 1
case he ever: 1
did see some: 1
of delight upon: 1
absently not at: 1
actually smaller than: 1
i cannot deny: 1
reached twenty mcgonagall: 1
see some things: 1
family mr potter: 1
going to have: 1
coins wide in: 1
vault he had: 1
or 2 million: 1
i'll want one: 1
cup of coffee: 1
interesting harry said: 1
finally what hissed: 1
as a trunk: 1
the deal a: 1
three books i: 1
left you here: 1
didn't waver and: 1
it right away: 1
very quickly in: 1
i was reading: 1
i are going: 1
assemble something decent: 1
fee mr potter-evans-verres: 1
much earlier that: 1
philosopher's stone harry: 1
it a twentieth: 1
knife you could: 1
possible causes fine: 1
thousand pounds even: 1
be cheaper rule: 1
you mentioned earlier: 1
would have to: 1
or anything but: 1
rain on my: 1
mr potter -: 1
philosopher's stone griphook: 1
father was the: 1
away this notion: 1
the top three: 1
i know rowling: 1
trailed off hopefully: 1
casually against the: 1
have told me: 1
and terrible that: 1
bronze knuts harry: 1
harry mcgonagall looked: 1
people with books: 1
mr potter i: 1
locked gazes with: 1
they died is: 1
could smile and: 1
word to whoever: 1
with a retrieval: 1
that's the last: 1
suit his near-term: 1
earned by me: 1
things existed and: 1
one galleon either: 1
pure metal harry: 1
expensive mr potter: 1
even starbucks would: 1
batman's utility belt: 1
that i'm accusing: 1
surely this is: 1
were in their: 1
have the top: 1
heard of arbitrage: 1
little spending money: 1
give me a: 1
make good additions: 1
the weight of: 1
you can bribe: 1
than you started: 1
on the way: 1
the logic of: 1
had a week: 1
mow a lawn: 1
harry said his: 1
only a fool: 1
mcgonagall's face grew: 1
math and science: 1
sharp teeth only: 1
very sharp teeth: 1
any more than: 1
a 'mokeskin pouch': 1
and stepped back: 1
the integrity of: 1
fee where would: 1
those bounties might: 1
not like that: 1
mcgonagall growled there: 1
of that size: 1
yet i'm not: 1
in your head: 1
gold to the: 1
from the giant: 1
twenty coins wide: 1
utility belt of: 1
to silver ratio: 1
the muggle world: 1
the metal would: 1
knuts harry stood: 1
ugly phrase i: 1
of the vault: 1
that literally stored: 1
a kilogram so: 1
collects seigniorage what: 1
hold on i'm: 1
add another ten: 1
hesitated some of: 1
insides hold more: 1
but still what: 1
to relax slightly: 1
consistent value and: 1
against his pants-leg: 1
is their way: 1
all about reasonable: 1
slightly i was: 1
superiors give me: 1
and i just: 1
vault in the: 1
that thereby collects: 1
harry squeaked and: 1
stood there and: 1
get the use: 1
archetypal are these: 1
being ungrateful or: 1
inconsistent in the: 1
more silver than: 1
think it does: 1
going to be: 1
things on the: 1
was roughly a: 1
make the deal: 1
of holding never: 1
have a decent: 1
lean casually against: 1
this really is: 1
that doesn't square: 1
want to store: 1
i did see: 1
or two other: 1
not at all: 1
existed and that: 1
many questions he: 1
potter and perhaps: 1
more than the: 1
of arbitraging away: 1
there was a: 1
said slowly so: 1
going to regret: 1
of the cube: 1
set in there: 1
with books right: 1
another minute of: 1
snide remark about: 1
only is the: 1
so a galleon: 1
the gold to: 1
near-term requirements harry: 1
but oh professor: 1
harry didn't think: 1
of it don't: 1
harry said the: 1
than 5 away: 1
army knife you: 1
him seeming to: 1
the next two: 1
well pay for: 1
a monopoly that: 1
of seventeen sickles: 1

a wand and: 1
door of the: 1
the silver coins: 1
somewhere around fifty: 1
yes i definitely: 1
good enough that: 1
have in their: 1
sure interesting harry: 1
the apparent purchasing: 1
doing it anyway: 1
said sounding somewhat: 1
with mcgonagall engaging: 1
it looked like: 1
against the wall: 1
of the base: 1
as a fraction: 1
math thing named: 1
a trunk like: 1
waver and just: 1
any rate so: 1
course said griphook: 1
arbitrage the larger: 1
grownup when instead: 1
from just outside: 1
those too it's: 1
twenty mcgonagall coughed: 1
things i might: 1
about the crudity: 1
wands thanks to: 1
way i mean: 1
hedge fundie could: 1
the whole wizarding: 1
hold more than: 1
in their vault: 1
so many questions: 1
galleons weighed a: 1
after enrico fermi: 1
bemused i mean: 1
but goblin coin: 1
away wouldn't it: 1
mini sf amp: 1
afford one it: 1
a happy day: 1
the galleon but: 1
sounding somewhat alarmed: 1
without any more: 1
to have them: 1
from - i: 1
at all times: 1
you had to: 1
impossible to maintain: 1
i discover all: 1
to one galleon: 1
when i discover: 1
one later harry: 1
the finer points: 1
off hopefully mcgonagall's: 1
to suit his: 1
consult my superiors: 1
mokeskin pouch with: 1
where you had: 1
defeating the most: 1
their vault in: 1
pounds to the: 1
seeming to lean: 1
from the muggle: 1
at all sorry: 1
a fee mr: 1
of pure gold: 1
was favoring harry: 1
worlds the novels: 1
items or books: 1
puzzled perhaps not: 1
stone griphook hissed: 1
last heir of: 1
money for a: 1
to the muggle: 1
coins was a: 1
i just want: 1
what hissed the: 1
out to explore: 1
kilogram so a: 1
a test of: 1
rich which a: 1
that harry squeaked: 1
was the last: 1
number of items: 1
be getting them: 1
the potter vault: 1
coin them or: 1
- family tradition: 1
hand one competent: 1
griphook who was: 1
own innocent childhood: 1
silver than you: 1
mcgonagall swallowed the: 1
whole weight griphook's: 1
for the first: 1
have to spend: 1
a galleon would: 1
things wizarding for: 1
watched him seeming: 1
so every time: 1
said griphook and: 1
stared at harry: 1
spend the next: 1
mcgonagall it's in: 1
to maintain the: 1
sense mine that: 1
money like you: 1
a heap of: 1
you from where: 1
i'm an adult: 1
had been placed: 1
can assemble something: 1
library i'm going: 1
be around one-third: 1
sticking with it: 1
by me sort: 1
- harry pleaded: 1
mr potter but: 1
mean i would: 1
elsewhere hold on: 1
reluctantly but a: 1
roughly and there: 1
causes fine you: 1
mcgonagall's gaze didn't: 1
enrico fermi a: 1
that such things: 1
adult i'll want: 1
of money for: 1
some things on: 1
novels seem inconsistent: 1
a whole tool: 1
the crudity of: 1
purchasing power of: 1
you in this: 1
childhood watching the: 1
you okay just: 1
at the family: 1
store in that: 1
i can assemble: 1
than enough to: 1
mcgonagall coughed i: 1
wonder surely you: 1
grown-up purchases harry: 1
surely you would: 1
okay to bribe: 1
speaking hypothetically harry: 1
couple to have: 1
a fool would: 1
would be around: 1
harry said for: 1
prudence and impulse: 1
much would you: 1
pyramidal so it: 1
an ugly phrase: 1
or are they: 1
for one lousy: 1
earlier i think: 1
hand and dumping: 1
potter you are: 1
forward and began: 1
enough to pay: 1
books i could: 1
for old textbooks: 1
you keep in: 1
better on the: 1
quick fermi estimate: 1
just carry a: 1
them cheap and: 1
said his mind: 1
my young face: 1
money either way: 1
out wrong sir: 1
time out to: 1
to that you: 1
in here with: 1
i mean suppose: 1
if that came: 1
a great service: 1
ever mow a: 1
fluctuating trading range: 1
the cube eight: 1
your hands upon: 1
harry said puzzled: 1
from the weight: 1
kilogram maybe and: 1
a palm over: 1
wheeled from the: 1
on board with: 1
of discovering the: 1
of gold galleons: 1
remark about the: 1
financial system but: 1
outsides mcgonagall's face: 1
sickles piles of: 1
the most terrible: 1
frantically hitting up: 1
spending a very: 1
the first time: 1
the best of: 1
said mcgonagall blankly: 1
it's a math: 1
that made sense: 1
the last time: 1
it's the same: 1
reading on me: 1
sense being plopped: 1
mcgonagall but i: 1
take the gold: 1
in that pouch: 1
there or other: 1
around fifty to: 1
harry stumped forward: 1
collected yet i'm: 1
wizarding economy until: 1
for asking professor: 1
of your words: 1
that mr potter: 1
in case he: 1
wizarding economy almost: 1
i could have: 1
ultimate awesomeness batman's: 1
i can have: 1
- books of: 1
for a certain: 1
you would not: 1
on them he'd: 1
would you charge: 1
compared to that: 1
to consult my: 1
sickles made from: 1
my parade surely: 1
smiled with a: 1
heap roughly and: 1
silver ratio somewhere: 1
can bribe me: 1
makes me feel: 1
of money or: 1
mcgonagall shook her: 1
waste another minute: 1
i could afford: 1
didn't know where: 1
so pure it: 1
five british pounds: 1
cheaper rule one: 1
of the wealth: 1
too bad that: 1
enough that i: 1
potter i know: 1
mr potter-evans-verres no: 1
it's in the: 1
their outsides mcgonagall's: 1
ungrateful or anything: 1
was seventeen anyway: 1
little sweeter for: 1
out of money: 1
are a few: 1
want a good: 1
probably own the: 1
i mean i: 1
seemed to relax: 1
5 change the: 1
economy had a: 1
coins aren't supposed: 1
this and i: 1
course sighed mcgonagall: 1
known not that: 1
within the potter: 1
trunk like that: 1
placed on you-know-who: 1
i understand that: 1
away market inefficiencies: 1
impulse control but: 1
very much mr: 1
bad harry smiled: 1
such an ugly: 1
and undetectable extension: 1
hundred galleons mr: 1
just get a: 1
are these coins: 1
bad that he: 1
won't hold gringotts: 1
the middle of: 1
me at all: 1
other it's okay: 1
they issued by: 1
of a kilogram: 1
maybe a mini: 1
galleons or 2: 1
was a look: 1
are called forth: 1
am going to: 1
from the wizarding: 1
but her eyes: 1
getting them cheap: 1
think i can: 1
those are very: 1
more than 5: 1
such you will: 1
a certain grim: 1
prefer to call: 1
one competent hedge: 1
'mokeskin pouch' do: 1
you started with: 1
is a happy: 1
to it a: 1
science library with: 1
would you find: 1
them now my: 1
wizarding world within: 1
of possibly even: 1
like what mcgonagall: 1
their twenties when: 1
the books i: 1
his pants-leg that: 1
hold a number: 1
left without any: 1
very tiny fraction: 1
had reached twenty: 1
face so fearsome: 1
seventeen sickles to: 1
gaze of frank: 1
gold coins guarded: 1
coins out of: 1
few toys compared: 1
bring in a: 1
of silver could: 1
vault ought to: 1
silver so every: 1
the way here: 1
optimization heaps of: 1
an old family: 1
sighed and put: 1
all how your: 1
i'm saying hogwarts: 1
suggested revision world: 1
in fees as: 1
library with me: 1
that makes me: 1
trunk mcgonagall said: 1
are you questioning: 1
market inefficiencies might: 1
now my father: 1
which a quick: 1
your school supplies: 1
to silver so: 1
they left without: 1
of items until: 1
a lawn for: 1
the muggle economy: 1
to the library: 1
well that made: 1
knocking over a: 1
picking up gold: 1
to lay your: 1
children using hand-me-down: 1
could have the: 1
something that implied: 1
make just as: 1
for now at: 1
all things wizarding: 1
so i can: 1
much as a: 1
harry nodded thank: 1
that will be: 1
palm over his: 1
and children using: 1
all the used: 1
goblin his body: 1
i fear i: 1
inside good enough: 1
family tradition yes: 1
of silver change: 1
my life what: 1
to start from: 1
your vault whenever: 1
just let me: 1
weighed a tenth: 1
pay for the: 1
rowling is watching: 1
be lost on: 1
use of it: 1
words though i: 1
almost completely decoupled: 1
had so many: 1
hitting up all: 1
of silver i: 1
next two days: 1
silent staring contest: 1
i was speaking: 1
relax slightly i: 1
pay for your: 1
fermi a way: 1
the use of: 1
week free meanwhile: 1
one it would: 1
if i don't: 1
named after enrico: 1
upon a philosopher's: 1
think it was: 1
were actually smaller: 1
but the sad: 1
over his face: 1
has ever heard: 1
harry trailed off: 1
in the wizarding: 1
goblin griphook who: 1
for you okay: 1
mcgonagall engaging in: 1
worth any more: 1
can't do as: 1
is earned by: 1
griphook's eyes were: 1
to have in: 1
and as such: 1
life what do: 1
of course said: 1
minor and as: 1
trading range of: 1
i would want: 1
wish i could: 1
it was archetypal: 1
was waiting near: 1
teeth only a: 1
back knocking over: 1
gold coins then: 1
that my parents: 1
sad thing is: 1
body which had: 1
in a sense: 1
at harry mcgonagall: 1
this vault and: 1
reasonable withdrawals from: 1
fermi calculation a: 1
toys using an: 1
vaults full of: 1
find a ton: 1
need one of: 1
world if i: 1
defeat him or: 1
a mokeskin pouch: 1
exactly mcgonagall's whole: 1
world if a: 1
goblin watched him: 1
you here and: 1
minute of my: 1
and remember your: 1
i know that: 1
is such an: 1
finer points of: 1
wild guess i: 1
that any of: 1
oh professor mcgonagall: 1
notion in case: 1
a look on: 1
and get the: 1
billion times less: 1
i don't remember: 1
and stared with: 1
be more than: 1
i'm not sure: 1
satisfaction it was: 1
allow you to: 1
gold galleons stacks: 1
thousand british pounds: 1
them or are: 1
in a silent: 1
it don't panic: 1
i came in: 1
the one who: 1
was speaking hypothetically: 1
mcgonagall looked bemused: 1
competent hedge fundie: 1
last time i: 1
mcgonagall blankly griphook: 1
own the whole: 1
potter but oh: 1
bins or better: 1
it's okay to: 1
of gold to: 1
yes but -: 1
of this really: 1
can anyone coin: 1
heir of an: 1
so it would: 1
books of course: 1
is this a: 1
a fluctuating trading: 1
economy almost completely: 1
now at any: 1
would make just: 1
ran out of: 1
i would have: 1
for a suggested: 1
to spend money: 1
fees as a: 1
the wealth that: 1
first time why: 1
coining harry nodded: 1
time i ever: 1
could i will: 1
5 away from: 1
ever known not: 1
bank that literally: 1
pouch don't push: 1
was what ten: 1
smaller than the: 1
sighed mcgonagall you: 1
and began picking: 1
the same money: 1
said harry absently: 1
you very much: 1
them he'd been: 1
way is probably: 1
may add another: 1
pounds a kilogram: 1
to make some: 1
mind a swiss: 1
and repeat wasn't: 1
of the books: 1
i am doing: 1
are made of: 1
at hogwarts -: 1
was a test: 1
act the part: 1
within a week: 1
and was pyramidal: 1
world of being: 1
silver change to: 1
his body which: 1
you will only: 1
sickles to one: 1
collection if i: 1
financial system works: 1
and twenty coins: 1
have noted i'm: 1
and can anyone: 1
would you keep: 1
that pouch don't: 1
any of them: 1
to explore the: 1
though i very: 1
around one-third of: 1
room inside good: 1
it world optimization: 1
of them would: 1
harry said slowly: 1
but i understand: 1
died is this: 1
potter hm harry: 1
economy no one: 1
something decent out: 1
if galleons in: 1
not that i'm: 1
gazes with mcgonagall: 1
a good one: 1
what said mcgonagall: 1
that i earned: 1
thousand galleons per: 1
might want to: 1
and take out: 1
to sickles and: 1
harry filed away: 1
a cup of: 1
i'll make the: 1
coughed i think: 1
occasion harry's fingers: 1
or had a: 1
and perhaps the: 1
control but i: 1
had been taut: 1
showing very sharp: 1
delight upon my: 1
a math thing: 1
pleaded i'm sure: 1
potter - books: 1
a number of: 1
with lots of: 1
them yes i: 1
quickly in your: 1
gold of course: 1
cube eight thousand: 1

crudity of their: 1
gold or silver: 1
the grumpy grownup: 1
of gringotts mr: 1
most terrible wizard: 1
i definitely need: 1
belt of holding: 1
ki- mcgonagall swallowed: 1
said something that: 1
bounties that had: 1
in the void: 1
thing named after: 1
but a mokeskin: 1
than the gold: 1
been taut seemed: 1
great service to: 1
you to withdraw: 1
me feel less: 1
sorry if that: 1
thanks to reviewer: 1
questioning the integrity: 1
of getting rough: 1
i'm sure that: 1
bookstores for old: 1
money in vaults: 1
stone harry said: 1
one of those: 1
stacks of silver: 1
i earned by: 1
know where to: 1
coins then again: 1
a galleon as: 1
then said the: 1
one of economics: 1
gringotts to it: 1
with his mouth: 1
me for asking: 1
is probably better: 1
that's the spirit: 1
with fiscal prudence: 1
the exchange rate: 1
she waits eternally: 1
could afford them: 1
anything but still: 1
should have told: 1
the other when: 1
remember your own: 1
by a monopoly: 1
over a whole: 1
character so pure: 1
look on her: 1
squeaked and stepped: 1
on the other: 1
and left you: 1
even if i: 1
up gold coins: 1
have been collected: 1
that i wouldn't: 1
buy a few: 1
way here which: 1
being plopped in: 1
told me much: 1
value and sticking: 1
pile of gold: 1
guilty about spending: 1
mcgonagall watched him: 1
of being rich: 1
deal a little: 1
i am all: 1
do you say: 1
if you think: 1
to call it: 1
sure that when: 1
out of the: 1
wall but her: 1
and dumping them: 1
he was right: 1
frank respect possibly: 1
on her face: 1
fraction of it: 1
here has ever: 1
if i locked: 1
spend money the: 1
pure it was: 1
put a palm: 1
explore the amazing: 1
the coins aren't: 1
a trunk mcgonagall: 1
push it mr: 1
entire world if: 1
mr potter hm: 1
much wish i: 1
mr potter and: 1
were around five: 1
i will allow: 1
you can't eat: 1
galleons in general: 1
than the metal: 1
get a ton: 1
that i am: 1
money mcgonagall shook: 1
fearsome and terrible: 1
other things i: 1
picking a consistent: 1
a bank that: 1
this a usual: 1
thing is their: 1
and just what: 1
the sad thing: 1
griphook so not: 1
a what mcgonagall: 1
in the apparent: 1
time the muggle: 1
the wizarding world: 1
griphook grinned showing: 1
wealth that i: 1
silver coins were: 1
his ki- mcgonagall: 1
and science library: 1
asking professor mcgonagall: 1
potter-evans-verres the goblin: 1
can afford one: 1
pull one out: 1
the novels seem: 1
and gold was: 1
one out anywhere: 1
professor mcgonagall why: 1
and sprawling backward: 1
young couple to: 1
bring if you: 1
or other magic: 1
earlier that such: 1
remember seeing one: 1
maintain the exchange: 1
interesting still that's: 1
to withdraw an: 1
your own innocent: 1
began picking up: 1
day when i: 1
of silver sickles: 1
for more silver: 1
terrible that harry: 1
wouldn't it it's: 1
a billion times: 1
standing in a: 1
stared with his: 1
with it i: 1
fine you may: 1
made of pure: 1
whose insides hold: 1
i locked you: 1
mcgonagall hesitated some: 1
one and i: 1
for your school: 1
i'll never have: 1
gringotts mr potter-evans-verres: 1
other magic items: 1
your financial system: 1
or silver should: 1
wizarding world if: 1
lawn for one: 1
magic items or: 1
here cost five: 1
supposed to be: 1
works i'm asking: 1
void between worlds: 1
griphook was favoring: 1
plopped in front: 1
mcgonagall's whole body: 1
one hand and: 1
swiss army knife: 1
still what are: 1
of my life: 1
middle of discovering: 1
me at hogwarts: 1
there and stared: 1
totally on board: 1
coin in other: 1
with and repeat: 1
be doing a: 1
just as much: 1
body seemed to: 1
sf amp f: 1
piles of bronze: 1
and impulse control: 1
or better yet: 1
wanted to spend: 1
never have to: 1
of sickles made: 1
of arbitrage the: 1
up griphook stared: 1
be expecting to: 1
of it right: 1
might defeat him: 1
world of magic: 1
gold coins looked: 1
insignificant fraction of: 1
who emplaced them: 1
his mouth open: 1
mcgonagall said reluctantly: 1
slump i fear: 1
in this vault: 1
mean suppose i: 1
harry absently not: 1
finally trunks whose: 1
hm harry said: 1
about fifty british: 1
good one with: 1
high and twenty: 1
stacks of gold: 1
buy - mr: 1
harry's fingers tapped: 1
professor mcgonagall mr: 1
you may add: 1
this money may: 1
just what would: 1
does it can't: 1
but that doesn't: 1
reviewer elldenstorm for: 1
cost five thousand: 1
how your financial: 1
is the wizarding: 1
regret this and: 1
hogwarts - and: 1
and there were: 1
another ten galleons: 1
elldenstorm for a: 1
payable to his: 1
would be cheaper: 1
like that i'm: 1
said reluctantly but: 1
to go in: 1
and i are: 1
he didn't know: 1
drained from the: 1
to slump i: 1
estimate said was: 1
to wizarding britain: 1
if a cup: 1
in there or: 1
britain mr potter: 1
in either dimension: 1
to just get: 1
the last heir: 1
way of getting: 1
lost on them: 1
galleon would be: 1
still that's the: 1
sort of snide: 1
do as much: 1
that you mcgonagall: 1
he ever ran: 1
economy until it: 1
mine that is: 1
gold galleons weighed: 1
in a bank: 1
said the goblin: 1
more than enough: 1
me much earlier: 1
had a fluctuating: 1
stern those are: 1
are they issued: 1
just have no: 1
i might want: 1
i wouldn't have: 1
galleons griphook was: 1
to one harry: 1
to pay for: 1
every time the: 1
sickles for galleons: 1
with a gaze: 1
will allow you: 1
lousy pound harry: 1
mouth open at: 1
of the grumpy: 1
or books i: 1

buy it now: 1
grinned showing very: 1
they are called: 1
the muggle gold-to-silver: 1
galleons mr potter: 1
that is earned: 1
silver sickles piles: 1
watched him with: 1
jingling noise and: 1
his near-term requirements: 1
galleons take the: 1
in vaults full: 1
the bargain bins: 1
how much would: 1
beltpack of ultimate: 1
about spending a: 1

would constitute sensible: 1
i'm accusing you: 1
upon my young: 1
get a better: 1
the heaps stacks: 1
let me buy: 1
one-third of the: 1

british pounds not: 1
my father and: 1
no idea at: 1

so how much: 1
stepped back knocking: 1
and i can: 1

why act the: 1
much sense to: 1
from where she: 1
you think that: 1

in other words: 1
instead you could: 1
of ultimate awesomeness: 1
anywhere i'll never: 1

with the power: 1
near-scream from outside: 1
away out the: 1
her expression chilly: 1
byway and down: 1
an undetectable extension: 1
groveling i'm hoping: 1
should guess house: 1
circumstance and context: 1
was such pure: 1
hand as if: 1
you for what: 1
malkin's senses so: 1
be angry at: 1
the wall and: 1
pointing at a: 1
force of chaos: 1
like he was: 1
byway off a: 1
and harry's right: 1
talking as fast: 1
explained by circumstance: 1
not know about: 1

it is contagious: 1
and turned her: 1

been awkwardly carrying: 1
we explain by: 1
the man who: 1
at mcgonagall do: 1
work and then: 1
to clean your: 1
harry wished he: 1
trying to figure: 1
couldn't blame mcgonagall: 1
world defeater of: 1
mcgonagall looked around: 1
she won't let: 1
on the basis: 1
moke shop was: 1
understandable enough tell: 1
harry burbled on: 1
why they wouldn't: 1
can i have: 1
sorry for asking: 1
so so honored: 1
the nearest byway: 1
well-wishers along the: 1
up so i: 1
not robes that: 1
harry suggested can: 1
wearing are your: 1
the most ravenclaw: 1
reasonable explanations he: 1
harry had surreptitiously: 1
to harry a: 1
he let his: 1
considered the question: 1
real accident but: 1
the one who'd: 1
in mid-sentence his: 1
the assistants the: 1
was a bustling: 1

such pure horror: 1
that you're alive: 1
- i never: 1

words end quote: 1
pouch as soon: 1
man who had: 1
sounded to you: 1
you-know-who because i'm: 1
explanation harry paused: 1
in a mood: 1
put it that: 1
are muggles and: 1
elegant in black: 1
them in one: 1
regarded him harry: 1
up in ravenclaw: 1
left hand to: 1
automatically and then: 1
off the obfuscation: 1
the respect due: 1
done and harry: 1
i never thought: 1
the moke shop: 1
at that he: 1
girl seemed about: 1
were honest though: 1
be treated with: 1
ensconced behind a: 1
very angry what: 1
warring in his: 1
sort of wistful: 1
case you know: 1
but we don't: 1
bit queasy and: 1
harry her expression: 1
mcgonagall's voice was: 1
managed to steal: 1
coming here straight: 1
a building across: 1
who was still: 1
his heart twinged: 1
that girl seemed: 1
do with you: 1
of a deadly: 1
in a split: 1
deadly weapon just: 1
they ran into: 1
already sufficient cause: 1
i should be: 1
i said fundamental: 1
situation and we: 1
fading yellow robes: 1
tightly holding some: 1
knew she wouldn't: 1
think i understand: 1
horror tall white-haired: 1
a quaint little: 1
rowling is staring: 1
from gringotts it: 1
i've heard so: 1
he was wearing: 1
a corner of: 1
drink which i: 1
gave harry a: 1
you might be: 1
robes not robes: 1
go off for: 1
of sweat from: 1
that he thinks: 1
don't you go: 1
and couldn't blame: 1
him to withdraw: 1
kind of great: 1
eyes widened shocked: 1
people's stories make: 1
j k rowling: 1
deliciously forbidden but: 1
error is that: 1
you again it: 1
quite know with: 1
of malkin's two: 1
for feeling the: 1
shake the hand: 1
professor mcgonagall cried: 1
this is a: 1
boy and the: 1
again mcgonagall chuckled: 1
wistful sigh your: 1
this day nay: 1
and grim harry: 1
in his voice: 1
said with fierce: 1
quaint little shop: 1

glass of wine: 1
of slytherin i've: 1
slowly tapped away: 1

and then cracked: 1
in the air: 1
her hands and: 1
harry had insisted: 1
which i desperately: 1
more well-wishers along: 1
should be honored: 1
you get fitted: 1

eyes widened with: 1
the door formed: 1
that you are: 1

to relax that: 1
them in the: 1
and with a: 1
- you'd do: 1
composed people i: 1
draco glared in: 1
into her shop: 1
was silence mcgonagall: 1
first shutupshutupshutup i'm: 1
loudly for the: 1
the least of: 1
be he let: 1

tear sliding down: 1
counter in front: 1

said in front: 1
holding out a: 1
with a bad: 1
as soon as: 1
three iterations to: 1
'get fitted for: 1
professor mcgonagall burst: 1
tell of in: 1
fitted for robes': 1
demonic force of: 1
been happening here: 1
of wine that: 1
the most composed: 1
but harry wasn't: 1

strangling but kept: 1
madam malkin's next: 1
oh come on: 1

right through your: 1
cut off abruptly: 1
for a few: 1
really survive the: 1
ourselves we see: 1
usually started crying: 1
attribution error is: 1
the white-haired boy: 1
the right place: 1
for robes' sounded: 1
standing side-by-side their: 1
would be angry: 1
since harry had: 1
loose galleons and: 1
me what said: 1
around harry protested: 1
so inexpressibly delighted: 1
that was on: 1
the way to: 1
house myself just: 1
putting the coin-bag: 1

great lucius malfoy: 1
that harry had: 1
guessed he'd managed: 1
woman wearing fading: 1
attention to me: 1
malkin looked back: 1
upon this day: 1
approving madam malkin: 1
of malkin's assistants: 1
a conjecture mcgonagall: 1
suspicion and how: 1
fitted sir might: 1
old mysterious man: 1
lord by being: 1
to know what: 1
him to believe: 1
say a word: 1
though your wish: 1
mcgonagall looked back: 1
was having trouble: 1
drops of alcohol: 1
ones that raised: 1
just a routine: 1
hogwarts with madam: 1
said that did: 1
off the words: 1
then there was: 1
the other slytherins: 1
thing ever since: 1
that you didn't: 1
breathing heavily what: 1
have sounded a: 1
you from my: 1
hair seemed to: 1
murderous eyes regarded: 1

the byway and: 1
sudden flurry of: 1
effective against more: 1

i would guess: 1
boy with a: 1
coins into the: 1
knowing what was: 1
angry what are: 1

inhabits you it: 1
pale young boy: 1
mother lily's eyes: 1
what they would: 1
meant mcgonagall shook: 1
it was clear: 1
might be sorted: 1
grinned sheepishly professor: 1
even then she: 1
emitted a sound: 1
his voice like: 1
to come from: 1
dropped the bag: 1
to them harry: 1
brief silence then: 1
nothing else i: 1
into the nearest: 1
a fiery passion: 1
those clothes you're: 1
you ever done: 1
ask an unwarranted: 1
be better explained: 1
and buying a: 1
work lifting draco's: 1
his pocket mcgonagall: 1
i mean you: 1
upon the least: 1
he thought he: 1
some things i: 1
a spur-of-the-moment thing: 1
a few minutes: 1
different situation so: 1
she saw the: 1
and i don't: 1
knees on the: 1
that i'm the: 1
sense - no: 1
enough mr potter: 1
entire universe he: 1
you alone now: 1
seemed about to: 1
i grow up: 1
unwarranted familiarity with: 1
but harry managed: 1
outside the shop: 1
you'd have any: 1
as possible but: 1
a little confused: 1
being more terrible: 1
fire madam malkin: 1
pouch reaching in: 1
a sudden flurry: 1
on with her: 1
going to get: 1
or flinching and: 1
with a tinge: 1
had a sense: 1
face lightened somewhat: 1
turn away and: 1
dragged him out: 1
what happened in: 1
auto-thieved harry looked: 1
the same way: 1
harry considered the: 1
examining the medium: 1
really happened i: 1
cut off the: 1
no no sir: 1
apparently and one: 1
malkin's robes it: 1
being born his: 1
lord murmured mcgonagall: 1
circumstances that explain: 1
here madam malkin: 1
of alcohol now: 1
at least that: 1
the shopkeeper moved: 1
into flames and: 1
well everyone did: 1
that he was: 1
with the respect: 1
you saying mr: 1
harry was having: 1
mcgonagall said the: 1
insisted as hard: 1

whispered harry it: 1
as well as: 1
carefully examining the: 1
remember and i've: 1
it mcgonagall strode: 1
robe with her: 1
laughter and that: 1
the shop until: 1
figure out how: 1
smug smile it's: 1
was carefully examining: 1
moment strolled in: 1
wasn't in a: 1
seemed that mcgonagall's: 1
the allowed bag: 1
the door was: 1
and they're the: 1
traits that explain: 1
- mcgonagall drew: 1
laughter went on: 1
suspicious harry had: 1
notice anything though: 1
my name was: 1
voice i know: 1
meet you harry: 1
to go and: 1
put into the: 1
on the floor: 1
his eyes widen: 1
the air we: 1

into diagon alley: 1
explain their behavior: 1
i'd be so: 1

mcgonagall slowly turned: 1
shop mcgonagall's voice: 1
an unwarranted familiarity: 1

forward into the: 1
the year he: 1
sigh your flattery: 1
murmured thank you: 1

ran into two: 1
her voice calm: 1
pouch without getting: 1
assistants harry sighed: 1
with a fiery: 1
was behind a: 1
in case you: 1
potter came a: 1
and not in: 1
black robes not: 1

silence mcgonagall looked: 1
said after meeting: 1
a vegetable stand: 1

with a whisper: 1
like my father: 1

draco malfoy looking: 1
to hide i'm: 1
but what does: 1
the byway seemed: 1
assistants one of: 1
maybe thirty galleons: 1
- self-stolen auto-thieved: 1
word that came: 1
said draco sounding: 1
heard from you: 1
and raise him: 1
on harry's shoulder: 1
robes mcgonagall said: 1
they aren't even: 1
was less than: 1
wall again mcgonagall: 1

shouted at him: 1
she'd heard harry: 1
because i heard: 1

if to touch: 1
my hand harry: 1
a child -: 1
legend so much: 1
draco malfoy poor: 1
rowling rays he's: 1
muffled choking sound: 1
to put into: 1
straight away first: 1
flinching and she: 1

over on its: 1
a sort of: 1
people i knew: 1
in her hand: 1
just in case: 1
fitted for clothes: 1

light the one: 1
what was coming: 1
stretched in a: 1
of gold coins: 1

he was and: 1
kings might bestow: 1
open as if: 1
seized draco and: 1
were only swiftly: 1
slowly turned to: 1
said in a: 1
that subject were: 1
it was a: 1
an irony leavening: 1
i think i: 1
like no one: 1

i suppose you: 1
worry him a: 1
madam malkin's shop: 1
extension charm you: 1
draco the harry: 1

suggested can i: 1
do with as: 1
reached into the: 1
of his mouth: 1
taking off the: 1
other in duplicate: 1
for the rest: 1
go back and: 1
saying in one: 1
attended hogwarts except: 1
on fire madam: 1
of her assistants: 1
who wants to: 1
lucius malfoy and: 1
father lucius before: 1
just because i: 1
their heads swiveled: 1
rowena herself would: 1
though poor eh: 1
i've had this: 1
your autograph no: 1
bit of sweat: 1
to notice anything: 1
burst into flames: 1
might have been: 1
reading your mind: 1
in perfect unison: 1
was never one: 1
it's not like: 1
personality people don't: 1
man to whom: 1

fiery passion and: 1
a wall on: 1
thinks when we: 1
took on the: 1
dispassionate quality of: 1
see them in: 1
inside but we: 1
had a widening: 1
rather indeed snapped: 1
mostly brick that: 1
lobbed back accompanied: 1
but then let: 1
scourge of gryffindor: 1
two poor assistants: 1
seemed to serve: 1
expect to be: 1
trying this routine: 1
house do you: 1
so totally trying: 1
to find madam: 1
mcgonagall an irony: 1
the robe with: 1
didn't really survive: 1
anyone else bother: 1
then shouted at: 1
most composed people: 1
alone that you: 1

dark lord murmured: 1
damn harry was: 1
the gold coins: 1
asking i should: 1
showing plain black: 1
much about you: 1
check up on: 1
lords too -: 1
dropped in again: 1
and from the: 1
a near-scream from: 1
finally mcgonagall seemed: 1
and survived the: 1
i'll leave you: 1
the word that: 1
ever heard from: 1
and very approving: 1
himself but the: 1
that sort of: 1
in through the: 1
experienced magical practitioners: 1
holding some of: 1

whispering bag of: 1
her two poor: 1
irony leavening her: 1
as he thought: 1

that means and: 1
she was one: 1
power to vanquish: 1
opposite madam malkin: 1

fell against the: 1
but kept on: 1
with as the: 1
harry coughed actually: 1
slytherin house myself: 1
what are those: 1
and we don't: 1
sheepishly professor mcgonagall: 1
forbidden but just: 1
until she was: 1

cloth that seemed: 1
be just like: 1
more experienced magical: 1
the moke super: 1
her head no: 1
corner of the: 1
harry sighed it: 1
it's only my: 1
or i thought: 1

whispered the old: 1
the street which: 1
screaming in horror: 1
a byway off: 1

coins reached into: 1
came out of: 1
that rowena herself: 1
hard enough to: 1
some might even: 1
great or i: 1
galleons from himself: 1

mokeskin pouch with: 1
her hand over: 1
arms to carefully: 1
clothes you're wearing: 1

about me i: 1
his stern face: 1

just unutterably delighted: 1
was in a: 1
in exasperation you: 1
them harry looked: 1
of bitterness care: 1
floor giggling hysterically: 1
decided in a: 1
followed but at: 1
how should they: 1
perfectly effective against: 1
draco malfoy i: 1
people have told: 1

gasped draco the: 1
question of how: 1

up wiped a: 1
items in the: 1
can expect to: 1
going to go: 1
to carefully remove: 1
hero harry potter: 1

pouch qx31 on: 1
months old at: 1
alley mcgonagall looked: 1
definitely related to: 1
what have you: 1
or tighten hello: 1
him anyone would: 1

diagon alley mcgonagall: 1
made internal sense: 1
be going through: 1

and do that: 1
slytherin house too: 1
that set off: 1
the most honored: 1
house hufflepuff or: 1
plan lucius malfoy: 1
this is one: 1
as though performing: 1
total volume was: 1
he said with: 1
son has been: 1
'what an angry: 1

loosen or tighten: 1
from you-know-who mcgonagall: 1
to hogwarts with: 1

robe shut up: 1
his but they: 1
whisper of bag: 1
on the way: 1

expression tense and: 1
can attest on: 1
at hogwarts i: 1
awesomecool blonde-white hair: 1
mr potter by: 1
attribution error you'd: 1

the next person: 1
poor madam malkin: 1
expect to find: 1
harry's right hand: 1
a hand as: 1
from the inside: 1
at some of: 1
enough good heavens: 1
not meant to: 1
draco's arms to: 1
but the byway: 1
paying attention to: 1
kind of permanent: 1
feeling the same: 1
when she saw: 1
galleons next to: 1
huge tear sliding: 1
people think that: 1
you did i'll: 1
a set of: 1
and mcgonagall pushed: 1
are you i: 1
at harry her: 1
how do you: 1
and harry guessed: 1
malkin who was: 1
so anyway -: 1

blonde-white hair seemed: 1
wooden keg and: 1
expression chilly i: 1
here and nothing: 1
said kindly why: 1

sounding slightly impressed: 1
black robes -: 1
muggles two of: 1
him a little: 1
oops that last: 1
and then the: 1
stand that was: 1
conspiracy there's no: 1
by being in: 1
which showed the: 1
sounding a little: 1
he could make: 1
the mouth leading: 1
i remember being: 1
of the finest: 1
one split second: 1
you never did: 1
i was fifteen: 1
you i should: 1
galleons that harry: 1
vanquish the dark: 1
you saying in: 1
and then there: 1
of the dark: 1

the boy hogwarts: 1
while you get: 1
red like ordinary: 1
executioner a man: 1

the adults that: 1
to check up: 1
his own tape-measure-draped: 1
mcgonagall paused breathing: 1
you're not used: 1
examining the white-haired: 1
didn't seem to: 1
eyes hmm harry: 1
goodbye to them: 1
assistant when that: 1
let his eyes: 1
too harry observed: 1
a hand and: 1
the wall wheezing: 1
need to be: 1
a smug smile: 1
alley the shopkeeper: 1
attendant emitted a: 1
a routine activity: 1
terrible than death: 1
the counter in: 1
see through the: 1
in one situation: 1
of cloth that: 1
animated writhing bits: 1
said draco malfoy: 1
hard as he: 1
changed or spun: 1
and face the: 1
this but harry: 1
with her work: 1
what bellowed lucius: 1
very year it: 1
i knew about: 1
somewhat though your: 1
harry grinned sheepishly: 1
if you-know-who himself: 1
not well done: 1
a bit queasy: 1
exhaled i'd like: 1
sweat from his: 1
genuinely boring storefront: 1
slightly puzzled it: 1
point oh said: 1
heavily what part: 1

she was strangling: 1
accompanied by a: 1
opportunity though it'd: 1
be seen finally: 1
gold retrieved the: 1

magical practitioners mcgonagall: 1
charm on the: 1

to you like: 1
swoon oops that: 1
mcgonagall paused outside: 1
saviour of the: 1
from himself harry: 1

mid-sentence his face: 1

the glorious saviour: 1
looked back silently: 1
them mcgonagall's eyebrows: 1
to go right: 1
a deadly weapon: 1
hogwarts in your: 1
heavier harry and: 1
in a smug: 1
through the window: 1
hogwarts except that: 1
harry said kindly: 1
all right with: 1
was hitting on: 1
he decided in: 1
harry guessed he'd: 1
from one another: 1
few drops of: 1
the floor giggling: 1
spell was less: 1
of groveling i'm: 1
charm you could: 1
gold coins reached: 1
pleased to meet: 1
her eyes on: 1
mcgonagall in perfect: 1
- what are: 1
want a picture: 1
way to work: 1

replacing deadly threat: 1
side-by-side their heads: 1
a similar process: 1
into a wall: 1
on draco said: 1

of chaos inhabits: 1
a picture with: 1

your name sir: 1
mcgonagall said how: 1
a different situation: 1
to end up: 1
next person who: 1
old man one: 1
in a different: 1
exasperation you look: 1
to serve as: 1
reaching in whispering: 1
door formed a: 1
james the year: 1
harry but then: 1
wished he could: 1
make tears come: 1
and for you: 1
i was only: 1
let anyone else: 1
was not a: 1
an angry person: 1
set of animated: 1
idea what that: 1
you where are: 1
he'd managed to: 1
boy cut off: 1
that we explain: 1
house elf harry: 1
drew her hand: 1
sighed i suppose: 1
in slytherin house: 1
swiftly striding passersby: 1
you it is: 1
from his forehead: 1
no one else: 1
flurry of action: 1
i've got no: 1
checkerboard robe shut: 1
gold into the: 1
a little i: 1
that you have: 1
muggles and they're: 1
return i think: 1
though the total: 1
what really happened: 1
tape measures and: 1
mcgonagall's eyebrows drew: 1
things i was: 1
up harry suggested: 1
as the highest: 1
you could actually: 1
think that i: 1
started crying at: 1
defeat dark lords: 1
on you she's: 1
was holding out: 1
store that was: 1
i don't know: 1
be honored to: 1
a step away: 1
highest of kings: 1
clothing might be: 1
but when we: 1
hitting on draco: 1
still left the: 1
annoyance and frustration: 1
shouldn't he said: 1
even knowing what: 1
of the gold: 1
the golden coins: 1
frustration that enough: 1
where those actions: 1
in it though: 1
you the great: 1
please cast a: 1
observed no quavered: 1
thought he could: 1
for what you: 1
a rescue plan: 1
tape-measure-draped body i'm: 1
which confirmed this: 1
eyebrows drew up: 1
that professor mcgonagall: 1
at him once: 1
as the sounds: 1
no reason why: 1
understand yes harry: 1
should they not: 1
place one of: 1
potter gosh i've: 1
no idea who: 1
much so that: 1
me they aren't: 1
that explain their: 1
across the street: 1
joking around harry: 1
voice was reminiscent: 1
hand to be: 1
try this for: 1
about you from: 1
to steal maybe: 1
said slowly but: 1
character of a: 1
who you are: 1
to do that: 1
saying mr potter: 1
horror too loudly: 1
when he put: 1
one huge tear: 1
internal sense -: 1
who are you: 1
at least it: 1
you not know: 1
jingling would seem: 1
potter i am: 1
man low and: 1
mcgonagall pushed their: 1
innocence sure enough: 1
harry did not: 1
parents are muggles: 1
she shot a: 1
your robes mcgonagall: 1
a pointed face: 1
bag then the: 1
original bag then: 1
two recoiled from: 1
sir draco malfoy: 1
to shake the: 1
reminiscent and very: 1
hogwarts i guess: 1
thinking of trying: 1
about trying to: 1
one ever heard: 1
the other items: 1
quavered the old: 1
one to discard: 1
sound harry burbled: 1
potter mcgonagall said: 1
i desperately need: 1
sign then harry: 1
house too usually: 1
of personality alone: 1
behind a vegetable: 1
harry potter pleased: 1
you go and: 1
to such a: 1
the time i: 1
to be dropped: 1
the words in: 1
to their knees: 1
enough was enough: 1
wide open as: 1
to get sorted: 1
but i would: 1
was that it: 1
at you can: 1
about to say: 1
bestow upon the: 1
you didn't really: 1
your son has: 1
expression of boyish: 1
her head to: 1
pocket so that: 1
hardly even knowing: 1
got out a: 1
hand his right: 1
on a byway: 1
even paying attention: 1
harry when she: 1
that harry nodded: 1
he was in: 1
white-haired coldly elegant: 1
all about you: 1
your boots rather: 1
of permanent enduring: 1
lightened somewhat though: 1
step away and: 1
wizarding orphan and: 1
happened but i: 1
you know something: 1
a low voice: 1
harry reached up: 1
undetectable extension charm: 1
wish nothing more: 1
way mcgonagall paused: 1
but they were: 1
paused breathing heavily: 1
a silver-handled cane: 1
to put the: 1

in whispering bag: 1
of gold into: 1

lily's eyes and: 1
so i'm taking: 1
though it'd really: 1
a way that: 1
even say cute: 1
dark lord by: 1
the question of: 1
harry dropped the: 1
after ten repetitions: 1
wine that had: 1
sighed it was: 1
harry managed to: 1
a moke super: 1
me harry said: 1
he looked at: 1
your flattery was: 1
the sounds of: 1
one another as: 1
and dragged him: 1
set to work: 1
enough to do: 1
the hand of: 1
mcgonagall and sighed: 1
fifteen galleons lighter: 1
against more experienced: 1
less than perfectly: 1
confused then his: 1
it though the: 1
for clothes harry: 1
need you are: 1
malfoy and professor: 1

abruptly there was: 1
back to check: 1

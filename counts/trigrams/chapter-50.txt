that was magic: 1
what the result: 1
to pursue her: 1
to her on: 1
back and looked: 1
some young and: 1
through her she: 1
patil but something: 1
she stared at: 1
still wasn't sure: 1
of dramatic irony: 1
roomed in the: 1
it again to: 1
a ravenclaw student: 1
her whole life: 1
rightly between light: 1
a louder hiss: 1
yourself will you: 1
what you just: 1
everyone could hear: 1

and when her: 1
a whispery chuckle: 1
when i found: 1
twin padma patil: 1

flitwick paused seeming: 1
low and the: 1
hat never called: 1

looked at entwhistle: 1
hiss that sounded: 1
if you stay: 1
her with questions: 1
your herbology homework: 1
offense that is: 1
the two of: 1

year and try: 1
life to be: 1
dry amusement in: 1
you think hermione: 1
parkinson not padma: 1
sounded almost like: 1
sweet merlin exclaimed: 1
and just as: 1
it could distract: 1
that harry said: 1
consequences to what: 1
them why padma: 1
could into her: 1
to talk about: 1
threaten her or: 1
lomillialor - let: 1
three tries before: 1
shine in the: 1
of the rules: 1
like the way: 1
the proud slytherin: 1
by himself like: 1
such as i: 1
ravenclaw dorms with: 1
padma malfoy she: 1
with their own: 1
what said padma: 1

in public where: 1
flitwick really think: 1

for the last: 1
things about hermione: 1
chilling charm and: 1
that way actually: 1
points a little: 1
rehearse potions recipes: 1

was only line-of-sight: 1
evil twin padma: 1
she thought about: 1

on the way: 1
or caused you: 1
with parvati which: 1
will not hurt: 1
ally already knew: 1
to ignore it: 1
nice as she: 1

plan you are: 1
that few ever: 1
should say but: 1

considering that it: 1
nine-tenths of the: 1
class and she: 1
a house you: 1

patronus charm that: 1
then the door: 1

last night padma: 1
soft laugh harry: 1
up caring for: 1
as i could: 1
close to her: 1
and she saw: 1
hermione granger is: 1

he is wavering: 1
her why does: 1
hurt still that: 1
certain of it: 1
from lunch he: 1
her face um: 1
and i made: 1
looking up from: 1
a six-inch essay: 1
around and strode: 1
wand when she: 1
you won't come: 1
if padma thinks: 1
- not to: 1

wand already snatched: 1
light shot out: 1
them why and: 1
quite loud in: 1
they don't care: 1
girl you choose: 1
you are throwing: 1
when she took: 1
how many people: 1
i should get: 1

too late hermione: 1

he had to: 1
be 'i'm sorry: 1
and looked in: 1
to hear and: 1
just dead people: 1
for harry potter: 1
harry potter walked: 1
wavering but you: 1
she could into: 1
it had been: 1
she could comprehend: 1
she'd heard those: 1
in a voice: 1
beween light and: 1
decided that the: 1
corner at the: 1
that is is: 1
how much it: 1
the normal slytherin: 1
professor flitwick really: 1
i've got to: 1
had been a: 1
potter couldn't possibly: 1
padma's throat was: 1

the whispering sigh: 1
he would ever: 1
go out to: 1
on lomillialor wood: 1
michael corner rehearse: 1
that it was: 1
to my dorm: 1
a sadder whisper: 1
which lit with: 1
not hurt you: 1

to do the: 1
like you did: 1
padma patil on: 1
she is not: 1
she took a: 1
think the other: 1
own lives so: 1
whispering sigh came: 1
anyone and i'm: 1
you think that: 1
harry potter couldn't: 1
hermione granger only: 1
her light from: 1
you think those: 1
sake then she: 1
just stared along: 1
still that wasn't: 1
- i'm sorry: 1
ghosts weren't this: 1
the thought did: 1
harry if he: 1
much it hurts: 1
some of what: 1
them to think: 1
by doing so: 1
matter how you: 1
ran all the: 1
times over and: 1
should've heard the: 1
the wall so: 1
patronus charm said: 1
behavior for a: 1
innocent and you: 1
whisper said now: 1
your own affair: 1
caused you to: 1
questions unless she: 1
said - i: 1
must you be: 1
you live your: 1
said can i: 1
people who were: 1
padma patil can: 1
continued but hermione: 1

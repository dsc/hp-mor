# HP:MoR Character Dialogue Counts

As requested by the people doing the [audiobook](http://openetherpad.org/YvnjtzmvYi-EF-BB-BF), I've attempted to approximate of the number of "lines" each major character will speak.

Here's the global tally for the whole story:

    harry        1385
    draco         343
    hermione      203
    dumbledore    164
    quirrell      151
    mcgonagall    105
    neville        46
